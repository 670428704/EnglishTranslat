2,8,CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
3,8,The CFA Program is grounded in the practice of the investment profession  Beginning with the  Global Body of Investment Knowledge  GBIK  CFA Institute performs a continuous practice  analysis with investment professionals around the world to determine the competencies that are  relevant to the profession  Regional expert panels and targeted surveys are conducted annually  to verify and reinforce the continuous feedback from the GBIK collaborative website  The  practice analysis process ultimately defines the CBOK  The CBOK reflects the competencies  that are generally accepted and applied by investment professionals  These competencies are  used in practice in a generalist context and are expected to be demonstrated by a recently  qualified CFA charterholder 
4,8,The Education Advisory Committee consisting of practicing charterholders in conjunction  with CFA Institute staff designs the CFA Program curriculum in order to deliver the CBOK to  candidates  The examinations also written by charterholders are designed to allow you to  demonstrate your mastery of the CBOK as set forth in the CFA Program curriculum  As you  structure your personal study program you should emphasize mastery of the CBOK and the  practical application of that knowledge  For more information on the practice analysis CBOK  and development of the CFA Program curriculum please visit www cfainstitute org 
5,8,ORGANIZATION OF THE CURRICULUM
6,8,The Level I CFA Program curriculum is organized into    topic areas  Each topic area begins  with a brief statement of the material and the depth of knowledge expected 
7,8,Each topic area is then divided into one or more study sessions  These study sessions     sessions in the Level I curriculum should form the basic structure of your reading and  preparation 
8,8,Each study session includes a statement of its structure and objective and is further divided into  specific reading assignments  An outline illustrating the organization of these    study sessions  can be found at the front of each volume of the curriculum 
9,8,These readings are drawn from content commissioned by CFA Institute textbook chapters  professional journal articles research analyst reports and cases  Each reading includes LOS and  the core material to be studied often a combination of text exhibits and in text examples and  questions  A reading typically ends with practice problems followed by solutions to these  problems to help you understand and master the topic areas  The LOS indicate what you should  be able to accomplish after studying the material  The LOS the core material and the practice  problems are dependent on each other with the core material and practice problems providing  context for understanding the scope of the LOS and enabling you to apply a principle or concept  in a variety of scenarios

2,9,The entire readings including the practice problems at the end of the readings are the basis for  all examination questions and are selected or developed specifically to teach the knowledge and  skills reflected in the CBOK 
3,9,You should use the LOS to guide and focus your study because each examination question is  based on one or more LOS and the core material and practice problems associated with the  LOS  As a candidate you are responsible for the entirety of the required material in a study  session 
4,9,We encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website

8,9,FEATURES OF THE CURRICULUM
9,9,Begin optional segment
10,9,Required vs  Optional Segments
11,9,You should read all of an assigned reading  In some cases though we have reprinted an entire  chapter or article and marked certain parts of the reading as  optional   The CFA examination is  based only on the required segments and the optional segments are included only when it is  determined that they might help you to better understand the required segments  by seeing the  required material in its full context   When an optional segment begins you will see an icon and  a dashed vertical bar in the outside margin that will continue until the optional segment ends  accompanied by another icon  Unless the material is specifically marked as optional you  should assume it is required  You should rely on the required segments and the reading specific  LOS in preparing for the examination 
12,9,End optional segment
13,9,Practice Problems Solutions
14,9,All practice problems at the end of the readings as well as their solutions are part of the  curriculum and are required material for the exam  In addition to the in text examples and  questions these practice problems should help demonstrate practical applications and reinforce  your understanding of the concepts presented  Many of these practice problems are adapted  from past CFA examinations and or may serve as a basis for exam questions 
15,9,Glossary and Index
16,9,For your convenience we have printed a comprehensive glossary in each volume  Throughout  the curriculum a bolded word in a reading denotes a term defined in the glossary  The  curriculum eBook is searchable but we also publish an index that can be found on the CFA  Institute website with the Level I study sessions

2,10,LOS Self Check
3,10,We have inserted checkboxes next to each LOS that you can use to track your progress in  mastering the concepts in each reading 
4,10,Source Material
5,10,The authorship publisher and copyright owners are given for each reading for your reference   We recommend that you use the CFA Institute curriculum rather than the original source  materials because the curriculum may include only selected pages from outside readings  updated sections within the readings and problems and solutions tailored to the CFA Program   Note that some readings may contain a web address or URL  The referenced sites were live at  the time the reading was written but may have been deactivated since then 
6,10,Some readings in the curriculum cite articles published in the Financial Analysts  Journal  which is the flagship publication of CFA Institute  Since its launch in       the Financial Analysts Journal has established itself as the leading practitioner oriented  journal in the investment management community  Over the years it has advanced the  knowledge and understanding of the practice of investment management through the  publication of peer reviewed practitioner relevant research from leading academics and  practitioners  It has also featured thought provoking opinion pieces that advance the  common level of discourse within the investment management profession  Some of the  most influential research in the area of investment management has appeared in the  pages of the Financial Analysts Journal and    Nobel laureates have contributed more  than    articles 
7,10,Candidates are not responsible for familiarity with Financial Analysts Journal articles  that are cited in the curriculum  But as your time and studies allow we strongly  encourage you to begin supplementing your understanding of key investment  management issues by reading this practice oriented publication  Candidates have full  online access to the Financial Analysts Journal and associated resources  All you need  is to log in on www cfapubs org using your candidate credentials

2,11,Create a Schedule
3,11,An orderly systematic approach to exam preparation is critical  You should dedicate a  consistent block of time every week to reading and studying  Complete all reading assignments  and the associated problems and solutions in each study session  Review the LOS both before  and after you study each reading to ensure that you have mastered the applicable content and  can demonstrate the knowledge and skills described by the LOS and the assigned reading  Use  the LOS self check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for later review

8,11,CFA Institute Practice Questions
9,11,The CFA Institute practice question sets are intended to assess your mastery of individual topic  areas as you progress through your studies  After each practice question set you will receive  immediate feedback noting the correct responses and indicating the relevant assigned reading so  you can identify areas of weakness for further study  For more information on the practice  question sets please visit www cfainstitute org 
10,11,CFA Institute Mock Exams

16,16,   INTRODUCTION
17,16,In a general sense economics is the study of production distribution and consumption and can  be divided into two broad areas of study  macroeconomics and microeconomics   Macroeconomics deals with aggregate economic quantities such as national output and  national income and is rooted in microeconomics which deals with markets and decision  making of individual economic units including consumers and businesses  Microeconomics is a  logical starting point for the study of economics

2,17,Microeconomics classifies private economic units into two groups  consumers  or households   and firms  These two groups give rise respectively to the theory of the consumer and the  theory of the firm as two branches of study  The theory of the consumer deals with consumption   the demand for goods and services  by utility maximizing individuals  i e  individuals who  make decisions that maximize the satisfaction received from present and future consumption    The theory of the firm deals with the supply of goods and services by profit maximizing firms 
3,17,It is expected that candidates will be familiar with the basic concepts of demand and supply   This material is covered in detail in the recommended prerequisite readings  In this reading we  will explore how buyers and sellers interact to determine transaction prices and quantities  The  reading is organized as follows  Section   discusses the consumer or demand side of the market  model and Section   discusses the supply side of the consumer goods market paying particular  attention to the firm s costs  Section   provides a summary of key points in the reading 
4,17,   DEMAND ANALYSIS  THE CONSUMER
5,17,The fundamental model of the private enterprise economy is the demand and supply model of  the market  In this section we examine three important topics concerning the demand side of  the model      elasticities     substitution and income effects and     normal and inferior  goods  The candidate is assumed to have a basic understanding of the demand and supply model  and to understand how a market discovers the equilibrium price at which the quantity willingly  demanded by consumers at that price is just equal to the quantity willingly supplied by firms   Here we explore more deeply some of the concepts underlying the demand side of the model 
6,17,     Demand Concepts
7,17,The quantity of a good that consumers are willing to buy depends on a number of different  variables  Perhaps the most important of those variables is the item s own price  In general  economists believe that as the price of a good rises buyers will choose to buy less of it and as  its price falls they buy more  This opinion is so nearly universal that it has come to be called
8,17,the law of demand 
9,17,Although a good s own price is important in determining consumers  willingness to purchase it  other variables also influence that decision  Consumers  incomes their tastes and preferences  and the prices of other goods that serve as substitutes or complements are just a few of the other  variables that influence consumers  demand for a product or service  Economists attempt to  capture all these influences in a relationship called the demand function   A function is a  relationship that assigns a unique value to a dependent variable for any given set of values of a  group of independent variables  
10,17,Equation   is an example of a demand function  In Equation   we are saying  The quantity  demanded of good X depends on  is a function of  the price of good X consumers  income and  the price of good Y

3,18,Qd
4,18,x   the quantity demanded of some good X  such as per household demand for gasoline in  liters per month 
5,18,Px   the price per unit of good X  such as   per liter 
6,18,I   consumers  income  as in      s per household annually 
7,18,Py   the price of another good Y   There can be many other goods not just one and they can  be complements or substitutes  
8,18,Often economists use simple linear equations to approximate real world demand and supply  functions in relevant ranges  Equation   illustrates a hypothetical example of our function for  gasoline demand 
9,18,Equation    
10,18,Qd
11,18,x              Px       I    Py
12,18,where the quantity of gasoline demanded  Qd x   is a function of the price of a liter of gasoline   Px  consumers  income in      s  I  and the average price of an automobile in      s  Py  
13,18,The signs of the coefficients on gasoline price  negative  and consumers  income  positive   reflect the relationship between those variables and the quantity of gasoline consumed  The  negative sign on average automobile price indicates that if automobiles go up in price fewer  will likely be purchased and driven  hence less gasoline will be consumed   As discussed later  such a relationship would indicate that gasoline and automobiles have a negative cross price  elasticity of demand and are thus complements  
14,18,To continue our example suppose that the price of gasoline  Px  is       per liter per  household income  I  is        and the price of the average automobile  Py  is         In this  case this function would predict that the per household monthly demand for gasoline would be        liters calculated as follows 
15,18,Qd
16,18,x                                               
17,18,recalling that income and automobile prices are measured in thousands  Note that the sign on  the  own price  variable  Px  is negative  thus as the price of gasoline rises per household  consumption would decrease by      liters per month for every    increase in gas price  Own  price is used by economists to underscore that the reference is to the price of a good itself and  not the price of some other good 
18,18,In our example there are three independent variables in the demand function and one dependent  variable  If any one of the independent variables changes so does the quantity demanded  It is  often desirable to concentrate on the relationship between the dependent variable and just one of  the independent variables at a time  To accomplish this goal we can hold the other independent  variables constant and rewrite the equation 
19,18,For example to concentrate on the relationship between the quantity demanded of the good and  its own price Px we hold constant the values of income and the price of good Y  In our  example those values are    and    respectively  The equation would then be rewritten as

4,19,The quantity of gasoline demanded is a function of the price of gasoline       per liter  per  household income          and the average price of an automobile           Notice that  income and the price of automobiles are not ignored  they are simply held constant and they are   collected  in the new constant term                                   Notice also that we can  solve for Px in terms of Qd x by rearranging Equation   which gives us Equation

6,19,Px               Qd

8,19,Equation   gives the price of gasoline as a function of the quantity of gasoline consumed per  month and is referred to as the inverse demand function  Qx in Equation   must be restricted  to be less than or equal to    so that price is not negative  The graph of the inverse demand  function is called the demand curve and is shown in Exhibit    
9,19,Exhibit    Household Demand Curve for Gasoline
10,19,The demand curve represents the highest quantity willingly purchased at each price as well as  the highest price willingly paid for each quantity  In this example this household would be  willing to purchase       liters of gasoline per month at a price of       per liter  If price were  to rise to       per liter the household would be willing to purchase only       liters per  month

2,20,This demand curve is drawn with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis   It can be correctly interpreted as specifying either the highest quantity a household would buy  at a given price or the highest price it would be willing to pay for a given quantity  In our  example at a price of       per liter households would each be willing to buy       liters per  month  Alternatively the highest price they would be willing to pay for       liters per month  is       per liter  If the price were to rise by    households would reduce the quantity they  each bought by      units to       liters  The slope of the demand curve is measured as the  change in price P divided by the change in quantity Q   P  Q where   stands for  the  change in    In this case the slope of the demand curve is         or        
3,20,The general model of demand and supply can be highly useful in understanding directional  changes in prices and quantities that result from shifts in one curve or the other  Often though  we need to measure how sensitive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes in the  independent variables that affect them  This is the concept of elasticity of demand and  elasticity of supply  Fundamentally all elasticities are calculated in the same way  They are  ratios of percentage changes  Let us begin with the sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes  in the own price 
4,20,     Own Price Elasticity of Demand
5,20,In Equation   we expressed the quantity demanded of some good as a function of several  variables one of which was the price of the good itself  the good s  own price   
6,20,In Equation   we introduced a hypothetical household demand function for gasoline assuming  that the household s income and the price of another good  automobiles  were held constant   That function was given by the simple linear expression Qd x            Px  Using this  expression if we were asked how sensitive the quantity of gasoline demanded is to changes in  price we might say that whenever price changes by one unit quantity changes by      units in  the opposite direction  for example if price were to rise by    quantity demanded would fall by       liters per month  The coefficient on the price variable         could be the measure of  sensitivity we are seeking 
7,20,There is a drawback associated with that measure however  It is dependent on the units in  which we measured Q and P  When we want to describe the sensitivity of demand we need to  recall the specific units in which Q and P were measured liters per month and euros per  liter in our example  This relationship cannot readily be extrapolated to other units of  measure for example gallons and dollars  Economists therefore prefer to use a gauge of  sensitivity that does not depend on units of measure  That metric is called elasticity  Elasticity  is a general measure of how sensitive one variable is to any other variable and it is expressed as  the ratio of percentage changes in each variable    y   x  In the case of own price elasticity  of demand that measure is illustrated in Equation

2,21,This equation expresses the sensitivity of the quantity demanded to a change in price  E d px is the  good s own price elasticity and is equal to the percentage change in quantity demanded divided  by the percentage change in price  This measure is independent of the units in which quantity  and price are measured  If quantity demanded falls by    when price rises by     then the  elasticity of demand is simply       It does not matter whether we are measuring quantity in  gallons per week or liters per day and it does not matter whether we measure price in dollars  per gallon or euros per liter      is     and    is     So the ratio of the first to the second is  still      
3,21,We can expand Equation   algebraically by noting that the percentage change in any variable x is simply the change in x   x  divided by the level of x  So we can rewrite Equation   using a  few simple steps as

25,21,To get a better idea of price elasticity it might be helpful to illustrate using our hypothetical  demand function  Qd x            Px  When the relationship between two variables is linear  x  Px is equal to the slope coefficient on Px in the demand function  Thus in our example  the elasticity of demand is       multiplied by the ratio of price to quantity  We need to choose  a price at which to calculate the elasticity coefficient  Using our hypothetical original price of        we can find the quantity associated with that particular price by inserting      into the  demand function as given in Equation   
26,21,Q                            
27,21,and we find that Q         liters per month 
28,21,The result of our calculation is that at a price of      the elasticity of our market demand  function is                           How do we interpret that value  It means simply that  when price equals      a    rise in price would result in a fall in quantity demanded of      
29,21,In our example when the price is       per liter demand is not very sensitive to changes in  price because a    rise in price would reduce quantity demanded by only       In this case we  would say that demand is inelastic  To be precise when the magnitude  ignoring algebraic  sign  of the own price elasticity coefficient has a value of less than one demand is said to be  inelastic  When that magnitude is greater than one demand is said to be elastic  And when the  elasticity coefficient is equal to negative one demand is said to be unit elastic or unitary  elastic  Note that if the law of demand holds own price elasticity of demand will always be  negative because a rise in price will be associated with a fall in quantity demanded but it can be  either elastic  very sensitive to a change in price  or inelastic  insensitive to a change in price    In our hypothetical example suppose the price of gasoline was very high say    per liter  In  this case the elasticity coefficient would be

2,22,Because the magnitude of the elasticity coefficient is greater than one we know that demand is  elastic at that price   In other words at lower prices        per liter  a slight change in the price  of gasoline does not have much effect on the quantity demanded but when gasoline is  expensive     per liter  consumer demand for gas is highly affected by changes in price 
3,22,By examining Equation   more closely we can see that for a linear demand curve the elasticity  depends on where on the curve we calculate it  The first term  Q  P which is the inverse of  the slope of the demand curve remains constant along the entire demand curve  But the second  term P Q changes depending on where we are on the demand curve  At very low prices P Q is  very small so demand is inelastic  But at very high prices Q is low and P is high so the ratio  P Q is very high and demand is elastic  Exhibit   illustrates a characteristic of all negatively  sloped linear demand curves  Above the midpoint of the curve demand is elastic  below the  midpoint demand is inelastic  and at the midpoint demand is unit elastic 
4,22,Exhibit    The Elasticity of a Linear Demand Curve
5,22,       Extremes of Price Elasticity
6,22,There are two special cases in which linear demand curves have the same elasticity at all points   vertical demand curves and horizontal demand curves  Consider a vertical demand curve as in  Panel A of Exhibit   and a horizontal demand curve as in Panel B  In the first case the  quantity demanded is the same regardless of price  There is no demand curve that is perfectly  vertical at all possible prices but it is reasonable to assume that over some range of prices the  same quantity would be purchased at a slightly higher price or a slightly lower price  Thus in  that price range quantity demanded is not at all sensitive to price and we would say that  demand is perfectly inelastic in that range

2,23,Exhibit    The Extremes of Price Elasticity
3,23,In the second case the demand curve is horizontal at some given price  It implies that even a  minute price increase will reduce demand to zero but at that given price the consumer would  buy some large unknown amount  This situation is a reasonable description of the demand  curve facing an individual seller in a perfectly competitive market such as the wheat market  At  the current market price of wheat an individual farmer could sell all she has  If however she  held out for a price above market price it is reasonable to believe that she would not be able to  sell any at all  other farmers  wheat is a perfect substitute for hers so no one would be willing  to buy any of hers at a higher price  In this case we would say that the demand curve facing a  seller under conditions of perfect competition is perfectly elastic 
4,23,       Predicting Demand Elasticity
5,23,Own price elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to  changes in the price of a good or service but what characteristics of a good or its market might  be informative in determining whether demand is highly elastic  Perhaps the most important  characteristic is whether there are close substitutes for the good in question  If there are close  substitutes for the good then if its price rises even slightly a consumer would tend to purchase  much less of this good and switch to the less costly substitute  If there are no substitutes  however then it is likely that the demand is much less elastic  Consider a consumer s demand  for some broadly defined product such as bread  There really are no close substitutes for the  entire category of bread which includes all types from French bread to pita bread to tortillas  and so on  So if the price of all bread were to rise perhaps a consumer would purchase a little  less of it each week but probably not a significantly smaller amount  Now consider that the  consumer s demand is for a particular baker s specialty bread instead of the category  bread  as  a whole  Surely there are close substitutes for Baker Bob s Whole Wheat Bread with Sesame  Seeds than for bread in general  We would expect then that the demand for Baker Bob s  special loaf is much more elastic than for the entire category of bread

2,24,In addition to the degree of substitutability other characteristics tend to be generally predictive  of a good s elasticity of demand  These include the portion of the typical budget that is spent on  the good the amount of time that is allowed to respond to the change in price the extent to  which the good is seen as necessary or optional and so on  In general if consumers tend to  spend a very small portion of their budget on a good their demand tends to be less elastic than  if they spend a very large part of their income  Most people spend only a little on toothpaste  each month for example so it really does not matter whether the price rises      They would  probably still buy about the same amount  If the price of housing were to rise significantly  however most households would try to find a way to reduce the quantity they buy at least in  the long run 
3,24,This example leads to another characteristic regarding price elasticity  For most goods and  services the long run demand is much more elastic than the short run demand  For example if  the price of gasoline rises we probably would not be able to respond quickly to reduce the  quantity we consume  In the short run we tend to be locked into modes of transportation  housing and employment location and so on  With a longer adjustment period however we  can adjust the quantity consumed in response to the change in price by adopting a new mode of  transportation or reducing the distance of our commute  Hence for most goods long run  elasticity of demand is greater than short run elasticity  Durable goods however tend to behave  in the opposite way  If the price of washing machines were to fall people might react quickly  because they have an old machine that they know will need to be replaced fairly soon anyway   So when price falls they might decide to go ahead and make a purchase  If the price of washing  machines were to stay low forever however it is unlikely that a typical consumer would buy  more machines over a lifetime 
4,24,Knowing whether the good or service is seen to be discretionary or non discretionary helps to  understand its sensitivity to a price change  Faced with the same percentage increase in prices  consumers are much more likely to give up their Friday night restaurant meal  discretionary   than they are to cut back significantly on staples in their pantry  non discretionary   The more a  good is seen as being necessary the less elastic its demand is likely to be 
5,24,In summary own price elasticity of demand is likely to be greater  i e  more sensitive  for  items that have many close substitutes occupy a large portion of the total budget are seen to be  optional instead of necessary or have longer adjustment times  Obviously not all these  characteristics operate in the same direction for all goods so elasticity is likely to be a complex  result of these and other characteristics  In the end the actual elasticity of demand for a  particular good turns out to be an empirical fact that can be learned only from careful  observation and often sophisticated statistical analysis 
6,24,       Elasticity and Total Expenditure
7,24,Because of the law of demand an increase in price is associated with a decrease in the number  of units demanded of some good or service  But what can we say about the total expenditure on  that good  That is what happens to price times quantity when price falls  Recall that elasticity  is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change  in price  So if demand is elastic a decrease in price is associated with a larger percentage rise in  quantity demanded  Although each unit of the good has a lower price a sufficiently greater  number of units are purchased so that total expenditure  price times quantity  would rise as  price falls when demand is elastic

2,25,If demand is inelastic however a given percentage decrease in price is associated with a  smaller percentage rise in quantity demanded  Consequently when demand is inelastic a fall in  price brings about a fall in total expenditure 
3,25,In summary when demand is elastic price and total expenditure move in opposite directions   When demand is inelastic price and total expenditure move in the same direction  This  relationship is easy to identify in the case of a linear demand curve  Recall that above the  midpoint demand is elastic and below the midpoint demand is inelastic  In the upper section  of Exhibit   total expenditure  P   Q  is measured as the area of a rectangle whose base is Q and height is P  Notice that as price falls the areas of the inscribed rectangles  each outlined  with their own dotted or dashed line  at first grow in size become largest at the midpoint of the  demand curve and thereafter become smaller as price continues to fall and total expenditure  declines toward zero  In the lower section of Exhibit   total expenditure is shown for each  quantity purchased

2,26,The relationships just described hold for any demand curve so it does not matter whether we  are dealing with the demand curve of an individual consumer the demand curve of the market  or the demand curve facing any given seller  For a market the total expenditure by buyers  becomes the total revenue to sellers in that market  It follows then that if market demand is  elastic a fall in price will result in an increase in total revenue to sellers as a whole and if  demand is inelastic a fall in price will result in a decrease in total revenue to sellers  If the  demand faced by any given seller were inelastic at the current price that seller could increase  revenue by increasing its price  But because demand is negatively sloped the increase in price  would decrease total units sold which would almost certainly decrease total production cost  If  raising price both increases revenue and decreases cost such a move would always be profit  enhancing  Faced with inelastic demand a one product seller would always be inclined to raise  the price until the point at which demand becomes elastic 
3,26,     Income Elasticity of Demand
4,26,Elasticity is a measure of how sensitive one variable is to change in the value of another  variable  Up to this point we have focused on price elasticity but the quantity demanded of a  good is also a function of consumer income 
5,26,Income elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded  x   divided by the percentage change in income    I  holding all other things constant  as shown in Equation

13,26,The structure of this expression is identical to the structure of own price elasticity given in  Equation     All elasticity measures that we will examine have the same general structure  the  only thing that changes is the independent variable of interest   For example if the income  elasticity of demand for some good has a value of     we would interpret that to mean that  whenever income rises by    the quantity demanded at each price would rise by      
14,26,Although own price elasticity of demand will almost always be negative income elasticity of  demand can be negative positive or zero  Positive income elasticity means that as income rises  quantity demanded also rises  Negative income elasticity of demand means that when people  experience a rise in income they buy less of these goods and when their income falls they buy  more of the same good 
15,26,Goods with positive income elasticity are called  normal  goods  Goods with negative income  elasticity are called  inferior  goods  Typical examples of inferior goods are rice potatoes or  less expensive cuts of meat  We will discuss the concepts of normal and inferior goods in a later  section

2,27,In our discussion of the demand curve we held all other things constant including consumer  income to plot the relationship between price and quantity demanded  If income were to  change the entire demand curve would shift one way or the other  For normal goods a rise in  income would shift the entire demand curve upward and to the right  For inferior goods  however a rise in income would result in a downward and leftward shift in the entire demand  curve 
3,27,     Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
4,27,We previously discussed a good s own price elasticity  However the price of another good  might also have an impact on the demand for that good or service and we should be able to  define an elasticity with respect to the other price  Py  as well  That elasticity is called the  cross price elasticity of demand and takes on the same structure as own price elasticity and  income elasticity of demand as represented in Equation   
5,27,Equation    
6,27,E d
7,27,py  
8,27,  Qd
9,27,x
10,27,  Py
11,27,Note how similar this equation is to the equation for own price elasticity  The only difference is  that the subscript on P is now y where y indicates some other good  This cross price elasticity  of demand measures how sensitive the demand for good X is to changes in the price of some  other good Y holding all other things constant  For some pairs of goods X and Y when the  price of Y rises more of good X is demanded  the cross price elasticity of demand is positive   Those goods are referred to as substitutes  In economics if the cross price elasticity of two  goods is positive they are substitutes irrespective of whether someone would consider them   similar  
12,27,This concept is intuitive if you think about two goods that are seen to be close substitutes  perhaps like two brands of beer  When the price of one of your favorite brands of beer rises you  would probably buy less of that brand and more of a cheaper brand so the cross price elasticity  of demand would be positive  For substitute goods an increase in the price of one good would  shift the demand curve for the other good upward and to the right 
13,27,Alternatively two goods whose cross price elasticity of demand is negative are said to be  complements  Typically these goods tend to be consumed together as a pair such as gasoline  and automobiles or houses and furniture  When automobile prices fall we might expect the  quantity of autos demanded to rise and thus we might expect to see a rise in the demand for  gasoline 
14,27,Whether two goods are substitutes or complements might not be immediately intuitive  For  example grocery stores often put things like coffee on sale in the hope that customers will  come in for coffee and end up doing their weekly shopping there as well  In that case coffee  and say cabbage could very well empirically turn out to be complements even though we  would not think that the price of coffee has any relation to sales of cabbage  Regardless of  whether someone would see two goods as related in some fashion if the cross price elasticity of  two goods is negative they are complements

2,28,Although a conceptual understanding of demand elasticities is helpful in sorting out the  qualitative and directional effects among variables using an empirically estimated demand  function can yield insights into the behavior of a market  For illustration let us return to our  hypothetical individual demand function for gasoline in Equation   duplicated here for  convenience 
3,28,Qd
4,28,x              Px       I    Py
5,28,The quantity demanded of a given good  Qd x   is a function of its own price  Px  consumer  income  I  and the price of another good  Py  
6,28,To derive the market demand function the individual consumers  demand functions are simply  added together  If there were      individuals who represented a market and they all had  identical demand functions the market demand function would be the individual consumer s  demand function multiplied by the number of consumers  Using the individual demand function  given by Equation   the market demand function would be as shown in Equation   
7,28,Equation    
8,28,Qd
9,28,x               Px      I       Py
10,28,Earlier when we calculated own price elasticity of demand we needed to choose a price at  which to calculate the elasticity coefficient  Similarly we need to choose actual values for the  independent variables Px I and Py and insert these values into the  estimated  market  demand function to find the quantity demanded  Choosing       for Px      in thousands  for  I and      in thousands  for Py we find that the quantity of gasoline demanded is       liters  per month  We now have everything we need to calculate own price income and cross price  elasticities of demand for our market  Those elasticities are expressed in Equations       and      Each of those expressions has a term denoting the change in quantity divided by the change  in each respective variable  own price  Qx  Px  income  Qx  I and cross price  Qx  Py 
11,28,As we stated in the discussion of own price elasticity when the relationship between two  variables is linear the change in quantity   Qd x   divided by the change in own price   Px   income   I  or cross price   Py  is equal to the slope coefficient on that other variable  The  elasticities are calculated by inserting the slope coefficients from Equation   into the elasticity  formulas

15,29,In our example at a price of       the own price elasticity of demand is        a    increase  in the price of gasoline leads to a decrease in quantity demanded of about        Equation       Because the absolute value of the own price elasticity is less than one we characterize demand  as being inelastic at that price  for example an increase in price would result in an increase in  total expenditure on gasoline by consumers in that market  The income elasticity of demand is        Equation      A    increase in income would result in an increase of       in the  quantity demanded of gasoline  Because that elasticity is positive  but small  we would  characterize gasoline as a normal good  The cross price elasticity of demand between gasoline  and automobiles is        Equation      If the price of automobiles rose by    the demand for  gasoline would fall by        We would therefore characterize gasoline and automobiles as  complements because the cross price elasticity is negative  The magnitude is quite small  however so we would conclude that the complementary relationship is weak 
16,29,EXAMPLE  
17,29,Calculating Elasticities from a Given Demand  Function
18,29,An individual consumer s monthly demand for downloadable e books is given by the  equation Qd eb          Peb         I       Phb where Qd eb equals the number of e books  demanded each month I equals the household monthly income Peb equals the price of  e books and Phb equals the price of hardbound books  Assume that the price of e books  is        household income is       and the price of hardbound books is        
19,29,   Determine the value of own price elasticity of demand for e books 
20,29,   Determine the income elasticity of demand for e books 
21,29,   Determine the cross price elasticity of demand for e books with respect to the  price of hardbound books 
22,29,Solution to   
23,29,The own price elasticity of demand is given by   Qd eb    Notice from  the demand function that  Qd eb  Peb         Inserting the given variable values into  the demand function yields Qd eb                                                             So at a price of        the own price elasticity of demand equals                               which is elastic because in absolute value the elasticity  coefficient is greater than

3,30,Recall that income elasticity of demand is given by   Qd eb    Notice from  the demand function that  Qd eb  I           Inserting the values for I and Qd eb yields  income elasticity of                              which is positive so e books are a  normal good

7,30,     Substitution and Income Effects
8,30,The law of demand states that if nothing changes other than the price of a particular good or  service itself a decrease in that good s price will tend to result in a greater quantity of that good  being purchased  Simply stated it is the assumption that a demand curve has negative slope   that is where price per unit is measured on the vertical axis and quantity demanded per time  period is measured on the horizontal axis the demand curve is falling from left to right as  shown in Exhibit   
9,30,Exhibit    A Negatively Sloped Demand Curve The Law of Demand

2,31,There are two reasons why a consumer would be expected to purchase more of a good when its  price falls and less of a good when its price rises  These two reasons are known as the  substitution effect and the income effect of a change in price  We address these two effects  separately and then examine the combination of the two 
3,31,When the price of something say gasoline falls that good becomes relatively less costly  compared with other goods or services a consumer might purchase  For example gasoline is  used in driving to work so when its price falls it is relatively cheaper to drive to work than to  take public transportation  Hence the consumer is likely to substitute a little more driving to  work for a little less public transportation  When the price of beef falls it becomes relatively  cheaper than chicken  The typical consumer is therefore likely to purchase a little more beef  and a little less chicken 
4,31,On its own the substitution effect suggests that when the price of something falls consumers  tend to purchase more of that good  But another influence is often at work as well the income  effect  Consider a consumer spending all of her  money income  on a given combination of  goods and services   Her money income is simply the quantity of dollars or euros or other  relevant currency that is available to her to spend in any given time period   Now suppose the  price of something she was regularly purchasing falls while her money income and the prices of  all other goods remain unchanged  Economists refer to this as an increase in purchasing power  or real income  For most goods and services consumers tend to buy more of them when their  income rises  So when the price of a good say beef falls most consumers would tend to buy  more beef because of the increase in their real income  Although the consumer s money income   the number on her paycheck  is assumed not to have changed her real income has risen  because she can now buy more beef and other goods too as a result of the fall in the price of  that one good  So quite apart from the substitution effect of a fall in a good s price the income  effect tends to cause consumers to purchase more of that good as well 
5,31,Substitution and income effects work the other way too  If the price of beef were to rise the  substitution effect would cause the consumer to buy less of it and substitute more chicken for  the now relatively more expensive beef  Additionally the rise in the price of beef results in a  decrease in the consumer s real income because now she can buy less goods with the same  amount of money income  If beef is a good that consumers tend to buy more of when their  income rises and less of when their income falls then the rise in beef price would have an  income effect that causes the consumer to buy less of it 
6,31,     Normal and Inferior Goods
7,31,Economists classify goods on various dimensions one of which relates to how consumers   purchases of a good respond to changes in consumer income  Earlier when discussing income  elasticity of demand we introduced the concept of normal goods and inferior goods  For most  goods and services an increase in income would cause consumers to buy more  these are called  normal goods  But that does not hold true for all goods  There are goods that consumers buy  less of when their income rises and goods that they buy more of when their incomes fall  These  are called inferior goods  This section will distinguish between normal goods and inferior  goods 
8,31,We previously discussed income and substitution effects of a change in price  If a good is  normal a decrease in price will result in the consumer buying more of that good  Both the  substitution effect and the income effect are at play here

2,32,  A decrease in price tends to cause consumers to buy more of this good in place of other  goods the substitution effect 
3,32,  The increase in real income resulting from the decline in this good s price causes people  to buy even more of this good when its price falls the income effect 
4,32,So we can say that for normal goods  restaurant meals for example as most people tend to eat  out more often when their incomes rise  the substitution and the income effects reinforce one  another to cause the demand curve to be negatively sloped 
5,32,For inferior goods  cheaper cuts of meat or generic beverages for example which most people  buy less of as their incomes rise  an increase in income causes consumers to buy less not more  and if their incomes fall they buy more not less   Inferior  does not imply anything at all about  the quality of the good  it is simply used to refer to a good for which an increase in income  causes some people to buy less of it 
6,32,The same good could be normal for some consumers while it is inferior for others  Consider a  very low income segment of the population  For those consumers an increase in their income  might very well result in their buying more fast food meals  They might take some of that  added income and enjoy eating out at a fast food restaurant a little more often  Now consider a  high income group  If their income rises they might be much less inclined to eat at fast food  restaurants and instead do their dining out at a fashionable French bistro for example  So fast  food meals might be a normal good for some people and an inferior good for others 
7,32,Let us now consider the substitution and income effects of a change in the price of normal and  inferior goods  The substitution effect says that if the price of a good falls the consumer will  substitute more of this good in the consumption bundle and buy less of some other good  The  substitution effect is true for both normal and inferior goods  Next we provide an example 
8,32,We begin with a hypothetical consumer with a certain money income  R          Given the  prices for all goods he makes a decision to buy a given amount of Good X coffee  If the price  of coffee falls the consumer is better off than when the price was higher  We can assume that  this consumer would have been willing to pay some amount of money each month to be able to  buy coffee at the lower price  We now have two states of the world  In State   he spends his  income on all the various goods including his desired quantity of coffee at the original price  In  State   he is able to buy coffee at the new lower price but because he has paid a portion of his  income to buy coffee at the lower price he now has less money income to spend on all goods  combined  If we adjusted the amount of money he would have to pay to lock in the lower price  of coffee until he is just indifferent between the two states of the world we would have exactly  offset the  good  thing of the lower price with the  bad  thing of less income  This removes the  income effect of the price decrease and allows us to isolate the pure substitution effect  We find  that in State   he would buy more coffee than in State    The pure substitution effect is always  in the direction of buying more at the lower relative price 
9,32,Continuing our example assume that we give back to the consumer the amount of money he is  willing to pay for the privilege of buying coffee at the lower price  Clearly he is better off  because now he can buy coffee at the lower price without having to pay for the privilege  We  want to know whether with this higher money income he will now buy more or less coffee at  the lower price  The answer depends on whether coffee is a normal or an inferior good for this  consumer  Recall that for normal goods an increase in income causes consumers to buy more  but for inferior goods an increase in income causes consumers to buy less

2,33,In conclusion the substitution effect of a change in the price of a good will always be in the  direction of buying more at a lower price or less at a higher price  The income effect of that  same price change however depends on whether the good is normal or inferior  If the good is  normal the income effect reinforces the substitution effect both leading to a negatively sloped  demand curve  But if the good is inferior the income effect and the substitution effect work in  opposite directions  the income effect tends to mitigate the substitution effect 
3,33,Exhibit   summarizes the substitution and income effects for normal and inferior goods 
4,33,Exhibit    The Substitution and Income Effects of a Price Decrease on Normal  and Inferior Goods
5,33,Normal  good
6,33,Inferior  good
7,33,Substitution Effect Buy more because the  good is relatively cheaper  than its substitutes  Buy more because the  good is relatively cheaper  than its substitutes 
8,33,Income Effect Buy more because the increase in  purchasing power raises the total  consumption level  Buy less because the increase in real  income prompts the consumer to buy less  of the inferior good in favor of its  preferred substitutes 
9,33,Exceptions to the Law of Demand
10,33,In virtually every case in the real world the law of demand holds  A decrease in price  results in an increase in quantity demanded resulting in a negatively sloped demand  curve  In a few unusual cases however we may find a positively sloped demand  curve a decrease  increase  in price may result in a decrease  increase  in the quantity  demanded  These unusual cases are called Giffen goods and Veblen goods

2,34,In theory it is possible for the income effect to be so strong and so negative as to  overpower the substitution effect  In such a case more of a good would be consumed as  the price rises and less would be consumed as the price falls  These goods are called  Giffen goods named for Robert Giffen based on his observations of the purchasing  habits of the Victorian era poor  For many decades no one really believed that a Giffen  good actually existed anywhere other than in textbooks  But in recent years studies have  documented a few rare cases  One study was conducted in a poor rural community  where individuals spend a very large portion of their incomes on rice  For these  individuals rice was an inferior good  Under the law of demand the quantity of rice  purchased would rise with the decline in price but the rise in quantity would be partially  offset by the income effect  a decrease in the amount of rice purchased as a result of  rising incomes   What the experimenters discovered however was that for a certain  subset of consumers the quantity of rice purchased declined in absolute terms the  income effect actually overwhelmed the substitution effect  For consumers living at  subsistence levels incomes just barely sufficient to enable them to meet their caloric  intake needs a decline in the price of the staple enabled them to shift more of their  consumption from rice to the alternate sources of calories in their diet  e g  meat  
3,34,With some goods the item s price tag itself might drive the consumer s preferences for  it  Thorstein Veblen posited just such a circumstance in his concept of conspicuous  consumption  According to this way of thinking a consumer might derive utility out of  being known by others to consume a so called high status good such as a luxury  automobile or a very expensive piece of jewelry  Importantly it is the high price itself  that partly imparts value to such a good  These are called Veblen goods and they  derive their value from the consumption of them as symbols of the purchaser s high  status in society  they are certainly not inferior goods  It is argued that by increasing the  price of a Veblen good the consumer would be more inclined to purchase it not less 
4,34,EXAMPLE  
5,34,Income and Substitution Effects of a  Decrease in Price
6,34,Monica has a monthly entertainment budget that she spends on  a  movies and  b  an  assortment of other entertainment items  When the price of each movie is    she spends  a quarter of her budget on six movies a month and the rest of her budget on other  entertainment  Monica was offered an opportunity to join a movie club at her local  theater that allows her to purchase movies at half the regular price and she can choose  each month whether to join the movie club or not  There is a membership fee she must  pay for each month she belongs to the club  Monica is exactly indifferent between  a   not buying the membership and therefore paying    for movies and  b  buying the  membership and paying    per movie  So she flips a coin each month to determine  whether to join the club that month  In months that she does join the club she sees eight  movies  For her birthday a friend gave her a one month club membership as a gift and  that month she saw    movies 
7,34,   If there were no club and the price of movies were to simply fall from    to     how many more movies would Monica buy each month

2,35,   Determine how much Monica is willing to pay each month for the privilege of  buying movies at half price   What is the value of X that makes her indifferent  between joining the club and not joining it  
3,35,   Of the increased number of movies Monica would purchase if the price were to  fall from    to    determine how much of the increase would be attributable to  the substitution effect and how much to the income effect of that price decrease 
4,35,   For Monica are movies a normal inferior or Giffen good 
5,35,Solution to   
6,35,Six movies  When her friend gave her a club membership she bought    movies instead  of her usual    With the gift of the club membership Monica could buy movies at a  price of    without paying for that privilege  This is the same as if the price of each  movie fell from    to    
7,35,Solution to   
8,35,Note that Monica is indifferent between two states of the world  State A in which she  has all of her entertainment budget to spend on movies and other entertainment but must  pay full price of    per movie and State B in which she has to pay some dollar amount  X for the privilege of buying movies at half price  So X is the maximum she would pay  for a membership fee  She buys eight movies in months when she joins the club   Without a club membership those movies would cost her        movies        With a  club membership the movies would cost her        movies        So the most she is  willing to pay for a club membership is       Note that one might be tempted to say she  would be willing to pay only     for the membership because she was buying six  movies at    spending     whereas if she were able to buy six movies at only    per  movie she would have to spend only      But because of the substitution effect she  would now be willing to buy more movies than before so her benefit from the half price  privilege is worth more than      
9,35,Solution to   
10,35,When Monica pays the club membership herself she buys eight movies two more than  usual  Because Monica is equally well off whether she joins the club for a monthly fee  and thereby pays half price or whether she does not join the club and pays full price we  can say that the income effect of the price decrease has been removed by charging her  the monthly fee  So the increase from six movies to eight is the result of the substitution  effect  When Monica s friend gave her the gift of a club membership allowing her to  pay half price without paying for the privilege Monica bought    movies   more than  usual and   more than she would have had she paid the membership fee  The increase  from   movies to    is the result of the income effect 
11,35,Solution to   
12,35,When the price fell from    to    Monica bought more movies so clearly movies are  not a Giffen good for her  Additionally because the substitution effect and the income  effect are in the same direction of buying more movies they are a normal good for  Monica  The substitution effect caused her to buy two more movies and the income  effect caused her to buy an additional four movies

3,36,To fully comprehend the supply side of a consumer goods market an analyst must understand  the firm s costs   As a reminder this reading builds on the basics of the market model as  covered in the recommended prerequisite reading material  
4,36,The firm s marginal cost is the foundation of the firm s ability and willingness to offer a given  quantity for sale and its costs depend on both the productivity of its inputs and their prices  In  this section we will describe the firm s cost curves total average and marginal costs in both  the short run and in the long run paying special attention to what economists call the law of  diminishing marginal returns  We will then use this information to explore the conditions  under which a firm would find it beneficial to continue operation even if its economic profits  are negative and at what levels of production its shutdown and breakeven points occur  Long  run costs will be examined in the context of economies and diseconomies of scale 
5,36,     Marginal Returns and Productivity
6,36,There is an economic phenomenon known as increasing marginal returns in which  marginal product the productivity of each additional unit of a resource increases as  additional units of that input are employed 
7,36,Initially a firm can experience increasing returns from adding labor to the production process  because of the concepts of specialization and division of labor  At first by having too few  workers relative to total physical capital the understaffing situation requires employees to  multi task and share duties  As more workers are added employees can specialize become  more adept at their individual functions and realize an increase in marginal productivity  But  after a certain output level the law of diminishing marginal returns becomes evident 
8,36,When more and more workers are added to a fixed capital base the marginal return of the labor  factor eventually decreases because the fixed input restricts the output potential of additional  workers  As an illustration consider automobile production  When an auto manufacturing plant  is operating at full capacity adding additional labor will not increase production because the  physical plant is already      employed  More labor hours will merely add to costs without  adding to output  Assuming all workers are of equal quality and motivation the decline in  marginal product occurs in the short run where all other resources  typically plant size  physical capital and technology  are fixed 
9,36,Marginal returns are directly related to input productivity a measure of the output per unit of  input

2,37,       Productivity  The Relationship between Production and Cost
3,37,The cost of producing anything depends on the amount of inputs or factors of production  these  terms are synonymous  and the input prices  Examples of factors of production are employee  hours machine hours raw materials and so on  For simplicity economists typically  concentrate on only two inputs labor and capital although obviously there can be many inputs  to a particular production process  The labor input is simply employee time and it is measured  as labor hours per time period such as per week or per month  We denote labor hours as L  If a  firm is using two laborers per week and each laborer works    hours per week then L equals     labor hours per week  We denote hours of capital as K  If the firm is using three machines and  each one is used for    hours per week then K equals    machine hours per week  That is the  capital input is measured as machine hours used per time period  In this way capital and labor  are stated in similar terms  They represent flows of services labor hours and machine  hours that are used to produce a flow of output per time period 
4,37,Accordingly the respective input prices would be the wage rate per labor hour  we use w to  denote wage rate  and the rental rate per machine hour  we use r to denote the rental rate per  machine hour   It is helpful to think of a firm as renting the services of labor and of machines   Although the firm might own its own machines it could in theory rent its machines out to  another user so it is forgoing the rate it could earn elsewhere when it is using its machines  internally instead of renting them out  So a firm is not using its own machines  for free   It is  incurring the opportunity cost of not being able to rent those machines to another user 
5,37,The total cost of production  TC  is the number of hours of labor multiplied by the wage rate  plus the number of machine hours multiplied by the rental rate of machines 
6,37,TC    w  L     r  K 
7,37,This formula illustrates that the total cost is just the cost of all the firm s inputs  It is not a cost  function however which is a relationship between the cost of production and the flow of  output  The cost function C   f Q  where  Q  denotes the flow of output in units of production  per time period relates the production cost per time period to the number of units of output  produced per time period 
8,37,Two things could cause the cost of producing any given level of output to fall  Either the price  of one or both inputs could fall or the inputs themselves could become more productive and less  of them would be needed  e g  a worker is more productive when fewer hours of labor are  needed to produce the same output   The reverse is true also  A rise in cost could result from  either a rise in input prices or a fall in input productivity or both 
9,37,Why is productivity important  Cost minimization and profit maximization behavior dictate  that the firm strives to maximize productivity for example produce the most output per unit  of input or produce any given level of output with the least amount of inputs  A firm that lags  behind the industry in productivity is at a competitive disadvantage and is likely to face  decreases in future earnings and shareholders  wealth  An increase in productivity lowers  production costs which leads to greater profitability and investment value  These productivity  benefits can be fully or partially distributed to other stakeholders of the business such as to  consumers in the form of lower prices and to employees in the form of enhanced compensation   Transferring some or all of the productivity rewards to non equity holders creates synergies that  benefit shareholders over time 
10,37,The benefits from increased productivity are as follows 
11,37,  lower business costs which translate into increased profitability

2,38,  an increase in the market value of equity and shareholders  wealth resulting from an  increase in profit  and
3,38,  an increase in worker rewards which motivates further productivity increases from labor 
4,38,Undoubtedly increases in productivity reinforce and strengthen the competitive position of the  firm over the long run  A fundamental analysis of a company should examine the firm s  commitment to productivity enhancements and the degree to which productivity is integrated  into the competitive nature of the industry or market  In some cases productivity is not only an  important promoter of growth in firm value over the long term but is also the key factor for  economic survival  A business that lags the market in terms of productivity often finds itself  less competitive while at the same time confronting profit erosion and deterioration in  shareholders  wealth  Typical productivity measures for a firm are based on the concepts of  total product average product and marginal product of labor 
5,38,       Total Average and Marginal Product of Labor
6,38,When measuring a firm s operating efficiency it is easier and more practical to use a single  resource factor as the input variable rather than a bundle of the different resources that the firm  uses in producing units of output  As discussed in the previous section labor is typically the  input that is the most identifiable and calculable for measuring productivity  However any  input that is not difficult to quantify can be used  As an example a business that manually  assembles widgets has    workers one production facility and an assortment of equipment and  hand tools  The firm would like to assess its productivity when using these three input factors to  produce widgets  In this example it is most appropriate to use labor as the input factor for  determining productivity because the firm uses only one  fixed  plant building and a variety of  other physical capital 
7,38,We will use labor as the input variable to illustrate the concepts of total product average  product and marginal product  Exhibit   provides a summary of these three concepts

2,39,Total product  Q  is defined as the aggregate sum of production for a firm during a time period   As a measure of productivity total product provides superficial information about how effective  and efficient a firm is in terms of producing output  For instance three firms Company A  Company B and Company C that make up an entire industry have total output levels of         units        units and        units respectively  Obviously Company C  dominates the market with a       share followed by Company B s       share and  Company A s       portion of the market  However this information says little about how  efficient each firm is in generating its total output level  Total product only provides insight into  a firm s production volume relative to the industry  it does not show how efficient a firm is in  producing its output 
3,39,Average product of labor  APL  measures the productivity of an input  in this case labor  on  average and is calculated by dividing total product by the total number of units for the given  input that is used to generate that output  Average product is usually measured on the basis of  the labor input  It is a representative or overall measure of labor s productivity  Some workers  are more productive than average and others are less productive than average 
4,39,Exhibit   compares the productivity of the three firms introduced earlier  Company A employs      worker hours and produces        widgets per hour  Company B employs     worker  hours and produces        widgets per hour  Company C employs     worker hours and  produces        widgets per hour

16,39,Using this metric it is apparent that Company A with APL equal to      is the most efficient  firm despite having the lowest market share  Company C has the largest market share but it is  the least efficient of the three with APL equal to      Assuming that Company A can maintain  its productivity advantage over the long run it will be positioned to generate the greatest return  on investment through lower costs and higher profit outcomes relative to the other firms in the  market 
17,39,Marginal product of labor  MPL  also known as marginal return measures the productivity of  each additional unit of input and is calculated by observing the difference in total product when  adding another unit of input  assuming other resource quantities are held constant   It is a gauge  of the productivity of the individual additional worker hour rather than an average across all  workers 
18,39,Exhibit   provides a numerical illustration for total average and marginal products of labor

7,40,Total product increases as the firm adds each additional hour of labor until the seventh labor  hour at which point total production declines by    units  Obviously the firm would want to  avoid negative worker productivity 
8,40,At an employment level of five labor hours APL is    units         and MPL is    units                         The average productivity for all five labor hours is    units but the productivity  of the fifth labor hour is only    units

7,41,Total product increases up to six machine hours where it tops out at       Because  total product declines from Hour   to Hour   the marginal product for Machine Hour    is negative     units  Average product peaks at      units with four machine hours   Average product increases at a steady pace with the addition of Machine Hours   and     The addition of Machine Hour   continues to increase average product but at a  decreasing rate  Beyond four machine hours average product decreases at an  increasing rate  Marginal product peaks with Machine Hour   and decreases thereafter 
8,41,Solution to   
9,41,The marginal product MPK of Machine Hour   is       The marginal product of each  additional machine hour beyond Machine Hour   declines  Diminishing marginal  returns are evident beyond Machine Hour   
10,41,A firm has a choice of using total product average product marginal product or some  combination of the three to measure productivity  Because total product is simply an indication  of a firm s output volume and potential market share average product and marginal product are  better gauges of a firm s productivity  Both can reveal competitive advantage through  production efficiency  However individual worker productivity is not easily measurable when  workers perform tasks collectively  In this case average product is the preferred measure of  productivity performance 
11,41,Referring to the total product column in Exhibit   output is more than twice as great       widgets  when two hours of labor are used as opposed to only one hour      widgets   In this  range of production there is an increase in return when employee hours are added to the  production process  This is the phenomenon of increasing marginal returns

2,42,     Breakeven and Shutdown Analysis
3,42,Two important considerations of any firm are its level of profitability and whether to continue  to operate in the current environment  Economists define profit differently than do accountants   Economic profit is defined as the difference between total revenue  TR  and total economic  costs  Accounting profit is the difference between TR and total accounting cost  TR is the  same from both an accounting standpoint and an economic standpoint  it is derived by  multiplying the selling price per unit of output by the number of units  TR    P  Q   The  difference between the two measures of profit therefore lies in an understanding of economic  cost  also called  opportunity cost  which is defined in detail in the next section  
4,42,       Economic Cost vs  Accounting Cost
5,42,The opportunity cost of any particular decision such as to produce a given level of output can  be determined by measuring the benefit forgone by not implementing the next best alternative   Suppose that a firm is currently operating with hired labor and its own plant and equipment to  produce output at some level  The firm must continuously decide either to keep the level of  output the same or to change it  The decision to maintain the same output requires that the firm  hire the same amount of labor input and use the same level of its capital inputs as before  The  labor expense is both an economic cost and an accounting cost because the money spent on  labor hours could have been used for something else  opportunity cost  and it is also a current  expense for the firm  accounting cost  
6,42,Accountants typically attempt to recognize the cost of plant and equipment in the form of  accounting depreciation which is a means of distributing the historical cost of the fixed capital  among the units of production for financial reporting purposes  The money spent in the past on  the firm s plant and equipment is what economists call a  sunk cost   Because sunk costs  cannot be altered they cannot affect an optimal decision which is forward looking  Sunk costs  are therefore ignored and the key management question is Going forward what are the  opportunity costs and benefits of maintaining a given level of output 
7,42,Here is where economic depreciation comes into play  To understand the opportunity costs of  using our plant and equipment already bought and paid for for one more period of time to  produce output we have to ask the question What else could be done with that fixed capital if it  were not used to produce our output  The answer might be that because there is no external  market for our machines and buildings we are forgoing nothing by using it to produce output   Or it might be that there is a market where we could rent out or sell our capital equipment  elsewhere instead of using it to produce output  That rental rate is the economic depreciation  associated with using our own equipment to produce output instead of renting or selling it  elsewhere 
8,42,Economic depreciation is forward looking  It asks What am I giving up if I use my resources to  produce output in the coming period  Accounting depreciation is backward looking  It asks  How should I distribute the historical cost that I have already paid across units of output that  I intend to produce this period  Both concepts are useful one for making managerial decisions  about output and the other as a way spreading historical costs for reporting or tax purposes but  there is not necessarily a direct relationship between the two

2,43,It is assumed that any for profit firm s management is tasked with achieving the goal of  shareholder wealth maximization  Put most simply that translates into the goal of economic  profit maximization  Hereafter when the word profit is used it will be economic profit that we  have in mind  Because profit is defined as TR minus TC anything that increases revenue more  than cost or decreases cost more than revenue will increase profit  Before we address profit  maximization we must introduce two important concepts  marginal revenue and marginal cost 
3,43,Marginal revenue  MR  is the additional revenue the firm realizes from the decision to  increase output by one unit per time period  That is MR    TR  Q  If the firm is operating in  what economists call a perfectly competitive market it is one of many sellers of identical  products in an environment characterized by low or non existent barriers to entry  Under perfect  competition the firm has no pricing power because there are many perfect substitutes for the  product it sells  If it were to attempt to raise the price even by a very small amount it would  lose all of its sales to competitors  On the other hand it can sell essentially any amount of  product it wants without lowering the price below the market price 
4,43,Take the wheat market as an example of a perfectly competitive market  A seller of wheat  would have no control over the market price of wheat  thus because TR    P  Q  MR for this  firm is simply price per unit of output  This firm is said to face a perfectly horizontal  zero  sloped  or infinitely elastic demand curve for its product  For example if the firm is selling       bushels of wheat per week at a price of    per bushel TR is        If the firm were to  increase its output by one unit then TR would rise by exactly    because the firm would not  have to lower its price to sell that added unit  So for sellers in a market with perfect  competition MR   P 
5,43,In contrast if a firm sells a product that is differentiated from other firms  products and that has  a large market share the firm is said to be operating in an environment of imperfect  competition  In the extreme case of imperfect competition there might be only one firm selling  a product with no close substitutes  That firm holds a monopoly and it is subject to the market  demand curve for its product  Whether a monopoly or simply operating under imperfect  competition the firm faces a negatively sloped demand curve and must lower its price to sell  another unit  Thus MR will be lower than price 
6,43,To illustrate this concept we will decompose MR  Recall from earlier in the reading that
7,43,TR    P  Q 
8,43,and
9,43,MR    TR  Q
10,43,Change in total revenue   TR  the numerator of the ratio can be written as  P   Q     Q   P  
11,43,There are two competing forces affecting revenue      Additional units are sold at the new  price and     all units must now be sold at the lower price  The firm is selling more units but it  is selling all units at a lower price than before 
12,43,To find MR we divide the change in TR by the change in quantity 
13,43,MR

2,44,Taking this one step further recall that earlier we said   P  Q  is the slope of the demand  curve  From our expression just given MR   P   Q  P  Q   so MR is equal to price with an  adjustment equal to quantity times the slope of the demand curve 
3,44,A perfectly competitive firm faces a demand curve with a slope of zero  Substituting   for   P  Q into the expression given it becomes clear that MR is equal to price for the perfectly  competitive firm it need not lower its price to sell an additional unit  For a firm in an  imperfectly competitive market however the demand curve is negatively sloped   P  Q        Substituting this negative number into the expression for MR P   Q  P  Q  it becomes clear  that MR for an imperfectly competitive firm is less than price 
4,44,Marginal cost  MC  is the increase to total cost resulting from the firm s decision to increase  output by one additional unit per time period  MC    TC  Q  Economists distinguish between  short run marginal cost  SMC  and long run marginal cost  LMC   Labor is variable over the  short run but the quantity of capital cannot be changed in the short run because there is a lead  time required to build or buy new plant equipment and put it in place  In the long run all inputs  are variable 
5,44,SMC is essentially the additional cost of the variable input labor that must be incurred to  increase the level of output by one unit  LMC is the additional cost of all inputs necessary to  increase the level of output allowing the firm the flexibility of changing both labor and capital  inputs in a way that maximizes efficiency 
6,44,Understanding MC is aided by recalling that cost is directly related to input prices and inversely related to productivity  For example if the wage rate were to rise cost would also rise  If labor  were to become more productive cost would fall  This relationship can be captured in an  expression that relates SMC to wage rate  w  and MPL  SMC   w MPL 
7,44,This relationship between cost and productivity also holds with average variable cost  Variable  costs are all costs that fluctuate with the level of production and sales  Average variable cost  AVC  is the ratio of total variable cost to total output  AVC   TVC Q  Again if labor s wage  rises AVC also rises  but if labor were to become more productive AVC falls  This  relationship is captured by the expression AVC   w APL 
8,44,Earlier we noted that over some range of low output the firm might benefit from increasing  marginal productivity of its labor input as workers begin to specialize  As the MPL increases  SMCs decline  Eventually as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital the  MPL must fall causing SMCs to rise 
9,44,We began this section by stating that the goal of management is to maximize profit  We now  address the conditions necessary for reaching that goal  Consider a firm currently producing       widgets each week and whose management is contemplating increasing that output  incrementally  Would that additional unit increase profit  Clearly profit would be increased  or  losses reduced  if the additional revenue from that next unit were greater than the additional  cost  So a profit seeking firm should increase Q if MR   MC  Conversely if the additional unit  added more to cost than to revenue the firm should reduce output because it would save more  in cost than it would lose in revenue  Only if the additional cost were exactly equal to the  additional revenue would the firm be maximizing its profit

2,45,There is another condition  called a second order condition  necessary for profit maximization   At the level of output at which MR   MC MC cannot be falling  This condition is fairly  intuitive  If MC is falling with additional output MPL would be rising   Recall that SMC    w MPL  If one additional hour of labor input causes MC to fall the firm would want to add that  hour and continue adding labor until SMC becomes positively sloped  We can sum up the  profit maximization decision for an operating firm as follows  Produce the level of output such  that     MR   MC and     MC is not falling 
3,45,       Understanding the Interaction between Total Variable Fixed and  Marginal Cost and Output
4,45,Exhibit    shows the graphical relationships between total cost total fixed cost and total  variable cost  TC is the summation of all costs where costs are classified on the basis of  whether they are fixed or variable  Total fixed cost  TFC  is the summation of all expenses  that do not change as the level of production varies  Total variable cost  TVC  is the  summation of all variable expenses  TVC rises with increased production and falls with  decreased production  At zero production TC is equal to TFC because TVC at this output level  is zero  The curve for TC always lies parallel to and above the TVC curve by the amount of  TFC

2,46,Exhibit    shows the relationships between the average total cost  ATC  average variable  cost  AVC  average fixed cost  AFC  and marginal cost  MC  curves in the short run  As  output quantity increases AFC declines because TFCs are spread over a larger number of units   Both ATC and AVC take on a bowl shaped pattern in which each curve initially declines  reaches a minimum average cost output level and then increases after that point  The MC curve  intersects both the ATC and the AVC at their minimum points points S and T  When MC is  less than AVC AVC will be decreasing  When MC is greater than AVC AVC will be  increasing

2,47,Exhibit    shows an example of how total average and marginal costs are derived  TC is  calculated by summing TFC and TVC  MC is derived by observing the change in TC as the  quantity variable changes  There is a relationship that always holds for average and marginal  costs  If MC is less than average cost average cost must fall and if MC is greater than average  cost average cost must rise  For example in Exhibit    AVC begins to increase as output rises  from   to   units because MC      is greater than AVC         Also from Exhibit    ATC  declines up to   units because MC is less than ATC  After   units ATC increases because the  MC of Unit        exceeds the ATC of all prior units       Initially the MC curve declines  because of increasing marginal returns to labor but at some point it begins to increase because  of the law of diminishing marginal returns

5,47,a Includes all opportunity costs 
6,47,As stated earlier TC increases as the firm expands output and decreases when production is cut   TC increases at a decreasing rate up to a certain output level  Thereafter the rate of increase  accelerates as the firm gets closer to full utilization of capacity  The rate of change in TC  mirrors the rate of change in TVC  In Exhibit    TC at   units is     of which     is variable  cost and     is fixed cost  At    units TC is      of which      is variable cost and     is  fixed cost 
7,47,Fixed costs typically are incurred whether the firm produces anything or not  Fixed costs may  stay the same over a given range of production but can change to another constant level when  production moves outside of that range  The latter is referred to as a quasi fixed cost  although it remains categorized as part of TFC  Examples of fixed costs are debt service real  estate lease agreements and rental contracts  Normal profit is also considered to be a fixed cost  because it is a return required by investors on their equity capital regardless of output level   Quasi fixed cost examples would be certain utilities and administrative salaries that could be  lower or avoided altogether when output is zero but would rise to higher constant levels over  different production ranges

2,48,Other fixed costs evolve primarily from investments in such fixed assets as real estate  production facilities and equipment  These fixed costs cannot be arbitrarily cut when  production declines  When a firm downsizes the last expense to be cut is usually fixed cost 
3,48,TVC has a direct relationship with quantity  When quantity increases TVC increases  when  quantity decreases TVC declines  At zero production TVC is always zero  Variable cost  examples are payments for labor raw materials and supplies  The change in TVC declines up  to a certain output point and then increases as production approaches capacity limits  In Exhibit     TVC increases with an increase in quantity  However the change from   to   units is               and the change from   to    units is

6,48,Dividing TFC by quantity yields AFC  AFC decreases throughout the production span  reflecting the spreading of a constant cost over more and more production units  At high  production volumes AFC may be so low that it is a small proportion of ATC  In Exhibit     AFC declines from     at   unit to    at   units and then to    at an output level of    units

2,49,In Exhibit    AVC at   units is             Over an initial range of production AVC declines  and then reaches a minimum point  Thereafter AVC increases as the firm uses more of its  production capacity  This higher cost results primarily from production constraints imposed by  the fixed assets at higher volume levels  The lowest AVC quantity does not correspond to the  least cost quantity for ATC because AFC is still declining  In Exhibit    AVC is minimized at    units whereas ATC is minimized at   units 
3,49,ATC is calculated by dividing TC by quantity  or by summing AFC and AVC   In Exhibit    at    units ATC is     TC of       units of production or AFC of        AVC of        This is the  least average cost point of production and the minimum point on the ATC curve  Although cost  minimizing behavior on the part of the firm would dictate operating at the minimum point on its  ATC curve the profit maximizing quantity may not correspond to this minimum ATC point   Profit per unit but not necessarily total profit is maximized at this point

2,50,Solution 
3,50,TFC remains unchanged at      throughout the entire production range whereas AFC  continuously declines from      at   unit to     at    units  Both AVC and MC  initially decline and then reach their lowest level at   units with costs of      and       respectively  Beyond   units both AVC and MC increase indicating that the cost  of production rises with greater output  The least cost point for ATC is      at   units   At zero output TC is      which equals the amount of TFC  at zero output the firm  will need no variable inputs but it is committed to its fixed plant and equipment in the  short run  
4,50,       Revenue under Conditions of Perfect and Imperfect Competition
5,50,Recall from our earlier discussion of profit maximizing conditions that a firm can generally be  classified as operating in either a perfectly competitive or an imperfectly competitive  environment  The difference between the two manifests itself in the slope of the demand curve  facing the firm  If the environment of the firm is perfectly competitive it must take the market  price of its output as given so it faces a perfectly elastic horizontal demand curve  In this case  as we saw previously the firm s MR and the price of its product are identical  Additionally the  firm s average revenue  AR  or revenue per unit is also equal to price per unit  However a  firm that faces a negatively sloped demand curve must lower its price to sell an additional unit  so its MR is less than price  P  
6,50,These characteristics of MR are also applicable to the TR functions  Under conditions of perfect  competition TR  as always  is equal to price times quantity  TR    P  Q   But under conditions  of perfect competition price is dictated by the market  the firm has no control over price  As the  firm sells one more unit its TR rises by the exact amount of price per unit 
7,50,Under conditions of imperfect competition price is a variable under the firm s control and  therefore price is a function of quantity  P   f Q  and TR   f Q    Q  For simplicity suppose  the firm is monopolistic and faces the market demand curve which we will assume is linear and  negatively sloped  Because the monopolist is the only seller its TR is identical to the total  expenditure of all buyers in the market  Earlier we noted what happens as price is reduced and  quantity sold increases in this environment  At first a decrease in price increases total  expenditure by buyers and TR to the firm because the decrease in price is outweighed by the  increase in units sold  But as price continues to fall the decrease in price overshadows the  increase in quantity and total expenditure  revenue  falls  We can now depict the demand and  TR functions for firms under conditions of perfect and imperfect competition as shown in

2,51,Panel A of Exhibit    depicts the demand curve  upper graph  and total revenue curve  lower  graph  for the firm under conditions of perfect competition  Notice that the vertical axis in the  upper graph is price per unit  e g    bushel  whereas TR is measured on the vertical axis in the  lower graph  e g    week   The same is true for the respective axes in Panel B which depicts  the demand and total revenue curves for the monopolist  The TR curve for the firm under  conditions of perfect competition is linear with a slope equal to price per unit  The TR curve  for the monopolist first rises  in the range where MR is positive and demand is elastic  and then  falls  in the range where MR is negative and demand is inelastic  with output

4,51,We can now combine the firm s short run TC curves with its TR curves to represent profit  maximization in the cases of perfect competition and imperfect competition  Exhibit    shows  both the AR and average cost curves in one graph for the firm under conditions of perfect  competition

2,52,The firm is maximizing profit by producing Q  where price is equal to SMC and SMC is  rising   Note that there is another output level Q  where P   SMC but at that point SMC is  still falling so this cannot be a profit maximizing solution   If market price were to rise the  firm s demand and MR curve would simply shift upward and the firm would reach a new  profit maximizing output level to the right of Q   If on the other hand market price were to  fall the firm s demand and MR curve would shift downward resulting in a new and lower level  of profit maximizing output  As depicted this firm is currently earning a positive economic  profit because market price exceeds ATC at output level Q   This profit is possible in the short  run but in the long run competitors would enter the market to capture some of those profits and  would drive the market price down to a level equal to each firm s ATC 
3,52,Exhibit    depicts the cost and revenue curves for the monopolist that is facing a negatively  sloped market demand curve  The MR and demand curves are not identical for this firm  But the  profit maximizing rule is still the same  Find the level of Q that equates SMC to MR in this  case Q   Once that level of output is determined the optimal price to charge is given by the  firm s demand curve at P   This monopolist is earning positive economic profit because its  price exceeds its ATC  The barriers to entry that give this firm its monopolistic power mean that  outside competitors would be unable to compete away this firm s profits

3,53,       Breakeven Analysis
4,53,A firm is said to break even if its TR is equal to its TC  It can also be said that a firm breaks  even if its price  AR  is exactly equal to its ATC which is true under conditions of perfect and  imperfect competition  Of course the goal of management is not just to break even but to  maximize profit  However perhaps the best the firm can do is cover all of its economic costs   Economic costs are the sum of total accounting costs and implicit opportunity costs  A firm  whose revenue is equal to its economic costs is covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors  of production including capital  Economists would say that such a firm is earning normal  profit but not positive economic profit  It is earning a rate of return on capital just equal to the  rate of return that an investor could expect to earn in an equivalently risky alternative  investment  opportunity cost   Firms that are operating in a very competitive environment with  no barriers to entry from other competitors can expect in the long run to be unable to earn a  positive economic profit  the excess rate of return would attract entrants who would produce  more output and ultimately drive the market price down to the level at which each firm is at best  just earning a normal profit  This situation of course does not imply that the firm is earning  zero accounting profit 
5,53,Exhibit    depicts the condition for both a firm under conditions of perfect competition  Panel  A  and a monopolist  Panel B  in which the best each firm can do is to break even  Note that at  the level of output at which SMC is equal to MR price is just equal to ATC  Hence economic  profit is zero and the firms are breaking even

2,55,       The Shutdown Decision
3,55,In the long run if a firm cannot earn at least a zero economic profit it will not operate because  it is not covering the opportunity cost of all of its factors of production labor and capital  In the  short run however a firm might find it advantageous to continue to operate even if it is not  earning at least a zero economic profit  The discussion that follows addresses the decision to  continue to operate and earn negative profit or shut down operations 
4,55,Recall that typically some or all of a firm s fixed costs are incurred regardless of whether the  firm operates  The firm might have a lease on its building that it cannot avoid paying until the  lease expires  In that case the lease payment is a sunk cost  It cannot be avoided no matter  what the firm does  Sunk costs must be ignored in the decision to continue to operate in the  short run  As long as the firm s revenues cover at least its variable cost the firm is better off  continuing to operate  If price is greater than AVC the firm is not only covering all of its  variable cost but also a portion of fixed cost 
5,55,For example suppose a firm is producing     widgets and selling them at a price of    each   Obviously its TR is      per time period  Suppose also that at that level of output its ATC is     made up of AVC of       plus AFC of       per period  This firm is said to be earning  negative economic profit  also referred to as economic loss a condition in which revenues  fall short of total opportunity cost  of      because its TC is      and its TR is only        Should this firm shut down immediately  If the fixed cost is unavoidable then the firm is  obligated to pay it whether it operates or not  The TFC is             per unit on     units   If  it shuts down and earns zero revenue then its variable cost would be zero but its losses would  still equal the      of unavoidable fixed cost  If however it continued to operate it could earn  revenue of      that would cover its variable cost of      and contribute     toward the fixed  costs  In other words this firm would lose less by continuing to operate        than by shutting  down        
6,55,In the long run unless market price increases this firm would exit the industry  But in the short  run it will continue to operate at a loss  Exhibit    depicts a firm under conditions of perfect  competition facing three alternative market price ranges for its output  At any price above P   the firm can earn a positive profit and clearly should continue to operate  At a price below P   the minimum AVC the firm could not even cover its variable cost and should shut down  At  prices between P  and P  the firm should continue to operate in the short run because it is able  to cover all of its variable cost and contribute something toward unavoidable fixed costs   Economists refer to the minimum AVC point as the shutdown point and the minimum ATC  point as the breakeven point

13,58,In the short run the firm is able to cover all of its TVC but only half of its    million in  TFC  If the business ceases to operate its loss would be    million the amount of TFC  whereas the net loss by operating would be minimized at          The firm should  attempt to operate by negotiating special arrangements with creditors to buy time to  return operations back to profitability

2,59,Solution to   
3,59,If the revenue shortfall is expected to persist over time the firm should cease operations  liquidate assets and pay debts to the extent possible  Any residual for shareholders  would decrease the longer the firm is allowed to operate unprofitably 
4,59,Solution to   
5,59,The firm would minimize loss at    million of TFC by shutting down  If the firm  decided to continue to do business the loss would increase to      million  Shareholders  would save         in equity value by pursuing this option  Unquestionably the  business would have a rather short life expectancy if this loss situation were to continue 
6,59,When evaluating profitability particularly of start up firms and businesses using turnaround  strategies analysts should consider highlighting breakeven and shutdown points in their  financial research  Identifying the unit sales levels at which the firm enters or leaves the  production range for profitability and at which the firm can no longer function as a viable  business entity provides invaluable insight for investment decisions 
7,59,     Understanding Economies and Diseconomies of Scale
8,59,Rational behavior dictates that the firm select an operating size or scale that maximizes profit  over any time frame  The time frame that defines the short run and long run for any firm is  based on the ability of the firm to adjust the quantities of the fixed resources it uses  The short  run is the time period during which at least one of the factors of production such as technology  physical capital and plant size is fixed  The long run is defined as the time period during which  all factors of production are variable  Additionally in the long run firms can enter or exit the  market based on decisions regarding profitability  The long run is often referred to as the   planning horizon  in which the firm can choose the short run position or optimal operating  size that maximizes profit over time  The firm is always operating in the short run but planning  in the long run 
9,59,The time required for long run adjustments varies by industry  For example the long run for a  small business using very little technology and physical capital may be less than a year whereas  for a capital intensive firm the long run may be more than a decade  Given enough time  however all production factors are variable which allows the firm to choose an operating size  or plant capacity based on different technologies and physical capital  In this regard costs and  profits will differ between the short run and the long run 
10,59,       Short  and Long Run Cost Curves
11,59,Recall that when we addressed the short run cost curves of the firm we assumed that the capital  input was held constant  That meant that the only way to vary output in the short run is to  change the level of the variable input in our case labor  If the capital input namely plant  and equipment were to change however we would have an entirely new set of short run cost  curves one for each level of capital input

2,60,The short run total cost includes all the inputs labor and capital the firm is using to produce  output  For reasons discussed earlier the typical short run total cost  STC  curve might rise  with output first at a decreasing rate because of specialization economies and then at an  increasing rate reflecting the law of diminishing marginal returns to labor  Total fixed cost  the  quantity of capital input multiplied by the rental rate on capital  determines the vertical intercept  of the STC curve  At higher levels of fixed input TFC is greater but the production capacity of  the firm is also greater  Exhibit    shows three different STC curves for the same technology  but using three distinct levels of capital input Points     and   on the vertical axis

2,61,Plant Size   is the smallest and of course has the lowest fixed cost  hence its STC  curve has  the lowest vertical intercept  But note that STC  begins to rise more steeply with output  reflecting the lower plant capacity  Plant Size   is the largest of the three and reflects that size  with both a higher fixed cost and a lower slope at any level of output  If a firm decided to  produce an output between zero and Qa it would plan on building Plant Size   because for any  output level in that range its cost is less than it would be for Plant Size   or    Accordingly if  the firm were planning to produce output greater than Qb it would choose Plant Size   because  its cost for any of those levels of output would be lower than for Plant Size   or    And of  course Plant Size   would be chosen for output levels between Qa and Qb  The long run total  cost curve is derived from the lowest level of STC for each level of output because in the long  run the firm is free to choose which plant size it will operate  This curve is called an  envelope  curve   In essence this curve envelopes encompasses all possible combinations of  technology plant size and physical capital 
3,61,For each STC curve there is also a corresponding short run average total cost  SATC   curve and a corresponding long run average total cost  LRAC  curve the envelope curve of  all possible short run average total cost curves  The shape of the LRAC curve reflects an
4,61,important concept called economies of scale and diseconomies of scale 
5,61,       Defining Economies of Scale and Diseconomies of Scale
6,61,When a firm increases all of its inputs in order to increase its level of output  obviously a long  run concept  it is said to scale up its production  Scaling down is the reverse decreasing all of  its inputs in order to produce less in the long run  Economies of scale occur if as the firm  increases its output cost per unit of production falls  Graphically this definition translates into  a LRAC curve with a negative slope  Exhibit    depicts several SATC curves one for each  plant size and the LRAC curve representing economies of scale

2,62,Diseconomies of scale occur if cost per unit rises as output increases  Graphically  diseconomies of scale translate into an LRAC curve with a positive slope  Exhibit    depicts  several SATC curves one for each plant size and their envelope curve the LRAC curve  representing diseconomies of scale 
3,62,Exhibit     Short run Average Total Cost Curves for Various Plant Sizes and  Their Envelope Curve LRAC  Diseconomies of Scale
4,62,As the firm grows in size economies of scale and a lower ATC can result from the following  factors 
5,62,  Increasing returns to scale which is when a production process allows for increases  in output that are proportionately larger than the increase in inputs 
6,62,  Having a division of labor and management in a large firm with numerous workers  which allows each worker to specialize in one task rather than perform many duties as in  the case of a small business  as such workers in a large firm become more proficient at  their jobs  
7,62,  Being able to afford more expensive yet more efficient equipment and to adapt the latest  in technology that increases productivity 
8,62,  Effectively reducing waste and lowering costs through marketable byproducts less  energy consumption and enhanced quality control 
9,62,  Making better use of market information and knowledge for more effective managerial  decision making

2,63,A classic example of a business that realizes economies of scale through greater physical capital  investment is an electric utility  By expanding output capacity to accommodate a larger  customer base the utility company s per unit cost will decline  Economies of scale help explain  why electric utilities have naturally evolved from localized entities to regional and multi region  enterprises  Wal Mart is an example of a business that uses bulk purchasing power to obtain  deep discounts from suppliers to keep costs and prices low  Wal Mart also uses the latest  technology to monitor point of sale transactions to gather timely market information to respond  to changes in customer buying behavior which leads to economies of scale through lower  distribution and inventory costs 
3,63,The factors that can lead to diseconomies of scale inefficiencies and rising costs when a firm  increases in size include the following 
4,63,  Decreasing returns to scale which is when a production process leads to increases in  output that are proportionately smaller than the increase in inputs 
5,63,  Being so large that it cannot be properly managed 
6,63,  Overlapping and duplication of business functions and product lines 
7,63,  Higher resource prices because of supply constraints when buying inputs in large  quantities 
8,63,Before its restructuring General Motors  GM  was an example of a business that had realized  diseconomies of scale by becoming too large  Scale diseconomies occurred through product  overlap and duplication  i e  similar or identical automobile models  and the fixed cost for  these models was not spread over a large volume of output   Recently the company has decided  to discontinue various low volume product models that overlapped with other models   GM had  numerous manufacturing plants throughout the world and sold vehicles in more than a hundred  countries  Given this geographical dispersion in production and sales the company had  communication and management coordination problems which resulted in higher costs  Also  GM had significantly higher labor costs than its competitors  As the largest producer in the  market it had been a target of labor unions for higher compensation and benefits packages  relative to other firms 
9,63,Economies and diseconomies of scale can occur at the same time  the impact on long run  average total cost  LRAC  depends on which dominates  If economies of scale dominate  LRAC decreases with increases in output  The reverse holds true when diseconomies of scale  prevail  There may be a range of output over which LRAC falls  economies of scale  and then a  range over which LRAC might be constant followed by a range over which diseconomies of  scale prevail as depicted in Exhibit    
10,63,The minimum point on the LRAC curve is referred to as the minimum efficient scale  The  minimum efficient scale is the optimal firm size under perfect competition over the long run   Theoretically perfect competition forces the firm to operate at the minimum point on the LRAC  curve because the market price will be established at this level over the long run  If the firm is  not operating at this least cost point its long term viability will be threatened

2,65,Solution 
3,65,First it is observable that the foreign auto companies have a lower LRAC compared  with that of the US automobile manufacturers  This competitive position places the US  firms at a cost and possibly pricing disadvantage in the market with the potential to  lose market share to the lower cost foreign competitors  Second only Rocket operates at  the minimum point of the LRACUS whereas GenAuto is situated in the region of  diseconomies of scale and Starr is positioned in the economies of scale portion of the  curve  To become more efficient and competitive GenAuto needs to downsize and  restructure which means moving down the LRACUS curve to a smaller yet lower cost  production volume  In Contrast Starr has to grow in size to become more efficient and  competitive by lowering per unit costs 
4,65,From a long term investment prospective and given its cost advantage Rocket has the  potential to create more investment value relative to GenAuto and Starr  Over the long  run if GenAuto and Starr can lower their ATC they will become more attractive to  investors  But if any of the three US auto companies cannot match the cost  competitiveness of the foreign firms they may be driven from the market  In the long  run the lower cost foreign automakers pose a severe competitive challenge to the  survival of the US manufacturers and their ability to maintain and grow shareholders   wealth 
5,65,SUMMARY
6,65,This reading addressed several important concepts that extend the basic market model of  demand and supply to assist the analyst in assessing a firm s breakeven and shutdown points of  production  Demand concepts covered include own price elasticity of demand cross price  elasticity of demand and income elasticity of demand  Supply concepts covered include total  average and marginal product of labor  total variable and marginal cost of labor  and total and  marginal revenue  These concepts are used to calculate the breakeven and shutdown points of  production 
7,65,  Elasticity of demand is a measure of how sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in  various variables 
8,65,  Own price elasticity of demand is the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to  percentage change in a good or service s own price 
9,65,  If own price elasticity of demand is greater than one in absolute terms demand is elastic  and a decline in price will result in higher total expenditure on that good 
10,65,  If own price elasticity of demand is less than one in absolute terms demand is inelastic  and a decline in price will result in a lower total expenditure on that good 
11,65,  If own price elasticity of demand is equal to negative one demand is unit or unitary  elastic and total expenditure on that good is independent of price

2,66,  Own price elasticity of demand will almost always be negative 
3,66,  Income elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to  the percentage change in consumer income 
4,66,  Demand is negatively sloped because of either the substitution effect or the income effect 
5,66,  The substitution effect is the phenomenon in which as a good s price falls more of this  good is substituted for other more expensive goods 
6,66,  The income effect is the phenomenon in which as a good s price falls real income rises  and if this good is normal more of it will be purchased 
7,66,  If the good is inferior the income effect will partially or fully offset the substitution  effect 
8,66,  There are two exceptions to the law of demand  Giffen goods and Veblen goods 
9,66,  Giffen goods are highly inferior and make up a large portion of the consumer budget  As  price falls the substitution effect tends to cause more of the good to be consumed but the  highly negative income effect overwhelms the substitution effect  Demand curves for  Giffen goods are positively sloped 
10,66,  Veblen goods are highly valued high priced  status  goods  consumers may tend to buy  more of a good if its price rises 
11,66,  If income elasticity of demand is positive the good is a normal good  If income elasticity  of demand is negative the good is an inferior good 
12,66,  Cross price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity  demanded of one good to the percentage change in the price of a related good 
13,66,  If cross price elasticity between two goods is positive they are substitutes and if cross  price elasticity between two goods is negative they are complements 
14,66,  The law of demand states that a decrease in price will cause an increase in quantity  demanded 
15,66,  Total product of labor is a short run concept that is the total quantity that is able to be  produced for each level of labor input holding all other inputs constant 
16,66,  Average product of labor  APL  is the total product of labor divided by number of labor  hours 
17,66,  Marginal product of labor  MPL  is the change in total product divided by the change in  labor hours  MPL might rise as more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital 
18,66,  The law of diminishing returns dictates that additional output must fall as more and more  labor is added to a fixed amount of capital 
19,66,  Production costs increase as input prices rise and fall as inputs become more productive

2,67,  Short run total cost  STC  is the total expenditure on fixed capital plus the total  expenditure on labor 
3,67,  Short run marginal cost  SMC  equals the ratio of wage to marginal product of labor   MPL  
4,67,  Average variable cost  AVC  is the ratio of wage to average product of labor  APL  
5,67,  Average total cost  ATC  is total cost  TC  divided by the number of units produced 
6,67,  Revenue is price times quantity sold 
7,67,  Marginal revenue  MR  is the ratio of change in revenue to change in output 
8,67,  Firms under conditions of perfect competition have no pricing power and therefore face  a perfectly horizontal demand curve at the market price  For firms under conditions of  perfect competition price is identical to marginal revenue  MR  
9,67,  Firms under conditions of imperfect competition face a negatively sloped demand curve  and have pricing power  For firms under conditions of imperfect competition marginal  revenue  MR  is less than price 
10,67,  Economic profit equals total revenue  TR  minus total economic cost whereas  accounting profit equals TR minus total accounting cost 
11,67,  Economic cost takes into account the total opportunity cost of all factors of production 
12,67,  Opportunity cost is the next best alternative forgone in making a decision 
13,67,  Maximum economic profit requires that     marginal revenue  MR  equals marginal cost   MC  and     MC not be falling with output 
14,67,  The breakeven point occurs when total revenue  TR  equals total cost  TC  otherwise  stated as the output quantity at which average total cost  ATC  equals price 
15,67,  Shutdown occurs when a firm is better off not operating than continuing to operate 
16,67,  If all fixed costs are sunk costs then shutdown occurs when the market price falls below  minimum average variable cost  After shutdown the firm incurs only fixed costs and  loses less money than it would operating at a price that does not cover variable costs 
17,67,  In the short run it may be rational for a firm to continue to operate while earning negative  economic profit if some unavoidable fixed costs are covered 
18,67,  Economies of scale is defined as decreasing long run cost per unit as output increases   Diseconomies of scale is defined as increasing long run cost per unit as output increases 
19,67,  Long run average total cost is the cost of production per unit of output under conditions  in which all inputs are variable 
20,67,  Specialization efficiencies and bargaining power in input price can lead to economies of  scale

10,76,   B is correct  Price elasticity of demand is likely to be greater for items that are seen as  optional or discretionary 
11,76,   B is correct  Income elasticity is a measure of how sensitive quantity demanded is to a  change in income  If the income elasticity of demand for the product is      whenever  income increases by    the quantity demanded of the product at each price decreases by        Consequently as income rises consumers will purchase less of the product

36,77,    A is correct  In the case of normal goods the income and substitution effects are  reinforcing leading to an increase in the amount purchased after a drop in price 
37,77,    A is correct  The income effect overwhelms the substitution effect such that an increase  in the price of the good results in greater demand for the good resulting in a positively  sloped demand curve

2,78,    A is correct  Normal profit is the level of accounting profit such that implicit opportunity  costs are just covered  thus it is equal to a level of accounting profit such that economic  profit is zero 
3,78,    A is correct  The law of diminishing returns occurs in the short run when additional  output falls as more and more labor is added to a fixed amount of capital  When a factory  is operating at full capacity adding additional employees will not increase production  because the physical plant is already      employed  More labor hours will add to costs  without adding to output thus resulting in diminishing marginal returns 
4,78,    A is correct  Diminishing marginal returns occur when the marginal product of a resource  decreases as additional units of that input are employed  Marginal product which is the  additional output resulting from using one more unit of input is presented below 
5,78,Machine Hours Total Product Average Product Marginal Product                                                          
6,78,The marginal product of the third machine hour is   and declines thereafter   Consequently diminishing marginal returns are first evident beyond three machine hours 
7,78,    A is correct  Marginal revenue per unit is defined as the change in total revenue divided  by the change in quantity sold  MR    TR    Q  In this case change in total revenue  equals CHF       and change in total units sold equals     CHF               CHF     
8,78,    A is correct  In a perfectly competitive market an increase in supply by a single firm will  not affect price  Therefore an increase in units sold by the firm will be matched  proportionately by an increase in revenue 
9,78,    A is correct  Marginal revenue per unit is defined as the change in total revenues divided  by the change in quantity sold  MR    TR    Q  In this case change in total revenue per  day equals                                   and change in units sold equals                                     
10,78,    A is correct  Under perfect competition a firm is a price taker at any quantity supplied to  the market and AR   MR   Price 
11,78,    A is correct  Average fixed cost is equal to total fixed cost divided by quantity produced   AFC   TFC Q              
12,78,    C is correct  Marginal cost is equal to the change in total cost divided by the change in  quantity produced  MC    TC  Q             
13,78,    C is correct  Average total cost is equal to total cost divided by quantity produced  At    units produced the average total cost is      ATC   TC Q               
14,78,    A is correct  Under perfect competition price equals marginal revenue  A firm breaks  even when marginal revenue equals average total cost

2,79,    C is correct  The firm should shut down production when marginal revenue is less than  average variable cost 
3,79,    A is correct  A company is said to break even if its total revenue is equal to its total cost   Under conditions of perfect competition a company will break even when market price is  equal to the minimum point of the average total cost curve 
4,79,    B is correct  A company will shut down production in the short run when total revenue is  below total variable costs 
5,79,    C is correct  A company will stay in the market in the long term if total revenue is equal  to or greater than total cost  Because total costs are    million     million variable costs  and    million fixed costs  the company will stay in the market in the long term if total  revenue equals at least    million 
6,79,    B is correct  When total revenue is enough to cover variable costs but not total fixed costs  in full the firm can survive in the short run but would be unable to maintain financial  solvency in the long run 
7,79,    A is correct  The quantity at which average total cost is minimized does not necessarily  correspond to a profit maximum 
8,79,    C is correct  Output increases in the same proportion as input increases occur at constant  returns to scale 
9,79,    B is correct  Economies of scale occur if as the firm increases output cost per unit of  production falls  Graphically this definition translates into a long run average cost curve   LRAC  with a negative slope 
10,79,    B is correct  As the firm increases output diseconomies of scale and higher average total  costs can result when there is overlap and duplication of business functions and product  lines 
11,79,    C is correct  The firm operating at greater than long run efficient scale is subject to  diseconomies of scale  It should plan to decrease its level of production 
12,79,    A is correct  Competition should drive prices down to long run marginal cost resulting in  only normal profits being earned 
13,79,    A is correct  Three workers produce the highest average product equal to      AP                
14,79,    B is correct  Marginal product is equal to the change in total product divided by the  change in labor  The increase in MP from   to   workers is      MP    TP  L                                      
15,79,NOTES
16,79, Following usual practice we show linear demand curves intersecting the quantity axis at a price of zero  Real  world demand functions may be non linear in some or all parts of their domain  Thus linear demand functions in  practical cases are approximations of the true demand function that are useful for a relevant range of values

2,82,   INTRODUCTION
3,82,The purpose of this reading is to build an understanding of the importance of market structure   As different market structures result in different sets of choices facing a firm s decision makers  an understanding of market structure is a powerful tool in analyzing issues such as a firm s  pricing of its products and more broadly its potential to increase profitability  In the long run a  firm s profitability will be determined by the forces associated with the market structure within  which it operates  In a highly competitive market long run profits will be driven down by the  forces of competition  In less competitive markets large profits are possible even in the long  run  in the short run any outcome is possible  Therefore understanding the forces behind the  market structure will aid the financial analyst in determining firms  short  and long term  prospects 
4,82,Section   introduces the analysis of market structures  The section addresses questions such as   What determines the degree of competition associated with each market structure  Given the  degree of competition associated with each market structure what decisions are left to the  management team developing corporate strategy  How does a chosen pricing and output  strategy evolve into specific decisions that affect the profitability of the firm  The answers to  these questions are related to the forces of the market structure within which the firm operates 
5,82,Sections       and   analyze demand supply optimal price and output and factors affecting  long run equilibrium for perfect competition monopolistic competition oligopoly and pure  monopoly respectively 
6,82,Section   reviews techniques for identifying the various forms of market structure  For  example there are accepted measures of market concentration that are used by regulators of  financial institutions to judge whether or not a planned merger or acquisition will harm the  competitive nature of regional banking markets  Financial analysts should be able to identify the  type of market structure a firm is operating within  Each different structure implies a different  long run sustainability of profits  A summary and practice problems conclude the reading 
7,82,   ANALYSIS OF MARKET STRUCTURES
8,82,Traditionally economists classify a market into one of four structures  perfect competition  monopolistic competition oligopoly and monopoly  Section     explains that four way  classification in more detail  Section     completes the introduction by providing and explaining  the major points to evaluate in determining the structure to which a market belongs

2,83,     Economists  Four Types of Structure
3,83,Economists define a market as a group of buyers and sellers that are aware of each other and are  able to agree on a price for the exchange of goods and services  While the internet has extended  a number of markets worldwide certain markets are limited by geographic boundaries  For  example the internet search engine Google operates in a worldwide market  In contrast the  market for premixed cement is limited to the area within which a truck can deliver the mushy  mix from the plant to a construction site before the compound becomes useless  Thomas L   Friedman s international best seller The World Is Flat  challenges the concept of the geographic  limitations of the market  If the service being provided by the seller can be digitized its market  expands worldwide  For example a technician can scan your injury in a clinic in Switzerland   That radiographic image can be digitized and sent to a radiologist in India to be read  As a  customer  i e  patient  you may never know that part of the medical service provided to you  was the result of a worldwide market 
4,83,Some markets are highly concentrated with the majority of total sales coming from a small  number of firms  For example in the market for small consumer batteries three firms  controlled    percent of the US market  Duracell    percent Energizer    percent and  Rayovac    percent  as of       Other markets are very fragmented such as automobile  repairs where small independent shops often dominate and large chains may or may not exist   New products can lead to market concentration  It is estimated that the Apple iPod had a world  market share of over    percent among MP  players in      
5,83,THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKET STRUCTURE
6,83,Consider the evolution of television broadcasting  As the market environment for  television broadcasting evolved the market structure changed resulting in a new set of  challenges and choices  In the early days there was only one choice  the  free  analog  channels that were broadcast over the airwaves  In most countries there was only one  channel owned and run by the government  In the United States some of the more  populated markets were able to receive more channels because local channels were set  up to cover a market with more potential viewers  By the     s new technologies made  it possible to broadcast by way of cable connectivity and the choices offered to  consumers began to expand rapidly  Cable television challenged the  free  broadcast  channels by offering more choice and a better quality picture  The innovation was  expensive for consumers and profitable for the cable companies  By the     s a new  alternative began to challenge the existing broadcast and cable systems  satellite  television  Satellite providers offered a further expanded set of choices albeit at a higher  price than the free broadcast and cable alternatives  In the early     s satellite  television providers lowered their pricing to compete directly with the cable providers   Today cable program providers satellite television providers and terrestrial digital  broadcasters that offer premium and pay per view channels compete for customers who  are increasingly finding content on the internet 
7,83,This is a simple illustration of the importance of market structure  As the market for  television broadcasting became increasingly competitive managers had to make  decisions regarding product packaging pricing advertising and marketing in order to  survive in the changing environment

2,84,Market structure can be broken down into four distinct categories  perfect competition  monopolistic competition oligopoly and monopoly 
3,84,We start with the most competitive environment perfect competition  Unlike some economic  concepts perfect competition is not merely an ideal based on assumptions  Perfect competition  is a reality for example in several commodities markets where sellers and buyers have a  strictly homogeneous product and no single producer is large enough to influence market prices   Perfect competition s characteristics are well recognized and its long run outcome unavoidable   Profits under the conditions of perfect competition are driven to the required rate of return paid  by the entrepreneur to borrow capital from investors  so called normal profit or rental cost of  capital   This does not mean that all perfectly competitive industries are doomed to extinction  by a lack of profits  On the contrary millions of businesses that do very well are living under  the pressures of perfect competition 
4,84,Monopolistic competition is also highly competitive  however it is considered a form of  imperfect competition  Two economists Edward H  Chamberlin  US  and Joan Robinson  UK   identified this hybrid market and came up with the term because there are strong elements of  competition in this market structure and also some monopoly like conditions  The competitive  characteristic is a notably large number of firms while the monopoly aspect is the result of  product differentiation  That is if the seller can convince consumers that its product is uniquely  different from other similar products then the seller can exercise some degree of pricing power  over the market  A good example is the brand loyalty associated with soft drinks such as Coca  Cola  Many of Coca Cola s customers believe that their beverages are truly different from and  better than all other soft drinks  The same is true for fashion creations and cosmetics 
5,84,The oligopoly market structure is based on a relatively small number of firms supplying the  market  The small number of firms in the market means that each firm must consider what  retaliatory strategies the other firms will pursue when prices and production levels change   Consider the pricing behavior of commercial airline companies  Pricing strategies and route  scheduling are based on the expected reaction of the other carriers in similar markets  For any  given route say from Paris France to Chennai India only a few carriers are in competition   If one of the carriers changes its pricing package others will likely retaliate  Understanding the  market structure of oligopoly markets can help in identifying a logical pattern of strategic price  changes for the competing firms 
6,84,Finally the least competitive market structure is monopoly  In pure monopoly markets there  are no other good substitutes for the given product or service  There is a single seller which if  allowed to operate without constraint exercises considerable power over pricing and output  decisions  In most market based economies around the globe pure monopolies are regulated by  a governmental authority  The most common example of a regulated monopoly is the local  electrical power provider  In most cases the monopoly power provider is allowed to earn a  normal return on its investment and prices are set by the regulatory authority to allow that  return 
7,84,     Factors That Determine Market Structure
8,84,Five factors determine market structure 
9,84,   The number and relative size of firms supplying the product 
10,84,   The degree of product differentiation 
11,84,http   e pub t fd gahj vcl b y    vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print            x

2,85,   The power of the seller over pricing decisions 
3,85,   The relative strength of the barriers to market entry and exit  and
4,85,   The degree of non price competition 
5,85,The number and relative size of firms in a market influence market structure  If there are many  firms the degree of competition increases  With fewer firms supplying a good or service  consumers are limited in their market choices  One extreme case is the monopoly market  structure with only one firm supplying a unique good or service  Another extreme is perfect  competition with many firms supplying a similar product  Finally an example of relative size  is the automobile industry in which a small number of large international producers  e g  Ford  and Toyota  are the leaders in the global market and a number of small companies either have  market power because they are niche players  e g  Ferrari  or have little market power because  of their narrow range of models or limited geographical presence  e g   koda  
6,85,In the case of monopolistic competition there are many firms providing products to the market  as with perfect competition  However one firm s product is differentiated in some way that  makes it appear better than similar products from other firms  If a firm is successful in  differentiating its product the differentiation will provide pricing leverage  The more dissimilar  the product appears the more the market will resemble the monopoly market structure  A firm  can differentiate its product through aggressive advertising campaigns  frequent styling  changes  the linking of its product with other complementary products  or a host of other  methods 
7,85,When the market dictates the price based on aggregate supply and demand conditions the  individual firm has no control over pricing  The typical hog farmer in Nebraska and the milk  producer in Bavaria are price takers  That is they must accept whatever price the market  dictates  This is the case under the market structure of perfect competition  In the case of  monopolistic competition the success of product differentiation determines the degree with  which the firm can influence price  In the case of oligopoly there are so few firms in the market  that price control becomes possible  However the small number of firms in an oligopoly market  invites complex pricing strategies  Collusion price leadership by dominant firms and other  pricing strategies can result 
8,85,The degree to which one market structure can evolve into another and the difference between  potential short run outcomes and long run equilibrium conditions depend on the strength of the  barriers to entry and the possibility that firms fail to recoup their original costs or lose money  for an extended period of time and are therefore forced to exit the market  Barriers to entry can  result from very large capital investment requirements as in the case of petroleum refining   Barriers may also result from patents as in the case of some electronic products and drug  formulas  Another entry consideration is the possibility of high exit costs  For example plants  that are specific to a special line of products such as aluminum smelting plants are non  redeployable and exit costs would be high without a liquid market for the firm s assets  High  exit costs deter entry and are therefore also considered barriers to entry  In the case of farming  the barriers to entry are low  Production of corn soybeans wheat tomatoes and other produce  is an easy process to replicate  therefore those are highly competitive markets

2,86,Non price competition dominates those market structures where product differentiation is  critical  Therefore monopolistic competition relies on competitive strategies that may not  include pricing changes  An example of non price competition is product differentiation  through marketing  In other circumstances non price competition may occur because the few  firms in the market feel dependent on each other  Each firm fears retaliatory price changes that  would reduce total revenue for all of the firms in the market  Because oligopoly industries have  so few firms each firm feels dependent on the pricing strategies of the others  Therefore non  price competition becomes a dominant strategy

21,86,From the perspective of the owners of the firm the most desirable market structure is that with  the most control over price because this control can lead to large profits  Monopoly and  oligopoly markets offer the greatest potential control over price  monopolistic competition  offers less control  Firms operating under perfectly competitive market conditions have no  control over price  From the consumers  perspective the most desirable market structure is that  with the greatest degree of competition because prices are generally lower  Thus consumers  would prefer as many goods and services as possible to be offered in competitive markets 
22,86,As often happens in economics there is a trade off  While perfect competition gives the largest  quantity of a good at the lowest price other market forms may spur more innovation   Specifically there may be high costs in researching a new product and firms will incur such  costs only if they expect to earn an attractive return on their research investment  This is the  case often made for medical innovations for example the cost of clinical trials and  experiments to create new medicines would bankrupt perfectly competitive firms but may be  acceptable in an oligopoly market structure  Therefore consumers can benefit from less than  perfectly competitive markets

2,87,PORTER S FIVE FORCES AND MARKET STRUCTURE
3,87,A financial analyst aiming to establish market conditions and consequent profitability of  incumbent firms should start with the questions framed by Exhibit    How many sellers  are there  Is the product differentiated  and so on  Moreover in the case of monopolies  and quasi monopolies the analyst should evaluate the legislative and regulatory  framework  Can the company set prices freely or are there governmental controls   Finally the analyst should consider the threat of competition from potential entrants 
4,87,This analysis is often summarized by students of corporate strategy as  Porter s five  forces  named after Harvard Business School professor Michael E  Porter  His book  Competitive Strategy presented a systematic analysis of the practice of market strategy   Porter        identified the five forces as 
5,87,  Threat of entry 
6,87,  Power of suppliers 
7,87,  Power of buyers  customers  
8,87,  Threat of substitutes  and
9,87,  Rivalry among existing competitors 
10,87,It is easy to note the parallels between four of these five forces and the columns in  Exhibit    The only  orphan  is the power of suppliers which is not at the core of the  theoretical economic analysis of competition but which has substantial weight in the  practical analysis of competition and profitability 
11,87,Some stock analysts  e g  Dorsey       use the term  economic moat  to suggest that  there are factors protecting the profitability of a firm that are similar to the moats   ditches full of water  that used to protect some medieval castles  A deep moat means  that there is little or no threat of entry by invaders i e  competitors  It also means that  customers are locked in because of high switching costs 
12,87,   PERFECT COMPETITION
13,87,Perfect competition is characterized by the five conditions presented in Exhibit   above 
14,87,   There are a large number of potential buyers and sellers 
15,87,   The products offered by the sellers are virtually identical 
16,87,   There are few or easily surmountable barriers to entry and exit 
17,87,   Sellers have no market pricing power

2,88,   Non price competition is absent 
3,88,While few markets achieve the distinction of being perfectly competitive it is useful to  establish the outcome associated with this market structure as a benchmark against which other  market structures can be compared  The most typical example of perfect competition is found in  certain aspects of the agriculture industry such as the large number of farmers growing corn for  animal feed  Corn is a primary source of food for pork beef and poultry production  A bushel  of corn from Farmer Brown is virtually identical to a bushel of corn from Farmer Lopez  If a  hog farmer needs corn to feed his hogs it does not matter whether the corn comes from Farmer  Brown or Farmer Lopez  Furthermore the aggregate corn market is well defined with active  futures and spot markets  Information about the corn market is easy and inexpensive to access  and there is no way to differentiate the product such as by advertising  Agribusiness is capital  intensive but where arable land is relatively abundant and water is available the barriers to  entry  e g  capital and expertise  for corn production are relatively low 
4,88,     Demand Analysis in Perfectly Competitive Markets
5,88,The price of a homogeneous product sold in a competitive market is determined by the demand  and supply in that market  Economists usually represent demand and supply in a market through  demand and supply curves in a two axis plane where quantity and price are shown on the  x axis and y axis respectively  Economists believe that demand functions have negative slopes  as shown in Exhibit    That is at high prices less is demanded  For normal goods and services  as the price declines the quantity demanded increases  This concept is based on two effects  the  income effect and the substitution effect  The income effect results from the increased  purchasing power the consumer has when prices fall  With lower prices the consumer can  afford to purchase more of the product  The substitution effect comes from the increasing  attractiveness of the lower priced product  If soybean prices are unchanged and corn prices  decrease hog farmers will substitute corn for soybeans as feed for their animals

2,89,Exhibit    Market Demand in Perfect Competition
3,89,Assume the demand for this product can be specified as
4,89,QD         P
5,89,where QD is the quantity of demand and P is the product s price  This demand function can be  rearranged in terms of price 
6,89,P           QD
7,89,In this form total revenue  TR  is equal to price times quantity or P   QD  Thus
8,89,TR   P QD     QD      Q 
9,89,D
10,89,Average revenue  AR  can be found by dividing TR by QD  Therefore
11,89,AR   TR QD      QD      Q  D    QD           QD
12,89,Note that the AR function is identical to the market demand function  The assumption here is  that the relationship between price and quantity demanded is linear  Clearly that may not be the  case in the real market  Another simplifying assumption made is that the price of the product is  the only determinant of demand  Again that is not likely in the real market  For example  economic theory suggests that consumer income is another important factor in determining  demand  The prices of related goods and services such as substitutes and complements are also  considered factors affecting demand for a particular product

2,90,Marginal revenue  MR  is the change in total revenue per extra increment sold when the  quantity sold changes by a small increment  QD  Substituting  QD   QD  into the total revenue   TR  equation marginal revenue can be expressed as 
3,90,    QD  QD       Q 
4,90,D  QD QD  Q   QD

11,90,D
12,90, 
13,90,       QD       QD
14,90,For example suppose QD     and  QD     then total revenue increases from                              to                         and marginal revenue is                         Note that  marginal revenue is equal to       QD        QD   Now suppose that  QD is much smaller for  example  QD        In this case total revenue increases to                                 and  marginal revenue is                    It is straightforward to confirm that as   QD gets smaller  marginal revenue gets closer to           QD  So for very small changes in the quantity sold we  can write marginal revenue as 
15,90,MR        QD
16,90,Although we have introduced the concept of marginal revenue in the context of the demand  curve for the market as a whole its usefulness derives from its role in the output and pricing  decisions of individual firms  As we will see marginal revenue and an analogous concept  marginal cost are critical in determining firms  profit maximizing strategies 
17,90,       Elasticity of Demand
18,90,Consumers respond differently to changes in the price of different kinds of products and  services  The quantity demanded for some products is very price sensitive while for other  products price changes result in little change in the quantity demanded  Economists refer to the  relationship between changes in price and changes in the quantity demanded as the price  elasticity of demand  Therefore the demand for the former group of products those that are  very price sensitive is said to have high price elasticity whereas the demand for the latter  group is said to have low price elasticity  Understanding the sensitivity of demand changes to  changes in price is critical to understanding market structures 
19,90,Price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in the quantity demanded given a  percentage change in the price of a given product  Because the relationship of demand to price  is negative the price elasticity of demand would be negative  Many economists however  present the price elasticity as an absolute value so that price elasticity has a positive sign  We  will follow that convention  Higher price elasticity indicates that consumers are very responsive  to changes in price  Lower values for price elasticity imply that consumers are not very  responsive to price changes  Price elasticity can be measured with the following relationship 
20,90, P       change in QD       change in P 
21,90,where  P is price elasticity of demand QD is the quantity demanded and P is the product s  price 
22,90,Price elasticity of demand falls into three categories  When demand is very responsive to price  change it is identified as elastic  When demand is not responsive to price change it is identified  as inelastic  When the percentage change in quantity demanded is exactly the same as the  percentage change in price the demand is called unitary elastic

2,91, P     Demand is elastic
3,91, P     Demand is unitary elastic
4,91, P     Demand is inelastic
5,91,Price elasticity of demand depends on several factors  Price elasticity will be higher if there are  many close substitutes for the product  If a product has many good alternatives consumers will  be more sensitive to price changes  For example carbonated beverages   soft drinks   have  many close substitutes  It takes strong brand loyalty to keep customer demand high in the soft  drink market when one brand s price is strategically lowered  the price elasticity of demand for  Coca Cola has been estimated to be      For products with numerous close substitutes demand  is highly elastic  For products with few close substitutes demand is lower in price elasticity and  would be considered price inelastic  The demand for first class airline tickets is often seen as  inelastic because only very wealthy people are expected to buy them  the demand for economy  class tickets is elastic because the typical consumer for this product is more budget conscious   Consumers do not consider economy class airline tickets a close substitute for first class  accommodations particularly on long flights 
6,91,The airline ticket example introduces another determinant of price elasticity of demand  The  greater the share of the consumer s budget spent on the item the higher the price elasticity of  demand  Expensive items such as durable goods  e g  refrigerators and televisions  tend to  have higher elasticity measures while less expensive items such as potatoes and salt have  lower elasticity values  Consumers will not change their normal salt consumption if the price of  salt decreases by    percent  Instead they will buy their next package of salt when they run out  with very little regard to the price change 
7,91,The airline ticket also makes a good example for the final factor determining price elasticity   Price elasticity of demand also depends on the length of time within which the demand schedule  is being considered  Holiday airline travel is highly price elastic  Consumers shop vigorously  for vacation flights because they have time to plan their holiday  Business airline travelers  typically have less flexibility in determining their schedules  If your business requires a face to  face meeting with a client then the price of the ticket is somewhat irrelevant  If gasoline prices  increase there is very little you can do in the short run but pay the higher price  However  evidence of commuter choices indicates that many use alternative transportation methods after  the gasoline price spikes  In the long run higher gasoline prices will lead consumers to change  their modes of transportation trading in less efficient vehicles for automobiles with higher gas  mileage or public transit options where available 
8,91,There are two extreme cases of price elasticity of demand  One extreme is the horizontal  demand schedule  This term implies that at a given price the response in the quantity  demanded is infinite  This is the demand schedule faced by a perfectly competitive firm because  it is a price taker as in the case of a corn farmer  If the corn farmer tried to charge a higher  price than the market price nobody would buy her product  On the other hand the farmer has  no incentive to sell at a lower price because she can sell all she can produce at the market price   In a perfectly competitive market the quantity supplied by an individual firm has a negligible  effect on the market price  In the case of perfect price elasticity the measure is  P     
9,91,The other extreme is the vertical demand schedule  The vertical demand schedule implies  that some fixed quantity is demanded regardless of price  An example of such demand is the  diabetic consumer with the need for a certain amount of insulin  If the price of insulin goes up  the patient will not consume less of it  The amount desired is set by the patient s medical  condition  The measure for perfect price inelasticity is  P

2,92,The nature of the elasticity calculation and consumer behavior in the marketplace imply that for  virtually any product  excluding cases of perfect elasticity and perfect inelasticity  demand is  more elastic at higher prices and less elastic  more inelastic  at lower prices  For example at  current low prices the demand for table salt is very inelastic  However if table salt increased in  price to hundreds of dollars per ounce consumers would become more responsive to its price  changes  Exhibit   reports several empirical estimates of price elasticity of demand

9,92,       Other Factors Affecting Demand
10,92,There are two other important forces that influence shifts in consumer demand  One influential  factor is consumer income and the other is the price of a related product  For normal goods as  consumer income increases the demand increases  The degree to which consumers respond to  higher incomes by increasing their demand for goods and services is referred to as income  elasticity of demand  Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to  changes in income  The calculation is similar to that of price elasticity with the percentage  change in income replacing the percentage change in price  Note the new calculation below

2,93,where  Y is income elasticity of demand QD is the quantity demanded and Y is consumer  income  For normal goods the measure  Y will be a positive value  That is as consumers   income rises more of the product is demanded  For products that are considered luxury items  the measure of income elasticity will be greater than one  There are other goods and services  that are considered inferior products  For inferior products as consumer income rises less of  the product is demanded  Inferior products will have negative values for income elasticity  For  example a person on a small income may watch television shows but if this person had more  income she would prefer going to live concerts and theater performances  in this example  television shows would be the inferior good 
3,93,As a technical issue the difference between price elasticity of demand and income elasticity of  demand is that the demand adjustment for price elasticity represents a movement along the  demand schedule because the demand schedule represents combinations of price and quantity   The demand adjustment for income elasticity represents a shift in the demand curve because  with a higher income one can afford to purchase more of the good at any price  For a normal  good an increase in income would shift the demand schedule out to the right away from the  origin of the graph and a decrease in income would shift the demand curve to the left toward  the origin 
4,93,The final factor influencing demand for a product is the change in price of a related product  such as a strong substitute or a complementary product  If a close competitor in the beverage  market lowers its price consumers will substitute that product for your product  Thus your  product s demand curve will shift to the left toward the origin of the graph  Cross price  elasticity of demand is the responsiveness of the demand for product A that is associated with  the change in price of product B 
5,93, X      change in QDA       change in PB 
6,93,where  X is cross price elasticity of demand QDA is the quantity demanded of product A and PB is the price of product B 
7,93,When the cross price elasticity of demand between two products is positive the two products  are considered to be substitutes  For example you may expect to have positive cross price  elasticity between honey and sugar  If the measure of cross price elasticity is negative the two  products are referred to as complements of each other  For example if the price of DVDs  goes up you would expect consumers to buy fewer DVD players  In this case the cross price  elasticity of demand would have a negative value 
8,93,Reviewing cross price elasticity values provides a simple test for the degree of competition in  the market  The more numerous and the closer the substitutes for a product the lower the  pricing power of firms selling in that market  the fewer the substitutes for a product the greater  the pricing power  One interesting application was a US Supreme Court case involving the  production and sale of cellophane by DuPont   The court noted that the relevant product market  for DuPont s cellophane was the broader flexible packaging materials market  The Supreme  Court found the cross price elasticity of demand between cellophane and other flexible  packaging materials to be sufficiently high and exonerated DuPont from a charge of  monopolizing the market

2,94,Because price elasticity of demand relates changes in price to changes in the quantity  demanded there must be a logical relationship between marginal revenue and price elasticity   Recall that marginal revenue equals the change in total revenue given a change in output or  sales  An increase in total revenue results from a decrease in price that results in an increase in  sales  In order for the increase in the quantity demanded to be sufficient to offset the decline in  price the percentage change in quantity demanded must be greater than the percentage decrease  in price  The relationship between TR and price elasticity is as follows 
3,94, P     Demand is elastic   P   TR   and   P   TR    P     Demand is unitary elastic   P   no change in TR      P     Demand is inelastic   P   TR   and   P   TR  
4,94,Total revenue is maximized when marginal revenue is zero  The logic is that as long as  marginal revenue is positive  i e  each additional unit sold contributes to additional total  revenue  total revenue will continue to increase  Only when marginal revenue becomes  negative will total revenue begin to decline  Therefore the percentage decrease in price is  greater than the percentage increase in quantity demanded  The relationship between MR and  price elasticity can be expressed as
5,94,MR   P         P  
6,94,An understanding of price elasticity of demand is an important strategic tool  It would be very  useful to know in advance what would happen to your firm s total revenue if you increased the  product s price  If you are operating in the inelastic portion of the demand curve increasing the  price of the product will increase total revenue  On the other hand if you are operating in the  elastic portion of the product s demand curve increasing the price will decrease total revenue 
7,94,Decision makers can also use the relationship between marginal revenue and price elasticity of  demand in other ways  For example suppose you are a farmer considering planting soybeans or  some other feed crop such as corn  From Exhibit   we know that soybean meal s price  elasticity of demand has been estimated to be       We also know that the current  August        soybean meal price is         per metric ton  Therefore by solving the equation above  we find that the expected marginal revenue per metric ton of soybean meal is           Soybeans may prove to be a profitable crop for the farmer  However just a few years earlier in  August of      the price of a metric ton of soybean meal was          Given the crop s price  elasticity of demand the estimated marginal revenue per metric ton was then         The lower  price translates into lower marginal revenue and might induce the farmer to plant a more  profitable feed crop instead 
8,94,How do business decision makers decide what level of output to bring to the market  To answer  that question the firm must understand its cost of resources its production relations and its  supply function  Once the supply function is well defined and understood it is combined with  the demand analysis to determine the profit maximizing levels of output

2,95,       Consumer Surplus  Value Minus Expenditure
3,95,To this point we have discussed the fundamentals of supply and demand curves and explained  a simple model of how a market can be expected to arrive at an equilibrium combination of  price and quantity  While it is certainly necessary for the analyst to understand the basic  workings of the market model it is also crucial to have a sense of why we might care about the  nature of the equilibrium  In this section we review the concept of consumer surplus which  is helpful in understanding and evaluating business pricing strategies  Consumer surplus is  defined as the difference between the value that a consumer places on the units purchased and  the amount of money that was required to pay for them  It is a measure of the value gained by  the buyer from the transaction 
4,95,To get an intuitive feel for the concept of consumer surplus consider the last thing you  purchased  Whatever it was think of how much you actually paid for it  Now contrast that price  with the maximum amount you would have been willing to pay rather than go without the item  altogether  If those two numbers are different we say you received some consumer surplus  from your purchase  You got a  bargain  because you would have been willing to pay more  than you had to pay 
5,95,Earlier we referred to the law of demand which says that as price falls consumers are willing  to buy more of the good  This observation translates into a negatively sloped demand curve   Alternatively we could say that the highest price that consumers are willing to pay for an  additional unit declines as they consume more and more of a good  In this way we can interpret  their willingness to pay as a measure of how much they value each additional unit of the good   This is a very important point  In order to purchase a unit of some good consumers must give  up something else they value  So the price they are willing to pay for an additional unit of a  good is a measure of how much they value that unit in terms of the other goods they must  sacrifice to consume it 
6,95,If demand curves are negatively sloped it must be because the value of each additional unit of  the good falls as more of the good is consumed  We shall explore this concept further below  but for now it is enough to recognize that the demand curve can therefore be considered a  marginal value curve because it shows the highest price consumers would be willing to pay  for each additional unit  In effect the demand curve is the willingness of consumers to pay for  each additional unit 
7,95,This interpretation of the demand curve allows us to measure the total value of consuming any  given quantity of a good  It is the sum of all the marginal values of each unit consumed up to  and including the last unit  Graphically this measure translates into the area under the  consumer s demand curve up to and including the last unit consumed as shown in Exhibit    where the consumer is choosing to buy Q  units of the good at a price of P   The marginal value  of the Q  th unit is clearly P  because that is the highest price the consumer is willing to pay for  that unit  Importantly however the marginal value of each unit up to the Q  th is greater than P

2,96,Exhibit    Consumer Surplus
3,96,Because the consumer would have been willing to pay more for each of those units than she  actually paid  P   we can say she received more value than the cost to her of buying them  This  extra value is the buyer s consumer surplus  The total value of quantity Q  to the buyer is the  area of the vertically crosshatched trapezoid in Exhibit    The total expenditure is only the area  of the rectangle with height P  and base Q   bottom section   The total consumer surplus  received from buying Q  units at a level price of P  per unit is the difference between the area  under the demand curve and the area of the rectangle P    Q   The resulting area is shown as the  lightly shaded triangle  upper section

4,97,Consider two corn farmers Mr  Brown and Ms  Lopez  They both have land available to them  to grow corn and can sell at one price say   currency units per kilogram  They will try to  produce as much corn as is profitable at that price  If the price is driven up to   currency units  per kilogram by new consumers entering the market say ethanol producers Mr  Brown and  Ms  Lopez will try to produce more corn  To increase their output levels they may have to use  less productive land increase irrigation use more fertilizer or all three  Their production costs  will likely increase  They will both still try to produce as much corn as possible in order to  profit at the new higher price of   currency units per kilogram  Exhibit   illustrates this  example  Note that the supply functions for the individual firms have positive slopes  Thus as  prices increase the firms supply greater quantities of the product

4,98,where QS is the quantity supplied and P is the price of the product 
5,98,Before we analyze the optimal supply level for the firm we need to point out that economic  costs and profits differ from accounting costs and profits in a significant way  Economic costs include all the remuneration needed to keep the productive resource in its current employment  or to acquire the resource for productive use 
6,98,In order to evaluate the remuneration needed to keep the resource in its current use and attract  new resources for productive use economists refer to the resource s opportunity cost   Opportunity cost is measured by determining the resource s next best opportunity  If a corn  farmer could be employed in an alternative position in the labor market with an income of        then the opportunity cost of the farmer s labor is        Similarly the farmer s land  and capital could be leased to another farmer or sold and reinvested in another type of business   The return foregone by not doing so is an opportunity cost  In economic terms total cost  includes the full normal market return on all the resources utilized in the business  Economic  profit is the difference between TR and total cost  TC   Economic profit differs from  accounting profit because accounting profit does not include opportunity cost  Accounting  profit includes only explicit payments to outside providers of resources  e g  workers vendors  lenders  and depreciation based on the historic cost of physical capital

2,100,Demand Curves in Perfect Competition
3,100,Is it possible that the demand schedule faced by Firm A is horizontal while the demand  schedule faced by the market as a whole is downward sloping 
4,100,A  No because Firm A can change its output based on demand changes 
5,100,B  No because a horizontal demand curve means that elasticity is infinite 
6,100,C  Yes because consumers can go to another firm if Firm A charges a higher price  and Firm A can sell all it produces at the market price 
7,100,Solution 
8,100,C is correct  Firm A cannot charge a higher price and has no incentive to sell at a price  below the market price 
9,100,To analyze the firm s revenue position recall that average revenue is equivalent to the firm s  demand function  Therefore the horizontal line that represents the firm s demand curve is the  firm s AR schedule 
10,100,Marginal revenue is the incremental increase in total revenue associated with each additional  unit sold  For every extra unit the firm sells it receives       Thus the firm s MR schedule is  also the horizontal line at       TR is calculated by multiplying AR by the quantity of products  sold  Total revenue is the area under the AR line at the point where the firm produces the  output  In the case of perfect competition the following conditions hold for the individual firm 
11,100,Price   Average revenue   Marginal revenue
12,100,The next step is to develop the firm s cost functions  The firm knows that it can sell the entire  product it produces at the market s equilibrium price  How much should it produce  That  decision is determined by analysis of the firm s costs and revenues  A corn farmer uses three  primary resources  land labor and capital  In economics capital is any man made aid to  production  For the corn farmer his or her capital includes the irrigation system tractors  harvesters trucks grain bins fertilizer and so forth  The labor includes the farmer perhaps  members of the farmer s family and hired labor  In the initial stages of production only the  farmer and the farmer s family are cultivating the land with a significant investment in capital   They have a tractor fertilizer irrigation equipment grain bins seed and a harvester  The  investment in land and capital is relatively high compared with the labor input  In this  production phase the average cost of producing a bushel of corn is high  As they begin to  expand by adding labor to the collection of expensive land and capital the average cost of  producing corn begins to decline for example because one tractor can be used more  intensively to plow a larger amount of land  When the combination of land labor and capital  approaches an efficient range the average cost of producing a bushel of corn declines

2,101,Given a certain level of technology there is a limit to the increase in productivity  Eventually  something begins to cause declining marginal productivity  That is each additional unit of input  produces a progressively smaller increase in output  This force is called the law of  diminishing returns  This  law  helps define the shape of the firm s cost functions  Average  cost and marginal cost will be U shaped  Over the initial stages of output average and marginal  costs will decline  At some level of output the law of diminishing returns will overtake the  efficiencies in production and average and marginal costs will increase 
3,101,Average cost  AC  is Total cost  TC  divided by Output  Q   Therefore
4,101,AC   TC Q
5,101,Note that we have defined average cost  AC  in terms of total costs  Many authors refer to this  as  average total cost  to distinguish it from a related concept  average variable cost  which  omits fixed costs  In the remainder of this reading average cost should be understood to mean  average total cost 
6,101,Marginal cost  MC  is the change in TC associated with an incremental change in output 
7,101,MC    TC  Q
8,101,By definition fixed costs do not vary with output so marginal cost reflects only changes in  variable costs   MC declines initially because processes can be made more efficient and  specialization makes workers more proficient at their tasks  However at some higher level of  output MC begins to increase  e g  must pay workers a higher wage to have them work  overtime and in agriculture less fertile land must be brought into production   MC and AC will  be equal at the level of output where AC is minimized  This is a mathematical necessity and  intuitive  If you employ the least expensive labor in the initial phase of production average and  marginal cost will decline  Eventually additional labor will be more costly  For example if the  labor market is at or near full employment in order to attract additional workers you must pay  higher wages than they are currently earning elsewhere  Thus the additional  marginal  labor is  more costly and the higher cost increases the overall average as soon as MC exceeds AC   Exhibit   illustrates the relationship between AC and MC

3,107,Innovation of process is related to production methods  For example instead of mixing  cement by hand since the invention of the electric engine it has been possible to use  electric mixers  A more recent innovation has been to use the internet to provide  technical support to personal computer users  A technician can remotely log on to the  customer s PC and fix problems instead of providing instructions over the phone  The  result is likely the same but the process is more efficient 
4,107,Innovation of product is related to the product itself  MP  players smart phones robot  surgery and GPS vehicle monitoring have existed only for a few years  They are new  products and services  While portable music players existed before the MP  player no  similar service existed before GPS monitoring of personal vehicles and freight trucks  was invented 
5,107,How does the reality of continuous innovation of product and process which is a  characteristic of modern economies fit into the ideal model of perfect competition  where the product is made by a huge number of tiny anonymous suppliers  This seems  a contradiction because the tiny suppliers cannot all be able to invent new  products and indeed the markets for portable music players and smart phones do not  look like perfect competition 
6,107,Schumpeter suggested that perfect competition is more of a long run type of market  In  the short run a company develops a new process or product and is the only one to take  advantage of the innovation  This company likely will have high profits and will outpace  any competitors  A second stage is what Schumpeter called the swarming  as when a  group of bees leaves a hive to follow a queen   In this case some entrepreneurs notice  the innovation and follow the innovator through imitation  Some of them will fail while  others will succeed and possibly be more successful than the initial innovator  The third  stage occurs when the new technology is no longer new because everyone has imitated  it  At this point no economic profits are realized because the new process or product is  no longer a competitive advantage in the sense that everyone has it which is when  perfect competition prevails and we have long run equilibrium until a new innovation of  process or product is introduced 
7,107,   MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
8,107,Early in the   th century economists began to realize that most markets did not operate under  the conditions of perfect competition   Many market structures exhibited characteristics of  strong competitive forces  however other distinct non competitive factors played important  roles in the market  As the name implies monopolistic competition is a hybrid market  The most  distinctive factor in monopolistic competition is product differentiation  Recall the  characteristics from Exhibit   
9,107,   There are a large number of potential buyers and sellers

2,108,   The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products offered by other  firms and each firm tries to make its product look different 
3,108,   Entry into and exit from the market are possible with fairly low costs 
4,108,   Firms have some pricing power 
5,108,   Suppliers differentiate their products through advertising and other non price strategies 
6,108,While the market is made up of many firms that compose the product group each producer  attempts to distinguish its product from that of the others  Product differentiation is  accomplished in a variety of ways  For example consider the wide variety of communication  devices available today  Decades ago when each communication market was controlled by a  regulated single seller  the telephone company  all telephones were alike  In the deregulated  market of today the variety of physical styles and colors is extensive  All versions accomplish  many of the same tasks 
7,108,The communication device manufacturers and providers differentiate their products with  different colors styles networks bundled applications conditional contracts functionality and  more  Advertising is usually the avenue pursued to convince consumers there is a difference  between the goods in the product group  Successful advertising and trademark branding result  in customer loyalty  A good example is the brand loyalty associated with Harley Davidson  motorcycles  Harley Davidson s customers believe that their motorcycles are truly different  from and better than all other motorcycles  The same kind of brand loyalty exists for many  fashion creations and cosmetics 
8,108,The extent to which the producer is successful in product differentiation determines pricing  power in the market  Very successful differentiation results in a market structure that resembles  the single seller market  monopoly   However because there are relatively low entry and exit  costs competition will in the long run drive prices and revenues down toward an equilibrium  similar to perfect competition  Thus the hybrid market displays characteristics found in both  perfectly competitive and monopoly markets 
9,108,     Demand Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets
10,108,Because each good sold in the product group is somewhat different from the others the demand  curve for each firm in the monopolistic competition market structure is downward sloping to the  right  Price and the quantity demanded are negatively related  Lowering the price will increase  the quantity demanded and raising the price will decrease the quantity demanded  There will be  ranges of prices within which demand is elastic and  lower  prices at which demand is inelastic   Exhibit    illustrates the demand marginal revenue and cost structures facing a  monopolistically competitive firm in the short run

2,109,In the short run the profit maximizing choice is the level of output where MR   MC  Because  the product is somewhat different from that of the competitors the firm can charge the price  determined by the demand curve  Therefore in Exhibit    Q  is the ideal level of output and P  is the price consumers are willing to pay to acquire that quantity  Total revenue is the area of  the rectangle P    Q  
3,109,     Supply Analysis in Monopolistically Competitive Markets
4,109,In perfect competition the firm s supply schedule is represented by the marginal cost schedule   In monopolistic competition there is no well defined supply function  The information used to  determine the appropriate level of output is based on the intersection of MC and MR  However  the price that will be charged is based on the market demand schedule  The firm s supply curve  should measure the quantity the firm is willing to supply at various prices  That information is  not represented by either marginal cost or average cost 
5,109,     Optimal Price and Output in Monopolistically Competitive  Markets
6,109,As seen in Section     in the short run the profit maximizing choice is the level of output  where MR   MC and total revenue is the area of the rectangle P    Q  in Exhibit    
7,109,The average cost of producing Q  units of the product is C  and the total cost is the area of the  rectangle C    Q   The difference between TR and TC is economic profit  The profit  relationship is described as

3,110,where   is total profit TR is total revenue and TC is total cost 
4,110,THE BENEFITS OF IMPERFECT COMPETITION
5,110,Is monopolistic competition indeed imperfect that is is it a bad thing  At first one  would say that it is an inefficient market structure because prices are higher and the  quantity supplied is less than in perfect competition  At the same time in the real world  we see more markets characterized by monopolistic competition than markets meeting  the strict conditions of perfect competition  If monopolistic competition were that  inefficient one wonders why would it be so common 
6,110,A part of the explanation goes back to Schumpeter  Firms try to differentiate their  products to meet the needs of customers  Differentiation provides a profit incentive to  innovate experiment with new products and services and potentially improve the  standard of living 
7,110,Moreover because each customer has tastes and preferences that are a bit different  slight variations of each good or service are likely to capture the niche of the market that  prefers them  An example is the market for candy where one can find chocolate  liquorice mint fruit and many other flavors 
8,110,A further reason why monopolistic competition may be good is that people like variety   Traditional economic theories of international trade suggested that countries should buy  products from other countries that they cannot produce domestically  Therefore Norway  should buy bananas from a tropical country and sell crude oil in exchange  But this is  not the only kind of exchange that happens in reality  For example Germany imports  Honda Subaru and Toyota cars from Japan and sells Volkswagen Porsche Mercedes  and BMW cars to Japan  In theory this should not occur because each of the countries  produces good cars domestically and does not need to import them  The truth however   see for example Krugman       is that consumers in both countries enjoy variety   Some Japanese drivers prefer to be at the steering wheel of a BMW  others like Hondas  and the same happens in Germany  Variety and product differentiation therefore are  not necessarily bad things 
9,110,     Factors Affecting Long Run Equilibrium in  Monopolistically Competitive Markets
10,110,Because TC includes all costs associated with production including opportunity cost economic  profit is a signal to the market and that signal will attract more competition  Just as with the  perfectly competitive market structure with relatively low entry costs more firms will enter the  market and lure some customers away from the firm making an economic profit  The loss of  customers to new entrant firms will drive down the demand for all firms producing similar  products  In the long run for the monopolistically competitive firm economic profit will fall to  zero  Exhibit    illustrates the condition of long run equilibrium for monopolistic competition

2,111,Exhibit     Long Run Equilibrium in Monopolistic Competition
3,111,In long run equilibrium output is still optimal at the level where MR   MC which is Q  in  Exhibit     Again the price consumers are willing to pay for any amount of the product is  determined from the demand curve  That price is P  for the quantity Q  in Exhibit    and total  revenue is the area of the rectangle P    Q   Notice that unlike long run equilibrium in perfect  competition in the market of monopolistic competition the equilibrium position is at a higher  level of average cost than the level of output that minimizes average cost  Average cost does not  reach its minimum until output level Q  is achieved  Total cost in this long run equilibrium  position is the area of the rectangle C    Q   Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost   In Exhibit    economic profit is zero because total revenue equals total cost  P    Q    C    Q  
4,111,In the hybrid market of monopolistic competition zero economic profit in long run equilibrium  resembles perfect competition  However the long run level of output Q  is less than Q  which  corresponds to the minimum average cost of production and would be the long run level of  output in a perfectly competitive market  In addition the economic cost in monopolistic  competition includes some cost associated with product differentiation such as advertising  In  perfect competition there are no costs associated with advertising or marketing because all  products are homogeneous  Prices are lower but consumers may have little variety

2,112,   OLIGOPOLY
3,112,An oligopoly market structure is characterized by only a few firms doing business in a relevant  market  The products must all be similar and to a great extent be substitutes for one another  In  some oligopoly markets the goods or services may be differentiated by marketing and strong  brand recognition as in the markets for breakfast cereals and for bottled or canned beverages   Other examples of oligopoly markets are made up of homogeneous products with little or no  attempt at product differentiation such as petroleum and cement  The most distinctive  characteristic of oligopoly markets is the small number of firms that dominate the market   There are so few firms in the relevant market that their pricing decisions are interdependent   That is each firm s pricing decision is based on the expected retaliation by the other firms   Recall from Exhibit   the characteristics of oligopoly markets 
4,112,   There are a small number of potential sellers 
5,112,   The products offered by each seller are close substitutes for the products offered by other  firms and may be differentiated by brand or homogeneous and unbranded 
6,112,   Entry into the market is difficult with fairly high costs and significant barriers to  competition 
7,112,   Firms typically have substantial pricing power 
8,112,   Products are often highly differentiated through marketing features and other non price  strategies 
9,112,Because there are so few firms each firm can have some degree of pricing power which can  result in substantial profits  Another by product of the oligopoly market structure is the  attractiveness of price collusion  Even without price collusion a dominant firm may easily  become the price maker in the market  Oligopoly markets without collusion typically have the  most sophisticated pricing strategies  Examples of non colluding oligopolies include the US  tobacco market and the Thai beer market  In      four firms controlled    percent of the US  tobacco industry   Brands owned by Singha Co  and by ThaiBev controlled over    percent of  the Thai beer market in        This situation is expected to change soon as the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations trade agreement will open the doors to competition from other  ASEAN producers   Perhaps the most well known oligopoly market with collusion is the OPEC  cartel which seeks to control prices in the petroleum market by fostering agreements among  oil producing countries 
10,112,     Demand Analysis and Pricing Strategies in Oligopoly  Markets
11,112,Oligopoly markets  demand curves depend on the degree of pricing interdependence  In a  market where collusion is present the aggregate market demand curve is divided up by the  individual production participants  Under non colluding market conditions each firm faces an  individual demand curve  Furthermore non colluding oligopoly market demand characteristics  depend on the pricing strategies adopted by the participating firms  There are three basic pricing  strategies  pricing interdependence the Cournot assumption and the Nash equilibrium

2,113,The first pricing strategy is to assume pricing interdependence among the firms in the  oligopoly  A good example of this situation is any market where there are  price wars  such as  the commercial airline industry  For example flying out of the Atlanta Georgia hub Delta Air  Lines and AirTran Airways jointly serve several cities  AirTran is a low cost carrier and  typically offers lower fares to destinations out of Atlanta  Delta tends to match the lower fares  for those cities also served by AirTran when the departure and arrival times are similar to its  own  However when Delta offers service to the same cities at different time slots Delta s ticket  prices are higher 
3,113,The most common pricing strategy assumption in these price war markets is that competitors  will match a price reduction and ignore a price increase  The logic is that by lowering its price  to match a competitor s price reduction the firm will not experience a reduction in customer  demand  Conversely by not matching the price increase the firm stands to attract customers  away from the firm that raised its prices  The oligopolist s demand relationship must represent  the potential increase in market share when rivals  price increases are not matched and no  significant change in market share when rivals  price decreases are matched 
4,113,Given a prevailing price the price elasticity of demand will be much greater if the price is  increased and less if the price is decreased  The firm s customers are more responsive to price  increases because its rivals have lower prices  Alternatively the firm s customers are less  responsive to price decreases because its rivals will match its price change 
5,113,This implies that the oligopolistic firm faces two different demand structures one associated  with price increases and another relating to price reductions  Each demand function will have its  own marginal revenue structure as well  Consider the demand and marginal revenue functions  in Exhibit    A   The functions DP  and MRP  represent the demand and marginal revenue  schedules associated with higher prices while the functions DP  and MRP  represent the lower  prices  demand and marginal revenue schedules  The two demand schedules intersect at the  prevailing price  i e  the price where price increase and price decrease are both equal to zero

2,114,This oligopolistic pricing strategy results in a kinked demand curve with the two segments  representing the different competitor reactions to price changes  The kink in the demand curve  also yields a discontinuous marginal revenue structure with one part associated with the price  increase segment of demand and the other relating to the price decrease segment  Therefore the  firm s overall demand equals the relevant portion of DP  and the relevant portion of DP   Exhibit     B  represents the firm s new demand and marginal revenue schedules  The firm s demand  schedule in Exhibit    B  is segment DP  and DP  where overall demand D   DP    DP

2,115,Exhibit    B   Kinked Demand Curve in Oligopoly Market
3,115,Notice in Exhibit    B  that a wide variety of cost structures are consistent with the prevailing  price  If the firm has relatively low marginal costs MC  the profit maximizing pricing rule  established earlier MR   MC still holds for the oligopoly firm  Marginal cost can rise to MC  and MC  before the firm s profitability is challenged  If the marginal cost curve MC  passes  through the gap in marginal revenue the most profitable price and output combination remains  unchanged at the prevailing price and original level of output 
4,115,Criticism of the kinked demand curve analysis focuses on its inability to determine what the  prevailing price is from the outset  The kinked demand curve analysis does help explain why  stable prices have been observed in oligopoly markets and is therefore a useful tool for  analyzing such markets  However because it cannot determine the original prevailing price it is  considered an incomplete pricing analysis 
5,115,The second pricing strategy was first developed by French economist Augustin Cournot in        In the Cournot assumption each firm determines its profit maximizing production  level by assuming that the other firms  output will not change  This assumption simplifies  pricing strategy because there is no need to guess what the other firm will do to retaliate  It also  provides a useful approach to analyzing real world behavior in oligopoly markets  Take the  most basic oligopoly market situation a two firm duopoly market   In equilibrium neither firm  has an incentive to change output given the other firm s production level  Each firm attempts to  maximize its own profits under the assumption that the other firm will continue producing the  same level of output in the future  The Cournot strategy assumes that this pattern continues until  each firm reaches its long run equilibrium position  In long run equilibrium output and price  are stable  There is no change in price or output that will increase profits for either firm

3,116,The Cournot strategy s solution can be found by setting QD   q    q  where q  and q  represent  the output levels of the two firms  Each firm seeks to maximize profit and each firm believes  the other firm will not change output as it changes its own output  Cournot s assumption   The  firm will maximize profit where MR   MC  Rearranging the aggregate demand function in  terms of price we get

10,117,It can be shown that as the number of firms increases from two to three from three to four and  so on the output and price equilibrium positions move toward the competitive equilibrium  solution  This result has historically been the theoretical basis for the antitrust policies  established in the United States

2,118,The third pricing strategy is attributed to one of the      Nobel Prize winners John Nash who  first developed the general concepts  In the previous analysis the concept of market equilibrium  occurs when firms are achieving their optimum remuneration under the circumstances they face   In this optimum environment the firm has no motive to change price or output level  Existing  firms are earning a normal return  zero economic profit  leaving no motive for entry to or exit  from the market  All firms in the market are producing at the output level where price equals the  average cost of production 
3,118,In game theory  the set of tools that decision makers use to consider responses by rival  decision makers  the Nash equilibrium is present when two or more participants in a non  cooperative game have no incentive to deviate from their respective equilibrium strategies after  they have considered and anticipated their opponent s rational choices or strategies  In the  context of oligopoly markets the Nash equilibrium is an equilibrium defined by the  characteristic that none of the oligopolists can increase its profits by unilaterally changing its  pricing strategy  The assumption is made that each participating firm does the best it can given  the reactions of its rivals  Each firm anticipates that the other firms will react to any change  made by competitors by doing the best they can under the altered circumstances  The firms in  the oligopoly market have interdependent actions  The actions are non cooperative with each  firm making decisions that maximize its own profits  The firms do not collude in an effort to  maximize joint profits  The equilibrium is reached when all firms are doing the best they can  given the actions of their rivals 
4,118,Exhibit    illustrates the duopoly result from the Nash equilibrium  Assume there are two firms  in the market ArcCo and BatCo  ArcCo and BatCo can charge high prices or low prices for the  product  The market outcomes are shown in Exhibit    
5,118,Exhibit     Nash Equilibrium in Duopoly Market

2,119,For example the top left solution indicates that when both ArcCo and BatCo offer the product  at low prices ArcCo earns a profit of    and BatCo earns     The top right solution shows that  if ArcCo offers the product at a low price BatCo earns zero profits  The solution with the  maximum joint profits is the lower right equilibrium where both firms charge high prices for  the product  Joint profits are     in this solution 
3,119,However the Nash equilibrium requires that each firm behaves in its own best interest  BatCo  can improve its position by offering the product at low prices when ArcCo is charging high  prices  In the lower left solution BatCo maximizes its profits at      While ArcCo can earn      in its best solution it can do so only if BatCo also agrees to charge high prices  This option is  clearly not in BatCo s best interest because it can increase its return from     to     by  charging lower prices 
4,119,This scenario brings up the possibility of collusion  If ArcCo agrees to share at least    of its      when both companies are charging high prices BatCo should also be willing to charge high  prices  While in general such collusion is unlawful in most countries it remains a tempting  alternative  Clearly conditions in oligopolistic industries encourage collusion with a small  number of competitors and interdependent pricing behavior  Collusion is motivated by several  factors  increased profits reduced cash flow uncertainty and improved opportunities to  construct barriers to entry 
5,119,When collusive agreements are made openly and formally the firms involved are called a  cartel  In some cases collusion is successful  other times the forces of competition overpower  collusive behavior  There are six major factors that affect the chances of successful collusion   
6,119,   The number and size distribution of sellers  Successful collusion is more likely if the  number of firms is small or if one firm is dominant  Collusion becomes more difficult as  the number of firms increases or if the few firms have similar market shares  When the  firms have similar market shares the competitive forces tend to overshadow the benefits  of collusion 
7,119,   The similarity of the products  When the products are homogeneous collusion is more  successful  The more differentiated the products the less likely it is that collusion will  succeed 
8,119,   Cost structure  The more similar the firms  cost structures the more likely it is that  collusion will succeed 
9,119,   Order size and frequency  Successful collusion is more likely when orders are frequent  received on a regular basis and relatively small  Frequent small orders received  regularly diminish the opportunities and rewards for cheating on the collusive agreement 
10,119,   The strength and severity of retaliation  Oligopolists will be less likely to break the  collusive agreement if the threat of retaliation by the other firms in the market is severe

2,120,   The degree of external competition  The main reason to enter into the formal collusion is  to increase overall profitability of the market and rising profits attract competition  For  example the average extraction cost of a barrel of crude oil from the Persian Gulf is     while the average cost from the Alaskan fields is      It is more likely that crude oil  producers in the Persian Gulf will successfully collude because of the similarity in their  cost structures  If OPEC had held crude oil prices down below     per barrel there  would not have been a viable economic argument to explore oil fields in Alaska   Extracting petroleum from Canadian oil sands becomes economically attractive only at  prices above     per barrel  OPEC s successful cartel raised crude oil prices to the point  where outside sources became economically possible and in doing so increased the  competition the cartel faces 
3,120,There are other possible oligopoly strategies that are associated with decision making based on  game theory  The Cournot equilibrium and the Nash equilibrium are examples of specific  strategic games  A strategic game is any interdependent behavioral choice employed by  individuals or groups that share a common goal  e g  military units sports teams or business  decision makers   Another prominent decision making strategy in oligopolistic markets is the  first mover advantage in the Stackelberg model named after the economist who first  conceptualized the strategy    The important difference between the Cournot model and the  Stackelberg model is that Cournot assumes that in a duopoly market decision making is  simultaneous while Stackelberg assumes that decisions are made sequentially  In the  Stackelberg model the leader firm chooses its output first and then the follower firm chooses  after observing the leader s output  It can be shown that the leader firm has a distinct advantage  being a first mover    In the Stackelberg game the leader can aggressively overproduce to  force the follower to scale back its production or even punish or eliminate the weaker opponent   This approach is sometimes referred to as a  top dog  strategy    The leader earns more than in  Cournot s simultaneous game while the follower earns less  Many other strategic games are  possible in oligopoly markets  The important conclusion is that the optimal strategy of the firm  depends on what its adversary does  The price and marginal revenue the firm receives for its  product depend on both its decisions and its adversary s decisions 
4,120,     Supply Analysis in Oligopoly Markets
5,120,As in monopolistic competition the oligopolist does not have a well defined supply function   That is there is no way to determine the oligopolist s optimal levels of output and price  independent of demand conditions and competitor s strategies  However the oligopolist still  has a cost function that determines the optimal level of supply  Therefore the profit  maximizing rule established earlier is still valid  The level of output that maximizes profit is  where MR   MC  The price to charge is determined by what price consumers are willing to pay  for that quantity of the product  Therefore the equilibrium price comes from the demand curve  while the output level comes from the relationship between marginal revenue and marginal cost 
6,120,Consider an oligopoly market in which one of the firms is dominant and thus able to be the  price leader  Dominant firms generally have    percent or greater market share  When one firm  dominates an oligopoly market it does so because it has greater capacity has a lower cost  structure was first to market or has greater customer loyalty than other firms in the market

2,121,Assuming there is no collusion the dominant firm becomes the price maker and therefore its  actions are similar to monopoly behavior in its segment of the market  The other firms in the  market follow the pricing patterns of the dominant firm  Why wouldn t the price followers  attempt to gain market share by undercutting the dominant firm s price  The most common  explanation is that the dominant firm s supremacy often stems from a lower cost of production   Usually the price followers would rather charge a price that is even higher than the dominant  firm s price choice  If they attempt to undercut the dominant firm the followers risk a price war  with a lower cost producer that can threaten their survival  Some believe that one explanation  for the price leadership position of the dominant firm is simply convenience  Only one firm has  to make the pricing decisions and the others can simply follow its lead 
3,121,Exhibit    establishes the dominant firm s pricing decision  The dominant firm s demand  schedule DL is a substantial share of the total market demand DT  The low cost position of the  dominant firm is represented by its marginal cost MCL  The sum of the marginal costs of the  price followers is established as  MCF and represents a higher cost of production than that of  the price leader

2,122,Exhibit     Dominant Oligopolist s Price Leadership
3,122,There is an important reason why the total demand curve and the leader demand curve are not  parallel in Exhibit     Remember that the leader is the low cost producer  Therefore as price  decreases fewer of the smaller suppliers will be able to profitably remain in the market and  several will exit because they do not want to sell below cost  Therefore the leader will have a  larger market share as P decreases which implies that QL increases at a low price exactly as  shown by a steeper DT in the diagram 
4,122,The price leader identifies its profit maximizing output where MRL   MCL at output QL  This is  the quantity it wants to supply  however the price it will charge is determined by its segment of  the total demand function DL  At price PL the dominant firm will supply quantity QL of total  demand DT  The price followers will supply the difference to the market  QT   QL    QF   Therefore neither the dominant firm nor the follower firms have a single functional relationship  that determines the quantity supplied at various prices

2,123,     Optimal Price and Output in Oligopoly Markets
3,123,From the discussion above it is clear that there is no single optimum price and output analysis  that fits all oligopoly market situations  The interdependence among the few firms that make up  the oligopoly market provides a complex set of pricing alternatives depending on the  circumstances in each market  In the case of the kinked demand curve the optimum price is the  prevailing price at the kink in the demand function  However as previously noted the kinked  demand curve analysis does not provide insight into what established the prevailing price in the  first place 
4,123,Perhaps the case of the dominant firm with the other firms following the price leader is the  most obvious  In that case the optimal price is determined at the output level where MR   MC   The profit maximizing price is then determined by the output position of the segment of the  demand function faced by the dominant firm  The price followers have little incentive to change  the leader s price  In the case of the Cournot assumption each firm assumes that the other firms  will not alter their output following the dominant firm s selection of its price and output level 
5,123,Therefore again the optimum price is determined by the output level where MR   MC  In the  case of the Nash equilibrium each firm will react to the circumstances it faces maximizing its  own profit  These adjustments continue until there are stable prices and levels of output   Because of the interdependence there is no certainty as to the individual firm s price and output  level 
6,123,     Factors Affecting Long Run Equilibrium in Oligopoly  Markets
7,123,Long run economic profits are possible for firms operating in oligopoly markets  However  history has shown that over time the market share of the dominant firm declines  Profits attract  entry by other firms into the oligopoly market  Over time the marginal costs of the entrant  firms decrease because they adopt more efficient production techniques the dominant firm s  demand and marginal revenue shrink and the profitability of the dominant firm declines  In the  early     s J P  Morgan Elbert Gary Andrew Carnegie and Charles M  Schwab created the  United States Steel Corporation  US Steel   When it was first formed in      US Steel  controlled    percent of the market  By      US Steel s market share had declined to     percent and by      its market share was    percent 
8,123,In the long run optimal pricing strategy must include the reactions of rival firms  History has  proven that pricing wars should be avoided because any gains in market share are temporary   Decreasing prices to drive competitors away lowers total revenue to all participants in the  oligopoly market  Innovation may be a way though sometimes an uneconomical one to  maintain market leadership 
9,123,OLIGOPOLIES  APPEARANCE VERSUS BEHAVIOR
10,123,When is an oligopoly not an oligopoly  There are two extreme cases of this situation  A  normal oligopoly has a few firms producing a differentiated good and this  differentiation gives them pricing power

2,124,At one end of the spectrum we have the oligopoly with a credible threat of entry  In  practice if the oligopolists are producing a good or service that can be easily replicated  has limited economies of scale and is not protected by brand recognition or patents  they will not be able to charge high prices  The easier it is for a new supplier to enter the  market the lower the margins  In practice this oligopoly will behave very much like a  perfectly competitive market 
3,124,At the opposite end of the spectrum we have the case of the cartel  Here the  oligopolists collude and act as if they were a single firm  In practice a very effective  cartel enacts a cooperative strategy  As shown in Section     instead of going to a Nash  equilibrium the cartel participants go to the more lucrative  for them  cooperative  equilibrium 
4,124,A cartel may be explicit  that is based on a contract  or implicit  based on signals   An  example of signals in a duopoly would be that one of the firms reduces its prices and the  other does not  Because the firm not cutting prices refuses to start a price war the firm  that cut prices may interpret this signal as a  suggestion  to raise prices to a higher level  than before so that profits may increase for both 
5,124,   MONOPOLY
6,124,Monopoly market structure is at the opposite end of the spectrum from perfect competition  For  various reasons there are significant barriers to entry such that a single firm produces a highly  specialized product and faces no threat of competition  There are no good substitutes for the  product in the relevant market and the market demand function is the same as the individual  firm s demand schedule  The distinguishing characteristics of monopoly are that a single firm  represents the market and significant barriers to entry exist  Exhibit   identified the  characteristics of monopoly markets 
7,124,   There is a single seller of a highly differentiated product 
8,124,   The product offered by the seller has no close substitute 
9,124,   Entry into the market is very difficult with high costs and significant barriers to  competition 
10,124,   The firm has considerable pricing power 
11,124,   The product is differentiated through non price strategies such as advertising 
12,124,Monopoly markets are unusual  With a single seller dominating the market power over price  decisions is significant  For a single seller to achieve this power there must be factors that  allow the monopoly to exist  One obvious source of monopoly power would be a patent or  copyright that prevents other firms from entering the market  Patent and copyright laws exist to  reward intellectual capital and investment in research and development  In so doing they  provide significant barriers to entry

2,125,Another possible source of market power is control over critical resources used for production   One example is De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  De Beers owned or controlled all  diamond mining operations in South Africa and established pricing agreements with other  important diamond producers  In doing so De Beers was able to control the prices for cut  diamonds for decades  Technically De Beers was a near monopoly dominant firm rather than a  pure monopoly although its pricing procedure for cut diamonds resembled monopoly behavior 
3,125,Perhaps the most common form of monopolistic market power occurs as the result of  government controlled authorization  In most urban areas a single source of water and sewer  services is offered  In some cases these services are offered by a government controlled entity   In other cases private companies provide the services under government regulation  Such   natural  monopolies require a large initial investment that benefits from economies of scale   therefore government may authorize a single seller to provide a certain service because having  multiple sellers would be too costly  For example electricity in most markets is provided by a  single seller  Economies of scale result when significant capital investment benefits from  declining long run average costs  In the case of electricity a large gas fueled power plant  producing electricity for a large area is substantially more efficient than having a small diesel  generator for every building  That is the average cost of generating and delivering a kilowatt of  electricity will be substantially lower with the single power station but the initial fixed cost of  building the power station and the lines delivering electricity to each home factory and office  will be very high 
4,125,In the case of natural monopolies limiting the market to a single seller is considered beneficial  to society  One water and sewer system is deemed better for the community than dozens of  competitors because building multiple infrastructures for running water and sewer service  would be particularly expensive and complicated  One electrical power grid supplying  electricity for a community can make large capital investments in generating plants and lower  the long run average cost while multiple power grids would lead to a potentially dangerous  maze of wires  Clearly not all monopolies are in a position to make significant economic  profits  Regulators such as public utility commissions in the United States attempt to  determine what a normal return for the monopoly owners  investment should be and they set  prices accordingly  Nevertheless monopolists attempt to maximize profits 
5,125,Not all monopolies originate from  natural  barriers  For some monopolists barriers to entry do  not derive from increasing returns to scale  We mentioned that marketing and brand loyalty are  sources of product differentiation in monopolistic competition  In some highly successful cases  strong brand loyalty can become a formidable barrier to entry  For example if the Swiss  watchmaker Rolex is unusually successful in establishing brand loyalty so that its customers  think there is no close substitute for its product then the company will have monopoly like  pricing power over its market

2,126,The final potential source of market power is the increasing returns associated with network  effects  Network effects result from synergies related to increasing market penetration  By  achieving a critical level of adoption Microsoft was able to extend its market power through the  network effect for example because most computer users know how to use Microsoft Word   Therefore for firms Word is cheaper to adopt than other programs because almost every new  hire will be proficient in using the software and will need no further training  At some level of  market share a network based product or service  think of Facebook or eBay  reaches a point  where each additional share point increases the probability that another user will adopt    These  network effects increase the value to other potential adopters  In Microsoft s case the network  effects crowded out other potential competitors including Netscape s internet browser that  might have led to applications bypassing Windows  Eventually Microsoft s operating system s  market share reached    percent of the global market  Similar situations occur in financial  markets  If a publicly listed share or a derivative contract is more frequently traded on a certain  exchange market participants wishing to sell or buy the security will go to the more liquid  exchange because they expect to find a better price and faster execution there 
3,126,     Demand Analysis in Monopoly Markets
4,126,The monopolist s demand schedule is the aggregate demand for the product in the relevant  market  Because of the income effect and the substitution effect demand is negatively related to  price as usual  The slope of the demand curve is negative and therefore downward sloping  The  general form of the demand relationship is
5,126,QD   a   bP      or rewritten      P   a b      b QD
6,126,Therefore total revenue   TR   P   Q    a b  QD      b  Q 
7,126,D
8,126,Marginal revenue is the change in revenue given a change in the quantity demanded  Because  an increase in quantity requires a lower price the marginal revenue schedule is steeper than the  demand schedule  If the demand schedule is linear then the marginal revenue curve is twice as  steep as the demand schedule   
9,126,MR    TR  Q    a b       b QD
10,126,The demand and marginal revenue relationship is expressed in Exhibit

8,127,     Supply Analysis in Monopoly Markets
9,127,A monopolist s supply analysis is based on the firm s cost structure  As in the market structures  of monopolistic competition and oligopoly the monopolist does not have a well defined supply  function that determines the optimal output level and the price to charge  The optimal output is  the profit maximizing output level  The profit maximizing level of output occurs where  marginal revenue equals marginal cost MR   MC

2,129,MONOPOLISTS AND THEIR INCENTIVES
3,129,In theoretical models which usually take product quality and technology as given  monopolists can choose to vary either price or quantity  In real life they also have the  ability to vary their product 
4,129,A monopolist can choose to limit quality if producing a higher quality product is costly  and higher quality does not increase profits accordingly  For example the quality of  domestically produced cars in most developed countries improved dramatically once  foreign imports became more available  Before the opening of borders to foreign  imports the single incumbent that dominated the market  for example Fiat in Italy  or  the small group of incumbents acting as a collusive oligopoly  such as the Detroit  Big  Three  in the United States  were the effective monopolists of their domestic automobile  markets  Rust corrosion limited reliability and poor gas mileage were common   
5,129,Similarly regulated utilities may have limited incentives to innovate  Several studies  including G mez Ib  ez        have found that state owned and other monopoly  telephone utilities tended to provide very poor service before competition was  introduced  Poor service may not be limited to poor connection quality but may also  include extensive delays in adding new users and limited introduction of new services  such as caller ID or automatic answering services 
6,129,Intuitively a monopolist will not spend resources on quality control research and  development or even customer relations unless there is a threat of entry of a new  competitor or unless there is a clear link between such expenses and a profit increase  In  contrast in competitive markets including oligopoly innovation and quality are often  ways to differentiate the product and increase profits 
7,129,     Optimal Price and Output in Monopoly Markets
8,129,Continuing the natural gas example from above the total profit function can be solved using the  quadratic formula    Another method to solve the profit function is to evaluate     QD and set  it equal to zero  This identifies the point at which profit is unaffected by changes in output    Of  course this will give the same result as we found by equating marginal revenue with marginal  cost  The monopoly will maximize profits when Q       units of output and the price is set  from the demand curve at     
9,129,P                      per unit
10,129,To find total maximum profits substitute these values into the profit function above

2,130,Note that the price and output combination that maximizes profit occurs in the elastic portion of  the demand curve in Exhibit     This must be so because marginal revenue and marginal cost  will always intersect where marginal revenue is positive  This fact implies that quantity  demanded responds more than proportionately to prices changes i e  demand is elastic at the  point at which MC   MR  As noted earlier the relationship between marginal revenue and price  elasticity EP is 
3,130,MR   P       EP 
4,130,In monopoly MR   MC  therefore
5,130,P       EP    MC
6,130,The firm can use this relationship to determine the profit maximizing price if the firm knows its  cost structure and the price elasticity of demand EP  For example assume the firm knows that  its marginal cost is constant at    and recent market analysis indicates that price elasticity is  estimated to be      The optimal price is solved as
7,130,P                 and
8,130,P      
9,130,Exhibit    indicated that the monopolist wants to produce at QE and charge the price of PE   Suppose this is a natural monopoly that is operating as a government franchise under regulation   Natural monopolies are usually found where production is based on significant economies of  scale and declining cost structure in the market  Examples include electric power generation  natural gas distribution and the water and sewer industries  These are often called public  utilities  Exhibit    illustrates such a market in long run equilibrium

2,131,In Exhibit    three possible pricing and output solutions are presented  The first is what the  monopolist would do without regulation  The monopolist would seek to maximize profits by  producing QM units of the product where long run marginal cost equals marginal revenue  LRMC   MR  To maximize profits the monopolist would raise the price to the level the  demand curve will accept PM 
3,131,In perfect competition the price and output equilibrium occurs where price is equal to the  marginal cost of producing the incremental unit of the product  In a competitive market the  quantity produced would be higher QC and the price lower PC  For this regulated monopoly  the competitive solution would be unfair because at output QC the price PC would not cover the  average cost of production  One possibility is to subsidize the difference between the long run  average cost LRAC and the competitive price PC for each unit sold 
4,131,Another solution is for the regulator to set the price at the point where long run average cost  equals average revenue  Recall that the demand curve represents the average revenue the firm  receives at each output level  The government regulator will attempt to determine the  monopolistic firm s long run average cost and set the output and price so that the firm receives  a fair return on the owners  invested capital  The regulatory solution is output level QR with the  price set at PR  Therefore the regulatory solution is found between the unregulated monopoly  equilibrium and the competitive equilibrium

6,131,Monopolists can be more or less effective in taking advantage of their market structure  At one  extreme we have a monopolist that charges prices and supplies quantities that are the same as  they would be in perfect competition  this scenario may be a result of regulation or threat of  entry  if the monopolist charged more another company could come in and price the former  monopolist out of the market   At the opposite extreme hated by all consumers and economists  is the monopolist that extracts the entire consumer surplus  This scenario is called first degree  price discrimination where a monopolist is able to charge each customer the highest price the  customer is willing to pay  This is called price discrimination because the monopolist charges a  different price to each client  How can this be  For example if the monopolist knows the exact  demand schedule of the customer then the monopolist is able to capture the entire consumer  surplus  In practice the monopolist is able to measure how often the product is used and  charges the customer the highest price the consumer is willing to pay for that unit of good   Another possibility is that public price disclosure is non existent so that no customer knows  what the other customers are paying  Interestingly not every consumer is worse off in this case  because some consumers may be charged a price that is below that of perfect competition as  long as the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost 
7,131,In second degree price discrimination the monopolist offers a menu of quantity based  pricing options designed to induce customers to self select based on how highly they value the  product  Such mechanisms include volume discounts volume surcharges coupons product  bundling and restrictions on use  In practice producers can use not just the quantity but also the  quality  e g   professional grade   to charge more to customers that value the product highly

2,132,Third degree price discrimination happens when customers are segregated by demographic  or other traits  For example some econometric software is licensed this way  A student version  can handle only small datasets and is sold for a low price  a professional version can handle  very large datasets and is sold at a much higher price because corporations need to compute the  estimates for their business and are therefore willing to pay more for a license  Another example  is that airlines know that passengers who want to fly somewhere and come back the same day  are most likely business people  therefore one day roundtrip tickets are generally more  expensive than tickets with a return flight at a later date or over a weekend 
3,132,Price discrimination has many practical applications when the seller has pricing power  The best  way to understand how this concept works is to think of consumer surplus  As seen in this  reading a consumer may be willing to pay more for the first unit of a good but to buy a second  unit she will want to pay a lower price thus getting a better deal on the first unit  In practice  sellers can sometimes use income and substitution effects to their advantage  Think of  something you often buy perhaps lunch at your favorite caf   How much would you be willing  to pay for a  lunch club membership card  that would allow you to purchase lunches at say  half price  If the caf  could extract from you the maximum amount each month that you would  be willing to pay for the half price option then it would successfully have removed the income  effect from you in the form of a monthly fixed fee  Notice that a downward sloping demand  curve implies that you would end up buying more lunches each month than before you  purchased the discount card even though you would be no better or worse off than before  This  is a way that sellers are sometimes able to extract consumer surplus by means of creative  pricing schemes  It s a common practice among big box retailers sports clubs and other users  of what is called  two part tariff pricing  as in the example below 
4,132,EXAMPLE  
5,132,Price Discrimination
6,132,Nicole s monthly demand for visits to her health club is given by the following  equation  QD         P where QD is visits per month and P is euros per visit  The health  club s marginal cost is fixed at    per visit 
7,132,   Draw Nicole s demand curve for health club visits per month 
8,132,   If the club charged a price per visit equal to its marginal cost how many visits  would Nicole make per month 
9,132,   How much consumer surplus would Nicole enjoy at that price 
10,132,   How much could the club charge Nicole each month for a membership fee 
11,132,Solution to   
12,132,QD         P so when P     QD       Inverting P           QD so when Q     P     
13,132,Solution to   
14,132,QD                   Nicole would make    visits per month at a price of    per visit

2,133,Solution to   
3,133,Nicole s consumer surplus can be measured as the area under her demand curve and  above the price she pays for a total of    visits or                    Nicole would enjoy  a consumer surplus of     per month 
4,133,Solution to   
5,133,The club could extract all of Nicole s consumer surplus by charging her a monthly  membership fee of     plus a per visit price of     This pricing method is called a two  part tariff because it assesses one price per unit of the item purchased plus a per month  fee  sometimes called an  entry fee   equal to the buyer s consumer surplus evaluated at  the per unit price 
6,133,     Factors Affecting Long Run Equilibrium in Monopoly  Markets
7,133,The unregulated monopoly market structure can produce economic profits in the long run  In  the long run all factors of production are variable while in the short run some factors of  production are fixed  Generally the short run factor that is fixed is the capital investment such  as the factory machinery production technology available arable land and so forth  The long  run solution allows for all inputs including technology to change  In order to maintain a  monopoly market position in the long run the firm must be protected by substantial and  ongoing barriers to entry  If the monopoly position is the result of a patent then new patents  must be continuously added to prevent the entry of other firms into the market 
8,133,For regulated monopolies such as natural monopolies there are a variety of long run solutions   One solution is to set the price equal to marginal cost P   MC  However that price will not  likely be high enough to cover the average cost of production as Exhibit    illustrated  The  answer is to provide a subsidy sufficient to compensate the firm  The national rail system in the  United States Amtrak is an example of a regulated monopoly operating with a government  subsidy 
9,133,National ownership of the monopoly is another solution  Nationalization of the natural  monopoly has been a popular solution in Europe and other parts of the world  The United States  has generally avoided this potential solution  One problem with this arrangement is that once a  price is established consumers are unwilling to accept price increases even as factor costs  increase  Politically raising prices on products from government owned enterprises is highly  unpopular 
10,133,Establishing a governmental entity that regulates an authorized monopoly is another popular  solution  Exhibit    illustrated the appropriate decision rule  The regulator sets price equal to  long run average cost PR   LRAC  This solution assures that investors will receive a normal  return for the risk they are taking in the market  Given that no other competitors are allowed  the risk is lower than in a highly competitive market environment  The challenge facing the  regulator is determining the authentic risk related return and the monopolist s realistic long run  average cost

2,134,The final solution is to franchise the monopolistic firm through a bidding war  Again the public  goal is to select the winning firm based on price equaling long run average cost  Retail outlets  at rail stations and airports and concession outlets at stadiums are examples of government  franchises  The long run success of the monopoly franchise depends on its ability to meet the  goal of pricing its products at the level of its long run average cost 
3,134,EXAMPLE  
4,134,Monopolies and Efficiency
5,134,Are monopolies always inefficient 
6,134,A  No because if they charge more than average cost they are nationalized 
7,134,B  Yes because they charge all consumers more than perfectly competitive markets  would 
8,134,C  No because economies of scale and regulation  or threat of entry  may give a  better outcome for buyers than perfect competition 
9,134,Solution 
10,134,C is correct  Economies of scale and regulation may make monopolies more efficient  than perfect competition 
11,134,   IDENTIFICATION OF MARKET STRUCTURE
12,134,Monopoly markets and other situations where companies have pricing power can be inefficient  because producers constrain output to cause an increase in prices  Therefore there will be less  of the good being consumed and it will be sold at a higher price which is generally inefficient  for the market as a whole  This is why competition law regulates the degree of market  competition in several industries of different countries 
13,134,Market power in the real world is not always as clear as it is in textbook examples   Governments and regulators often have the difficult task of measuring market power and  establishing whether a firm has a dominant position that may resemble a monopoly  For  example in the     s US regulators prosecuted agricultural corporation Archer Daniels  Midland for conspiring with Japanese competitors to fix the price of lysine an amino acid used  as an animal feed additive  The antitrust action resulted in a settlement that involved over  US     million in fines paid by the cartel members  Another example occurred in the     s  when US antitrust authorities broke up the local telephone monopoly leaving AT T the long  distance business  and opening that business to competitors  and required AT T to divest itself  of the local telephone companies it owned  This antitrust decision brought competition  innovation and lower prices to the US telephone market

2,135,European regulators  specifically the European Commission  have affected the mergers and  monopoly positions of European corporations  as in the case of the companies Roche Rhone  Poulenc and BASF which were at the center of a vitamin price fixing case  as well as non  European companies  such as Intel  that do business in Europe  Moreover the merger between  the US company General Electric and the European company Honeywell was denied by the  European Commission on grounds of excessive market concentration 
3,135,Quantifying excessive market concentration is difficult  Sometimes regulators need to measure  whether something that has not yet occurred might generate excessive market power  For  example a merger between two companies might allow the combined company to be a  monopolist or quasi monopolist in a certain market 
4,135,A financial analyst hearing news about a possible merger should always consider the impact of  competition law  sometimes called antitrust law  that is whether a proposed merger may be  blocked by regulators in the interest of preserving a competitive market 
5,135,     Econometric Approaches
6,135,How should one measure market power  The theoretical answer is to estimate the elasticity of  demand and supply in a market  If demand is very elastic the market must be very close to  perfect competition  If demand is rigid  inelastic  companies may have market power  This is  the approach taken in the cellophane case mentioned in Section       
7,135,From the econometric point of view this estimation requires some attention  The problem is  that observed price and quantity are the equilibrium values of price and quantity and do not  represent the value of either supply or demand  Technically this is called the problem of  endogeneity in the sense that the equilibrium price and quantity are jointly determined by the  interaction of demand and supply  Therefore to have an appropriate estimation of demand and  supply we will need to use a model with two equations namely an equation of demanded  quantity  as a function of price income of the buyers and other variables  and an equation of  supplied quantity  as a function of price production costs and other variables   The estimated  parameters will then allow us to compute elasticity 
8,135,Regression analysis is useful in computing elasticity but requires a large number of  observations  Therefore one may use a time series approach and for example look at    years  of quarterly sales data for a market  However the market structure may have changed radically  over those    years and the estimated elasticity may not apply to the current situation   Moreover the supply curve may change as a result of a merger among large competitors and  the estimation based on past data may not be informative regarding the future state of the  market post merger 
9,135,An alternative approach is a cross sectional regression analysis  Instead of looking at total sales  and average prices in a market over time  the time series approach mentioned above  we can  look at sales from different companies in the market during the same year or even at single  transactions from many buyers and companies  Clearly this approach requires substantial data  gathering effort and therefore this estimation method can be complicated  Moreover different  specifications of the explanatory variables  for example using total GDP rather than median  household income or per capita GDP to represent income  may sometimes lead to dramatically  different estimates

2,136,     Simpler Measures
3,136,Trying to avoid the above drawbacks analysts often use simpler measures to estimate elasticity   The simplest measure is the concentration ratio which is the sum of the market shares of the  largest N firms  To compute this ratio one would for example add the sales values of the  largest    firms and divide this figure by total market sales  This number is always between  zero  perfect competition  and     percent  monopoly  
4,136,The main advantage of the concentration ratio is that it is simple to compute as shown above   The disadvantage is that it does not directly quantify market power  In other words is a high  concentration ratio a clear signal of monopoly power  The analysis of entry in Section    explains clearly that this is not the case  A company may be the only incumbent in a market but  if the barriers to entry are low the simple presence of a potential entrant may be sufficient to  convince the incumbent to behave like a firm in perfect competition  For example a sugar  wholesaler may be the only one in a country but the knowledge that other large wholesalers in  the food industry might easily add imported sugar to their range of products should convince  the sugar wholesaler to price its product as if it were in perfect competition 
5,136,Another disadvantage of the concentration ratio is that it tends to be unaffected by mergers  among the top market incumbents  For example if the largest and second largest incumbents  merge the pricing power of the combined entity is likely to be larger than that of the two pre  existing companies  But the concentration ratio may not change much 
6,136,CALCULATING THE CONCENTRATION RATIO
7,136,Suppose there are eight producers of a certain good in a market  The largest producer  has    percent of the market the second largest has    percent the third has    percent  the fourth has    percent and the remaining four have     percent each  If we computed  the concentration ratio of the top three producers it would be                   percent  while the concentration ratio of the top four producers would be                         percent 
8,136,If the two largest companies merged the new concentration ratio for the top three  producers would be     the sum of the market shares of the merged companies                  percent and the concentration ratio for the four top producers would be       percent  Therefore this merger affects the concentration ratio very mildly even though  it creates a substantial entity that controls    percent of the market 
9,136,For example the effect of consolidation in the US retail gasoline market has resulted in  increasing degrees of concentration  In      the top four companies in the US retail  gasoline market shared    percent of the market  By      the top four companies  controlled    percent of the market  Exxon Mobil    percent Shell    percent  BP Amoco Arco    percent and Chevron Texaco    percent  
10,136,To avoid the known issues with concentration ratios economists O C  Herfindahl and A O   Hirschman suggested an index where the market shares of the top N companies are first squared  and then added  If one firm controls the whole market  a monopoly  the Herfindahl Hirschman  index  HHI  equals    If there are M firms in the industry with equal market shares then the  HHI equals    M   This provides a useful gauge for interpreting an HHI  For example an HHI  of      would be analogous to having the market shared equally by   firms

2,137,The HHI for the top three companies in the example in the box above would be                                before the merger while after the merger it would be                                which is substantially higher than the initial        This is why the HHI is widely used  by competition regulators  However just like the concentration ratio the HHI does not take the  possibility of entry into account nor does it consider the elasticity of demand  As a  consequence the HHI has limited use for a financial analyst trying to estimate the potential  profitability of a company or group of companies 
3,137,EXAMPLE  
4,137,The Herfindahl Hirschman Index
5,137,Suppose a market has    suppliers each of them with    percent of the market  What  are the concentration ratio and the HHI of the top four firms 
6,137,A  Concentration ratio   percent and HHI   
7,137,B  Concentration ratio    percent and HHI    
8,137,C  Concentration ratio    percent and HHI     
9,137,Solution 
10,137,C is correct  The concentration ratio for the top four firms is                         percent and the HHI is                             
11,137,SUMMARY
12,137,In this reading we have surveyed how economists classify market structures  We have analyzed  the distinctions between the different structures that are important for understanding demand  and supply relations optimal price and output and the factors affecting long run profitability   We also provided guidelines for identifying market structure in practice  Among our  conclusions are the following 
13,137,  Economic market structures can be grouped into four categories  perfect competition  monopolistic competition oligopoly and monopoly 
14,137,  The categories differ because of the following characteristics  The number of producers is  many in perfect and monopolistic competition few in oligopoly and one in monopoly   The degree of product differentiation the pricing power of the producer the barriers to  entry of new producers and the level of non price competition  e g  advertising  are all  low in perfect competition moderate in monopolistic competition high in oligopoly and  generally highest in monopoly

2,138,  A financial analyst must understand the characteristics of market structures in order to  better forecast a firm s future profit stream 
3,138,  The optimal marginal revenue equals marginal cost  However only in perfect  competition does the marginal revenue equal price  In the remaining structures price  generally exceeds marginal revenue because a firm can sell more units only by reducing  the per unit price 
4,138,  The quantity sold is highest in perfect competition  The price in perfect competition is  usually lowest but this depends on factors such as demand elasticity and increasing  returns to scale  which may reduce the producer s marginal cost   Monopolists  oligopolists and producers in monopolistic competition attempt to differentiate their  products so that they can charge higher prices 
5,138,  Typically monopolists sell a smaller quantity at a higher price  Investors may benefit  from being shareholders of monopolistic firms that have large margins and substantial  positive cash flows 
6,138,  Competitive firms do not earn economic profit  There will be a market compensation for  the rental of capital and of management services but the lack of pricing power implies  that there will be no extra margins 
7,138,  While in the short run firms in any market structure can have economic profits the more  competitive a market is and the lower the barriers to entry the faster the extra profits will  fade  In the long run new entrants shrink margins and push the least efficient firms out of  the market 
8,138,  Oligopoly is characterized by the importance of strategic behavior  Firms can change the  price quantity quality and advertisement of the product to gain an advantage over their  competitors  Several types of equilibrium  e g  Nash Cournot kinked demand curve   may occur that affect the likelihood of each of the incumbents  and potential entrants in  the long run  having economic profits  Price wars may be started to force weaker  competitors to abandon the market 
9,138,  Measuring market power is complicated  Ideally econometric estimates of the elasticity  of demand and supply should be computed  However because of the lack of reliable data  and the fact that elasticity changes over time  so that past data may not apply to the  current situation  regulators and economists often use simpler measures  The  concentration ratio is simple but the HHI with little more computation required often  produces a better figure for decision making

2,145,C  monopolistic competition 
3,145,SOLUTIONS
4,145,   C is correct  Monopolistic competition is characterized by many sellers differentiated  products and some pricing power 
5,145,   A is correct  Few sellers of a homogeneous or standardized product characterizes an  oligopoly 
6,145,   B is correct  The product produced in a perfectly competitive market cannot be  differentiated by advertising or any other means 
7,145,   C is correct  Profits are maximized when MR   MC  For a monopoly MR   P       Ep    Setting this equal to MC and solving for P 
8,145,      P                P        
9,145,P       
10,145,   B is correct  The long run competitive equilibrium occurs where MC   AC   P for each  company  Equating MC and AC implies      Q       Q        Q 
11,145,Solving for Q gives Q      Equating MC with price gives P        Q       Any price  above    yields an economic profit because P   MC   AC so new companies will enter  the market 
12,145,   B is correct  A company in a perfectly competitive market must accept whatever price the  market dictates  The marginal cost schedule of a company in a perfectly competitive  market determines its supply function 
13,145,   A is correct  As prices decrease smaller companies will leave the market rather than sell  below cost  The market share of Aquarius the price leader will increase 
14,145,   C is correct  In the Nash model each company considers the other s reaction in selecting  its strategy  In equilibrium neither company has an incentive to change its strategy   ThetaTech is better off with open architecture regardless of what SigmaSoft decides   Given this choice SigmaSoft is better off with a proprietary platform  Neither company  will change its decision unilaterally 
15,145,   C is correct  The profit maximizing choice is the level of output where marginal revenue  equals marginal cost 
16,145,    A is correct  The oligopolist faces two different demand structures one for price  increases and another for price decreases  Competitors will lower prices to match a price  reduction but will not match a price increase  The result is a kinked demand curve 
17,145,    B is correct  When companies have similar market shares competitive forces tend to  outweigh the benefits of collusion

2,146,    B is correct  The economic profit will attract new entrants to the market and encourage  existing companies to expand capacity 
3,146,    B is correct  The dominant company s market share tends to decrease as profits attract  entry by other companies 
4,146,    B is correct  This allows the investors to receive a normal return for the risk they are  taking in the market 
5,146,    B is correct  The top four companies in the industry comprise    percent of industry  sales

7,146,    B is correct  The Herfindahl Hirschmann Index does not reflect low barriers to entry that  may restrict the market power of companies currently in the market 
8,146,    B is correct  The credible threat of entry holds down prices and multiple incumbents are  offering undifferentiated products 
9,146,    C is correct  There are many competitors in the market but some product differentiation  exists as the price differential between Deep River s brand and the house brands  indicates

5,149,   INTRODUCTION
6,149,In the field of economics microeconomics is the study of the economic activity and behavior of  individual economic units such as a household a company or a market for a particular good or  service and macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate activities of households companies  and markets  Macroeconomics focuses on national aggregates such as total investment the  amount spent by all businesses on plant and equipment  total consumption the amount spent by  all households on goods and services  the rate of change in the general level of prices  and the  overall level of interest rates 
7,149,Macroeconomic analysis examines a nation s aggregate output and income its competitive and  comparative advantages the productivity of its labor force its price level and inflation rate and  the actions of its national government and central bank  The objective of macroeconomic  analysis is to address such fundamental questions as 
8,149,  What is an economy s aggregate output and how is aggregate income measured 
9,149,  What factors determine the level of aggregate output income for an economy 
10,149,  What are the levels of aggregate demand and aggregate supply of goods and services  within the country 
11,149,  Is the level of output increasing or decreasing and at what rate 
12,149,  Is the general price level stable rising or falling 
13,149,  Is unemployment rising or falling 
14,149,  Are households spending or saving more 
15,149,  Are workers able to produce more output for a given level of inputs 
16,149,  Are businesses investing in and expanding their productive capacity 
17,149,  Are exports  imports  rising or falling

2,150,From an investment perspective investors must be able to evaluate a country s current  economic environment and to forecast its future economic environment in order to identify  asset classes and securities that will benefit from economic trends occurring within that country   Macroeconomic variables such as the level of inflation unemployment consumption  government spending and investment affect the overall level of activity within a country   They also have different impacts on the growth and profitability of industries within a country  the companies within those industries and the returns of the securities issued by those  companies 
3,150,This reading is organized as follows  Section   describes gross domestic product and related  measures of domestic output and income  Section   discusses short run and long run aggregate  demand and supply curves the causes of shifts and movements along those curves and factors  that affect equilibrium levels of output prices and interest rates  Section   discusses sources  sustainability and measures of economic growth  A summary and practice problems complete  the reading 
4,150,   AGGREGATE OUTPUT AND INCOME
5,150,The aggregate output of an economy is the value of all the goods and services produced in a  specified period of time  The aggregate income of an economy is the value of all the  payments earned by the suppliers of factors used in the production of goods and services   Because the value of the output produced must accrue to the factors of production aggregate  output and aggregate income within an economy must be equal 
6,150,There are four broad forms of payments  i e  income   compensation of employees rent  interest and profits  Compensation of employees includes wages and benefits  primarily  employer contributions to private pension plans and health insurance  that individuals receive in  exchange for providing labor  Rent is payment for the use of property  Interest is payment for  lending funds  Profit is the return that owners of a company receive for the use of their capital  and the assumption of financial risk when making their investments  Although businesses are  the direct owners of much of the property and physical capital in the economy by virtue of  owning the businesses households are the ultimate owners of these assets and hence the  ultimate recipients of the profits  In reality of course a portion of profits are usually retained  within businesses to help finance maintenance and expansion of capacity  Similarly because the  government is viewed as operating on a non profit basis any revenue it receives from  ownership of companies and or property may be viewed as being passed back to households in  the form of lower taxes  Therefore for simplicity it is standard in macroeconomics to attribute  all income to the household sector unless the analysis depends on a more precise accounting 
7,150,Aggregate expenditure the total amount spent on the goods and services produced in the   domestic  economy during the period must also be equal to aggregate output and aggregate  income  However some of this expenditure may come from foreigners in the form of net  exports   Thus aggregate output aggregate income and aggregate expenditure all refer to  different ways of decomposing the same quantity

2,151,Exhibit   illustrates the flow of inputs output income and expenditures in a very simple  economy  Households supply the factors of production  labor and capital  to businesses in  exchange for wages and profit  aggregate income  totaling       These flows are shown by the  top two arrows  Companies use the inputs to produce goods and services  aggregate output   which they sell to households  aggregate expenditure  for       The output and expenditure  flows are shown by the bottom two arrows  Aggregate output income and expenditure are all  equal to      
3,151,In this simplified example households spend all of their income on domestically produced  goods and services  They do not buy foreign goods save for the future or pay taxes  Similarly  businesses do not sell to foreigners or the government and do not invest to increase their  productive capacity  These important components of the economy will be added in Section       But first we need to discuss how output and income are measured 
4,151,Exhibit    Output Income and Expenditure in a Simple Economy  The  Circular Flow
5,151,     Gross Domestic Product
6,151,Gross domestic product  GDP  measures
7,151,  the market value of all final goods and services produced within the economy in a given  period of time  output definition  or equivalently
8,151,  the aggregate income earned by all households all companies and the government within  the economy in a given period of time  income definition  
9,151,Intuitively GDP measures the flow of output and income in the economy   GDP represents the  broadest measure of the value of economic activity occurring within a country during a given  period of time

2,152,Therefore GDP can be determined in two different manners  In the income approach GDP is  calculated as the total amount earned by households and companies in the economy  In the  expenditure approach GDP is calculated as the total amount spent on the goods and services  produced within the economy during a given period  For the economy as a whole total income  must equal total expenditures so the two approaches yield the same result 
3,152,Many developed countries use a standardized methodology for measuring GDP  This  methodology is described in the official handbook of the Organisation for Economic Co  Operation and Development  Paris  OECD Publishing   The OECD reports the national  accounts for many developed nations  In the United States the National Income and Product  Accounts  also called NIPA or national accounts for short  is the official US government  accounting of all the income and expenditure flows in the US economy  The national accounts  are the responsibility of the US Department of Commerce and are published in its Survey of  Current Business  In Canada similar data are available from Statistics Canada whereas in  China the National Bureau of Statistics of China provides GDP data 
4,152,To ensure that GDP is measured consistently over time and across countries the following three  broad criteria are used 
5,152,  All goods and services included in the calculation of GDP must be produced during the  measurement period  Therefore items produced in previous periods such as houses  cars machinery or equipment are excluded  In addition transfer payments from the  government sector to individuals such as unemployment compensation or welfare  benefits are excluded  Capital gains that accrue to individuals when their assets  appreciate in value are also excluded 
6,152,  The only goods and services included in the calculation of GDP are those whose value  can be determined by being sold in the market  This enables the price of goods or services  to be objectively determined  For example a liter of extra virgin olive oil is more  valuable than a liter of spring water because the market price of extra virgin olive oil is  higher than the market price of spring water  The value of labor used in activities that are  not sold on the market such as commuting gardening etc  is also excluded from GDP   By products of production processes are also excluded if they have no explicit market  value such as air pollution water pollution and acid rain 
7,152,  Only the market value of final goods and services is included in GDP  Final goods and  services are those that are not resold  Intermediate goods are goods that are resold or used  to produce another good   The value of intermediate goods is excluded from GDP  because additional value is added during the production process and all the value added  during the entire production process is reflected in the final sale price of the finished  good  An alternative approach to measuring GDP is summing all the value added during  the production and distribution processes  The most direct approach however is to sum  the market value of all the final goods and services produced within the economy in a  given time period

2,153,Two distinct but closely related measurement methods can be used to calculate GDP based on  expenditures  value of final output and sum of value added  These two methods are illustrated in  Exhibit    In this example a farmer sells wheat to a miller  The miller grinds the wheat into  flour and sells it to a baker who makes bread and sells it to a retailer  Finally the bread is sold  to retail customers  The wheat and flour are both intermediate goods in this example because  they are used as inputs to produce another good  Thus they are not counted  directly  in GDP   For the purposes of GDP the value of the final product is       which includes the value added  by the bread retailer as a distributor of the bread  If in contrast the baker sold directly to the  public the value counted in GDP would be the price at which the baker sold the bread         The left column of the exhibit shows the total revenue received at each stage of the process  whereas the right column shows the value added at each stage  Note that the market value of the  final product         is equal to the sum of the value added at each of the stages  Thus the  contribution to GDP can be measured as either the final sale price or the sum of the value added  at each stage

2,154,Contribution of Automobile Production to  GDP
3,154,Exhibit   provides simplified information on the cost of producing an automobile in the  United States at various stages of the production process  The example assumes the  automobile is produced and sold domestically and assumes no imported material is used   Calculate the contribution of automobile production to GDP using the value added  method and show that it is equivalent to the expenditure method  What impact would  the use of imported steel or plastics have on GDP

13,154,Solution 
14,154,GDP includes only the value of final goods and ignores intermediate goods in order to  avoid double counting  Thus the final sale price of        and not the total sales value  of         summing sales at all the levels of production  would be included in GDP   Alternatively we can avoid double counting by calculating and summing the value  added at each stage  At each stage of production the difference between what a  company pays for its inputs and what it receives for the product is its contribution to  GDP  The value added for each stage of production is computed as follows 
15,154,Stage of Production    Production of basic materials

20,155,Thus the sum of the value added by each stage of production is equal to        which  is equal to the final selling price of the automobile  If some of the inputs  steel plastics  or semiconductors  are imported the value added would be reduced by the amount paid  for the imports 
21,155,       Goods and Services Included at Imputed Values
22,155,As a general rule only the value of goods and services whose value can be determined by being  sold in the market are included in the measurement of GDP  Owner occupied housing and  government services however are two examples of services that are not sold in the marketplace  but are still included in the measurement of GDP 
23,155,When a household  individual  rents a place to live he or she is buying housing services  The  household pays the owner of the property rent in exchange for shelter  The income that a  property owner receives is included in the calculation of GDP  However when a household  purchases a home it is implicitly paying itself in exchange for the shelter  As a result the  government must estimate  impute  a value for this owner occupied rent which is then added to  GDP 
24,155,The value of government services provided by police officers firemen judges and other  government officials is a key factor that affects the level of economic activity  However  valuing these services is difficult because they are not sold in a market like other services   individual customers cannot decide how much to consume or how much they are willing to pay   Therefore these services are simply included in GDP at their cost  e g  wages paid  with no  value added attributed to the production process

2,156,For simplicity and global comparability the number of goods and services with imputed values  that are included in the measurement of GDP are limited  In general non market activity is  excluded from GDP  Thus activities performed for one s own benefit such as cooking  cleaning and home repair are excluded  Activities in the so called underground economy are  also excluded  The underground economy reflects economic activity that people hide from the  government either because it is illegal or because they are attempting to evade taxation   Undocumented laborers who are paid  off the books  are one example  The illegal drug trade is  another   Similarly barter transactions such as neighbors exchanging services with each other   for example helping your neighbor repair her fence in exchange for her plowing your garden   are excluded from GDP 
3,156,Exhibit   shows the estimated size of the underground economy in various countries as a  percentage of nominal GDP  The estimates range from   percent in the United States to     percent in Peru  Based on these estimates the US national income accounts fail to account for  roughly     percent           of economic activity whereas in Peru the national accounts miss  roughly      percent            of the economy  For most of the countries shown the national  accounts miss       percent of the economy

8,156,It should be clear from these estimates of the underground economy that the reliability of  official GDP data varies considerably across countries  Failure to capture a significant portion  of activity is one problem  Poor data collection practices and unreliable statistical methods  within the official accounts are also potential problems

2,157,       Nominal and Real GDP
3,157,In order to evaluate an economy s health it is often useful to remove the effect of changes in  the general price level on GDP because higher  lower  income driven solely by changes in the  price level is not indicative of a higher  lower  level of economic activity  To accomplish this  economists use real GDP which indicates what would have been the total expenditures on the  output of goods and services if prices were unchanged  Per capita real GDP  real GDP  divided by the size of the population  has often been used as a measure of the average standard  of living in a country 
4,157,Suppose we are interested in measuring the GDP of an economy  For the sake of simplicity  suppose that the economy consists of a single automobile maker and that in              vehicles are produced with an average market price of         GDP in      would be               Economists define the value of goods and services measured at current prices  as nominal GDP  Suppose that in             vehicles are again produced but that the  average market price for a vehicle increases by   percent to            GDP in      would be               Even though no more cars were produced in      than in      it appears that  the economy grew by                                    between      and       although it actually did not grow at all 
5,157,Nominal and real GDP can be expressed as
6,157,Nominal GDPt   Pt   Qt
7,157,where
8,157,Pt   Prices in year t
9,157,Qt   Quantity produced in year t

18,157,In this example real GDP did not change between      and      because the total output  remained the same         vehicles  The difference between nominal GDP in      and real  GDP in      was the   percent inflation rate 
19,157,Now suppose that the auto manufacturer produced   percent more vehicles in      than in        i e  production in      was        vehicles   Real GDP would increase by   percent from       to       With a   percent increase in prices nominal GDP for      would now be

4,158,The implicit price deflator for GDP or simply the GDP deflator is defined as
5,158,GDP deflator  
6,158,Value of current year output at current year prices Value of current year output at base year prices
7,158,     
8,158,Thus in the example the GDP deflator for      is                                                                      The GDP deflator broadly measures the aggregate changes  in prices across the overall economy and hence changes in the deflator provide a useful gauge  of inflation within the economy 
9,158,Real GDP is equal to nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator scaled by     
10,158,Real GDP    Nominal GDP  GDP deflator      
11,158,This relation gives the GDP deflator its name  That is the measure of GDP in terms of current  prices nominal GDP is adjusted for inflation by dividing it by the deflator  The expression also  shows that the GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP scaled by     
12,158,GDP deflator    Nominal GDP Real GDP       
13,158,Thus real GDP for      would be
14,158,Real GDP        Nominal GDP  GDP deflator      
15,158,                         
16,158,             
17,158,Note that             represents   percent real growth over      GDP and   percent higher  real GDP for      than under the assumption of no growth in unit car sales in      
18,158,What would be the increase in nominal GDP for      compared with      with the   percent  greater automobile production and   percent inflation 
19,158, Nominal GDP     Nominal GDP         
20,158,                               
21,158,       
22,158,So nominal GDP would increase by      percent which equals                     or  approximately                Which number is more informative about growth in economic  activity   percent real growth or      percent nominal growth  The real growth rate is more  informative because it exactly captures increases in output  Nominal growth by blending price  changes with output changes is less directly informative about output changes  In summary  real economic growth is measured by the percentage change in real GDP  When measuring real  economic activity or when comparing one nation s economy to another real GDP and real GDP  growth should be used because they more closely reflect the quantity of output available for  consumption and investment

3,160,     The Components of GDP
4,160,Having defined GDP and discussed how it is measured we can now consider the major  components of GDP the flows among the four major sectors of the economy the household  sector the business sector the government sector and the foreign or external sector   comprising transactions with the  rest of the world   and the markets through which they  interact  An expression for GDP based on the expenditure approach is
5,160,Equation

2,161,       The Household and Business Sectors
3,161,The very top portion of Exhibit   shows the services of labor land and capital flowing through  the factor market to business firms and the flow of income back from firms to households   Households spend part of their income on consumption  C  and save  S  part of their income for  future consumption  Current consumption expenditure flows through the goods market to the  business sector  Household saving flows into the financial markets where it provides funding  for businesses that need to borrow or raise equity capital  Firms borrow or raise equity primarily  to finance investment  I  in inventory property plant and equipment  Investment  I  is shown  flowing from firms through the goods market and back to firms because the business sector  both demands and produces the goods needed to build productive capacity  capital goods  
4,161,In most developed economies like Italy and the United States expenditures on capital goods  represent a significant portion of GDP  Investments  expenditures  on capital goods accounted  for approximately      percent of Italy s GDP in      while in the United States investments  accounted for approximately      percent of GDP  In some developing countries notably China        percent  and India       percent  investment spending accounts for a substantially larger  share of the economy   As we will examine in greater detail later investment spending is an  important determinant of an economy s long term growth rate  At the same time investment  spending is the most volatile component of the economy and changes in capital spending  especially spending on inventories are one of the main factors causing short run economic  fluctuations

2,162,The government sector collects taxes from households and businesses  For simplicity only the  taxes collected from the household sector are shown in Exhibit    In turn the government sector  purchases goods and services  G  from the business sector  For example the government sector  hires construction companies to build roads schools and other infrastructure goods   Government expenditure  G  also reflects spending on the military police and fire protection  the postal service and other government services  Provision of these services makes the  government a major source of employment in most countries  To keep Exhibit   simple  however government employment and the corresponding income are not explicitly shown 
3,162,Governments also make transfer payments to households  In general these are designed to  address social objectives such as maintaining minimum living standards providing health care  and assisting the unemployed with retraining and temporary support  In Exhibit   transfer  payments are subtracted from taxes and reflected in net taxes  T  
4,162,Transfer payments are not included in government expenditures on goods and services  G   because they represent a monetary transfer by the government of tax revenue back to  individuals with no corresponding receipt of goods or services  The household spending  facilitated by the transfer payments is of course included in consumption  C  and hence GDP   It is worth noting that transfers do not always take the form of direct payments to beneficiaries   Instead the government may pay for or even directly provide goods or services to individuals   For example universal health care programs often work in this way 
5,162,If as is usually the case government expenditure  G  exceeds net taxes  T  then the  government has a fiscal deficit and must borrow in the financial markets  Thus the government  may compete with businesses in the financial markets for the funds generated by household  saving  The only other potential source of funds in an economy is capital flows from the rest of  the world  These will be discussed in the next section 
6,162,In      the ratio of general government spending  which includes central government as well  as state provincial and local government  to GDP in Italy was      percent while in the United  States it was      percent  In countries where the government provides more services such as  universal health care in Italy the government s contribution to GDP is greater  France s  government sector represents      percent of GDP  In other countries the public sector makes  up a smaller share  For example in Costa Rica which has no standing army or navy  government spending is      percent of GDP  Exhibit   shows data on tax revenues general  government spending and transfer payments as a share of nominal GDP

20,163,Trade and capital flows involving the rest of the world are shown in the bottom right quadrant  of Exhibit    Net exports  X   M  reflects the difference between the value of goods and services  sold to foreigners exports  X  and the portion of domestic consumption  C  investment  I   and government expenditure  G  that represents purchases of goods and services from the rest  of the world imports  M  
21,163,A balance of trade deficit means that the domestic economy is spending more on foreign  goods and services than foreign economies are spending on domestic goods and services  It also  means that the country is spending more than it produces because domestic saving is not  sufficient to finance domestic investment plus the government s fiscal balance  A trade deficit  must be funded by borrowing from the rest of the world through the financial markets  The rest  of the world is able to provide this financing because by definition it must be running a  corresponding trade surplus and spending less than it produces 
22,163,It bears emphasizing that trade and capital flows between an economy and the rest of the world  must balance  One area s deficit is another s surplus and vice versa  This is an accounting  identity that must hold  In effect having allowed a country to run a trade deficit foreigners  must in aggregate finance it  However the financing terms may or may not be attractive

35,166,The exhibit shows the two approaches to measuring GDP     expenditures on final output  measured as the sum of sales to the final users and    the sum of the factor incomes generated in  the production of final output  In theory the two approaches should provide the same estimate  of GDP  As shown in the exhibit however in practice they differ because of the use of different  data sources  The difference is accounted for by a statistical discrepancy  Market analysts more  closely follow the expenditure approach because the expenditure data are more timely and  reliable than data for the income components  
36,166,Using the expenditure approach Statistics Canada measures Canadian GDP as follows 
37,166,GDP   Consumer spending on goods and services   Business gross fixed investment   Change in inventories   Government spending on goods and services   Government gross fixed investment   Exports   Imports   Statistical discrepancy
38,166,Note that the Canadian national income accounts classify a portion of government expenditures  as gross fixed investment  Not all countries make this distinction  The United States for  example does not  Also note that the change in business inventories must be included in  expenditures  Otherwise goods produced but not yet sold would be left out of GDP

2,167,The income based approach calculates GDP as the sum of factor incomes and essentially  measures the cost of producing final output  However two of the costs entering into the gross  value of output are not really earned by a factor of production  These items depreciation and  indirect taxes are discussed below  GDP is estimated in the income approach as follows  
3,167,GDP   National income   Capital consumption allowance   Statistical discrepancy
4,167,where national income is the income received by all factors of production used in the  generation of final output 
5,167,National income   Compensation of employees   Corporate and government enterprise profits before taxes   Interest income   Unincorporated business net income  proprietor s income    Rent   Indirect business taxes less subsidies
6,167,Compensation of employees includes wages and supplements to wages which are primarily  payments for pensions and health insurance  Corporate profits before taxes include three items      dividends paid to households    undistributed corporate profits  retained earnings  that  remain in the business sector and    corporate taxes paid to government  Interest income is the  interest paid by businesses to households government and foreigners to compensate them for  the loan of a financial asset  Unincorporated net income including rent is the earnings that flow  to unincorporated proprietors and farm operators for running their own business   Indirect  business taxes less subsidies  reflects taxes and subsidies included in the final price of the good  or service  It is the  net  portion of national income that is directly paid to the government  In  the Canadian accounts these are measured in two ways      taxes less subsidies on products   which includes sales taxes fuel taxes and import duties and     taxes less subsidies on factors  of production  which is mainly property taxes and payroll taxes 
7,167,The capital consumption allowance  CCA  is a measure of the wear and tear  depreciation   of the capital stock that occurs in the production of goods and services  This measure  acknowledges the fact that some income output must be allocated to replacement of the existing  capital stock as it wears out  Loosely speaking one may think of Profit   CCA as the total  amount earned by capital with the CCA being the amount that must be earned and reinvested  just to maintain the existing productivity of the capital 
8,167,Along with the GDP report Statistics Canada and other government statistical agencies provide  information on personal income and saving  Personal income is a broad measure of  household income and measures the ability of consumers to make purchases  As such it is one  of the key determinants of consumption spending  Personal income includes all income  received by households whether earned or unearned  It differs from national income in that  some of the income earned by the factors of production  indirect business taxes corporate  income taxes retained earnings  is not received by households and instead goes to the  government or business sectors  Similarly households receive some income from governments   transfer payments such as social insurance payments unemployment compensation and  disability payments  that is not earned  Thus the following adjustments are made to national  income in order to derive personal income

3,168,Personal disposable income  PDI  is equal to personal income less personal taxes  It  measures the amount of after tax income that households have to spend on goods and services  or to save  Thus it is the most relevant and most closely watched measure of income for  household spending and saving decisions 
4,168,Finally household saving is equal to PDI less three items  consumption expenditures interest  paid by consumers to business and personal transfer payments to foreigners  The corresponding  measure of saving for the business sector equals undistributed corporate profits plus the capital  consumption allowance

3,170,Household saving is equal to personal disposable income less three items  consumption  expenditures interest paid by consumers to business and personal transfer payments to  foreigners  Consumption  C  is given in Exhibit   as C         Substituting the  numbers saving  S                                     C       
4,170,The Canadian saving rate for                             
5,170,Net taxes paid by the household sector consists of two components     taxes paid by  households to the government minus    government transfer payments to households   From Exhibit   government transfer payments to households for      were C          The tax outlay for households in      is the difference between personal income and  personal disposable income  Therefore tax payments by households to government  equal
6,170,                   C       
7,170,Thus net taxes going to government  T  from the household sector is C         However personal taxes do not cover all sources of receipts for government   Government receipts also come from such sources as corporate income taxes indirect  taxes on businesses and consumers and contributions for social insurance  The total tax  receipts for all levels of government can be estimated from the deficit information  From  Exhibit   government spending for      totaled                    C          Therefore total tax revenue from all sources is equal to        minus       or  C        
8,170,Solution to   
9,170,The international sector had a large impact on the Canadian economy in       Exports  declined sharply by      percent going from C        in      to C        in        Imports declined from C        in      to C        in      a      percent  decrease  As a result the Canadian economy moved from a trade surplus of C       in       to a deficit of C       in       This huge swing in the trade balance had a very  significant negative impact on the Canadian economy and subtracted from GDP growth 
10,170,Canada funded the large trade deficit in      by borrowing C       from the rest of  the world through the financial markets  As discussed in Section       trade and capital  flows between an economy and the rest of the world must balance  A trade deficit must  be funded by a capital inflow 
11,170,Solution to   
12,170,Borrowing by the business sector depends on the level of saving in the sector  i e   internally generated funds  and the level of business investment in both fixed assets and  inventories  i e  the amount that must be financed   For      gross saving in the  business sector is equal to undistributed corporate profits         plus the capital  consumption allowance           Thus business saving is C         Because this  number exceeds business fixed and inventory investment of C                         the business sector was a net lender of funds totaling C

3,171,In this section we will build a model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and use it to  discuss how aggregate output and the level of prices are determined in the economy   Aggregate demand  AD  represents the quantity of goods and services that households  businesses government and foreign customers want to buy at any given level of prices   Aggregate supply  AS  represents the quantity of goods and services producers are willing to  supply at any given level of prices  It also reflects the amount of labor and capital that  households are willing to offer into the marketplace at given real wage rates and cost of capital 
4,171,     Aggregate Demand
5,171,As we will see the aggregate demand curve looks like the ordinary demand curves that we  encounter in microeconomics  quantity demanded increases as the price level declines  But our  intuitive understanding of that relationship lower price allows us to buy more of a good with a  given level of income does not apply here because income is not fixed  Instead aggregate  income expenditure is to be determined within the model along with the price level  Thus we  will need to explain the relationship between price and quantity demanded somewhat  differently 
6,171,The aggregate demand curve represents the combinations of aggregate income and the price  level at which two conditions are satisfied  First aggregate expenditure equals aggregate  income  As indicated in our discussion of GDP accounting this must always be true after the  fact  The new aspect here is the requirement that planned expenditure equal actual  or realized   income  To understand the distinction consider business inventories  If businesses end up with  more inventory than they planned then the difference represents unplanned  or unintended   business investment and actual output in the economy exceeded planned expenditure by that  amount  Second the available real money supply is willingly held by households and  businesses 
7,171,The first condition equality of planned expenditures and actual income output gives rise to  what is called the IS curve  The second condition equilibrium in the money market is  embodied in what is called the LM curve  When we put them together we get the aggregate  demand curve 
8,171,       Balancing Aggregate Income and Expenditure  The IS Curve
9,171,Total expenditure on domestically produced output comes from four sources  household  consumption  C  investments  I  government spending  G  and net exports  X   M   This can  be expressed as

2,172,Personal disposable income is equal to GDP  Y  plus transfer payments  F  minus retained  earnings and depreciation    business saving SB  minus direct and indirect taxes  R    Households allocate disposable income between consumption of goods and services  C  and  household saving  SH   Therefore
3,172,Y   F   SB   R   C   SH
4,172,Rearranging this equation we get
5,172,Y   C   S   T
6,172,where T    R   F  denotes net taxes and S    SB   SH  denotes total private sector saving 
7,172,Because total expenditures must be identical to aggregate income  Y  we have the following  relationship 
8,172,C   S   T   C   I   G    X   M 
9,172,By rearranging this equation we get the following fundamental relationship among domestic  saving investment the fiscal balance and the trade balance 
10,172,Equation    
11,172,S   I    G   T     X   M 
12,172,This equation shows that domestic private saving is used or absorbed in one of three ways   investment spending  I  financing government deficits  G   T  and building up financial  claims against overseas economies  positive trade balance  X   M        If there is a trade  deficit   X   M       then domestic private saving is being supplemented by inflows of foreign  saving and overseas economies are building up financial claims against the domestic economy 
13,172,By rearranging the identity we can examine the implications of government deficits and  surpluses 
14,172,G   T    S   I     X   M 
15,172,A fiscal deficit   G   T       implies that the private sector must save more than it invests   S    I       or the country must run a trade deficit   X   M       with corresponding inflow of  foreign saving or both 
16,172,EXAMPLE  
17,172,Foreign Capital Inflows Help Finance  Government Deficits
18,172,The budgetary situation changed dramatically in Canada during       As noted in  Example   the Department of Finance Canada reported that in      the combined  federal provincial government had a deficit of        million C    Thus the  government sector operated at a deficit that needed to be financed  How was this deficit  financed

2,173,Solution 
3,173,Using the formula G   T    S   I     X   M  shows that a budget deficit is financed  through either higher domestic saving  S  lower business investment  I  or borrowing  from foreigners  X   M   Private saving is given by
4,173,Private saving   Household saving   Undistributed corporate profits    Capital consumption allowance
5,173,Household saving for      is given in the solution to part   of Example    Using that  figure and the      values for undistributed corporate profits and capital consumption  allowance from Exhibit   we get
6,173,Private saving                            C       
7,173,Comparing this number to the level of private investment in      shows that private  sector saving exceeded investment spending by C                                    Thus domestic private saving financed over      percent of the deficit                
8,173,To finance the rest of the government deficit foreign imports  M  would have to exceed  exports  X  by C        From Exhibit   the actual trade deficit  amount of foreign  borrowing  was C       slightly greater than the amount required  This difference is  largely due to the statistical discrepancy caused by different data sources being used for  expenditure based and income based estimates of GDP 
9,173,Equation   is the key relationship that must hold in order for aggregate income and aggregate  expenditure to be equal  Up to this point we have treated it as simply an accounting identity   We now need to think of it as the outcome of explicit decisions on the part of households  businesses government and foreigners  When we do so we are faced with the question of what  underlies these decisions and how the requisite balance is established 
10,173,Economists have found that the dominant determinant of consumption spending is disposable  income  Y   SB   T   This can be expressed formally by indicating that consumption is a  function C    of disposable income
11,173,C   C Y   SB   T 
12,173,or dropping the technically correct but practically insignificant adjustment for retained earnings  and depreciation  SB  a function of GDP minus net taxes
13,173,C   C Y   T 
14,173,When households receive an additional unit of income some proportion of this additional  income is spent and the remainder is saved  The marginal propensity to consume  MPC   represents the proportion of an additional unit of disposable income that is consumed or spent   Because the amount that is not spent is saved the marginal propensity to save  MPS  is  MPS       MPC

2,174,According to the consumption function either an increase in real income or a decrease in taxes  will increase aggregate consumption  Somewhat more sophisticated models of consumption  recognize that consumption depends not only on current disposable income but also on wealth   Except for the very rich individuals tend to spend a higher fraction of their current income as  their wealth increases because with higher current wealth there is less need to save to provide  for future consumption 
3,174,Exhibit    shows household consumption expenditures as a percentage of GDP for selected  countries

6,174,These figures reflect the average propensity to consume  APC  that is the ratio C Y rather  than a measure of how the next unit of income would be divided between spending and saving  the MPC  However they are reasonable proxies for the MPC in each country  Comparing  Germany s      percent APC with Mexico s      percent the implication is that the Mexican  economy is more sensitive to changes in disposable household income than the German  economy  All other things being equal macroeconomic policies that increase disposable  household income such as lowering government taxes would have a larger impact on the  economies of Mexico       percent  and the United States       percent  than similar policies  would have in Germany       percent  or France       percent  
7,174,Companies are the primary source of investment spending  I   They make investment decisions  in order to expand their stock of physical capital such as building new factories or adding new  equipment to existing facilities  A definition of physical capital is any manmade aid to  production  Companies also buy investment goods such as manufacturing plants and  equipment to replace existing facilities and equipment that wear out  Total investment  including replacement of worn out capital is called gross investment as opposed to net  investment which reflects only the addition of new capacity  GDP includes gross investment   hence the name gross domestic product  Total investment spending in such developed countries  as Italy Germany the United Kingdom and the United States ranged between    and     percent of GDP in

2,175,Investment decisions depend primarily on two factors  the level of interest rates and aggregate  output income  The level of interest rates reflects the cost of financing investment  The level of  aggregate output serves as a proxy for the expected profitability of new investments  When an  economy is underutilizing its resources interest rates are typically very low and yet investment  spending often remains dormant because the expected return on new investments is also low   Conversely when output is high and companies have little spare capacity the expected return  on new investments is high  Thus investment decisions may be modeled as a decreasing  function I     of the real interest rate  nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of  inflation  and an increasing function of the level of aggregate output  Formally
3,175,I   I r Y 
4,175,where I is investment spending r is the real interest rate and Y is as usual aggregate income   This investment function leaves out some important drivers of investment decisions such as the  availability of new and better technology  Nonetheless it reflects the two most important  considerations  the cost of funding  represented by the real interest rate  and the expected  profitability of the new capital  proxied by the level of aggregate output  
5,175,Many government spending decisions are insensitive to the current level of economic activity  the level of interest rates the currency exchange rate and other economic factors  Thus  economists often treat the level of government spending on goods and services  G  as an  exogenous policy variable determined outside the macroeconomic model  In essence this  means that the adjustments required to maintain the balance among aggregate spending  income and output must occur primarily within the private sector 
6,175,Tax policy may also be viewed as an exogenous policy tool  However the actual amount of net  taxes  T  collected is closely tied to the level of economic activity  Most countries impose  income taxes or value added taxes  VAT  or both that increase with the level of income or  expenditure  Similarly at least some transfer payments to the household sector are usually  based on economic need and are hence inversely related to aggregate income  Each of these  factors makes net taxes  T  rise and fall with aggregate income Y  The government s fiscal  balance can be represented as
7,175,G   T      G   t  Y  
8,175,where    G is the exogenous level of government expenditure and t Y  indicates that net taxes are  an  increasing  function of aggregate income Y  The fiscal balance decreases  smaller deficit or  larger surplus  as aggregate income  Y  increases and increases as income declines  This effect  is called an automatic stabilizer because it tends to mitigate changes in aggregate output 
9,175,Net exports  X   M  are primarily a function of income in the domestic country and in the rest  of the world and the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods and services  As domestic  income rises some of the additional demand that is induced will be for imported goods  Thus  net exports will decline  An increase in income in the rest of the world will lead to an increase  in demand for the domestic country s products and hence an increase net exports  A decrease in  the relative price of domestically produced goods and services perhaps because of a  depreciation of the currency will shift demand toward these products and hence increase net  exports 
10,175,We are now in a position to describe how aggregate expenditure and income are brought into  balance  Slightly rearranging Equation   equality of expenditure and income implies

2,176,Based on the discussion above we know that both the government s fiscal balance and the trade  balance decrease as income rises because of net taxes and imports respectively  Hence the  right hand side of this equation declines with income  This is shown by the downward sloping  line in Exhibit     Assuming the direct effect of higher income on saving is larger than the  impact on investment the left hand side of the equation increases as income rises  This is  shown by the solid upward sloping line in Exhibit     Note that this line is drawn for a given  level of the real interest rate r   The intersection of these curves shows the level of income at  which expenditure and income balance  At higher levels of income the saving investment  differential  S   I  exceeds the combined fiscal and trade balances implying  excess saving  or  insufficient expenditure  At lower levels of income the saving investment differential is  smaller than the combined fiscal and trade balances implying planned expenditure exceeds  output    income

2,177,The dashed upward sloping line in the exhibit reflects a lower real interest rate r    r   This  line lies to the right of the solid line because for any value of the saving investment differential   S   I  the higher level of investment induced by a lower real interest rate requires a higher  level of income to induce higher saving  With a lower real interest rate the curves intersect at a  higher level of income  Thus we see that equilibrating income and expenditure entails an  inverse relationship between income and the real interest rate  Economists refer to this  relationship as the IS curve because investment  I  and saving  S  are the primary components  that adjust to maintain the balance between aggregate expenditure and income  The IS curve is  illustrated in Exhibit    in the next section 
3,177,EXAMPLE  
4,177,The IS Curve

7,177,   Based on these equations determine the combinations of aggregate income  Y   and the real interest rate  r  that are consistent with equating income and  expenditure  That is find the equation that describes the IS curve 
8,177,   Given a real interest rate of   percent find the level of GDP consumption  spending investment spending net exports and tax receipts 
9,177,   Suppose the government increased expenditure from      to       Find the new  IS curve  Does the increase in government spending result in an equal increase in  equilibrium income for any given level of the real interest rate  Why or why not 
10,177,   Given a real interest rate of   percent determine how the increased government  spending is funded 
11,177,   Suppose that the output income level calculated in Question   is the most that can  be produced with the economy s resources  If the economy is operating at that  level when the government increases expenditure from      to      what must  happen to maintain the balance between expenditure and income 
12,177,Solution to   
13,177,Starting with the basic GDP identity Y   C   I   G    X   M  and substituting for each  expenditure component using the equations above gives

13,178,Following the steps above but with G        the IS curve is
14,178,Y                 r
15,178,At any given level of the interest rate aggregate income increases by                                This is                     times the increase in government  spending  The increase in government spending has a  multiplier  effect on equilibrium  income because as income rises both consumption and investment spending also rise  leading to an even greater increase in income which leads to even more spending etc   However some of the increased private spending goes for imports and higher income  also induces higher taxes and saving  The condition for equality of income and  expenditure can be written as
16,178,G    S   I    T    M   X 
17,178,So the increase in government spending must be balanced by some combination of    an  increase in saving relative to investment    an increase in taxes and    a rise in imports  relative to exports  Given the interest rate each of these will be induced by an increase  in aggregate income  Because saving  S  equals Y   C   T

20,178,Using this result along with the investment tax and trade balance functions gives
21,178, G                 Y       Y       Y        Y So  Y             G        G

2,179,Note that an extra unit of income increases saving by      but also increases investment  spending by       So in this hypothetical economy the saving investment differential   S   I  is very insensitive to the level of aggregate income  All else the same this  implies that relatively large changes in income are required to restore the  expenditure income balance whenever there is a change in spending behavior 
3,179,Solution to   
4,179,Using the results above
5,179,Change in fiscal balance    G    T    G                                      Change in trade balance      X   M          G                              Change in  S   I        S   I          G                                
6,179,So the increase in government spending       is ultimately financed by a large increase  in taxes                   a very small increase in private sector excess saving       and an increase in capital flows from abroad       
7,179,Solution to   
8,179,If the economy is operating at maximum output then an increase in government  expenditure must  crowd out  an equal amount of private expenditure in order to keep  total expenditure equal to output income  In this simple model this implies that the real  interest rate must rise enough that investment spending falls by the amount of the  increase in government spending  Using the new IS curve equation from Question   and  the original level of income from Question   we need the interest rate such that
9,179,Y                 r              r         
10,179,So the real interest rate would soar from   percent to       percent to choke off  investment spending 
11,179,       Equilibrium in the Money Market  The LM Curve
12,179,The IS curve tells us what level of income is consistent with a given level of the real interest  rate but does not address the appropriate level of interest rates nor does it depend on the price  level  In order to determine the interest rate and introduce a connection between output and the  price level we must consider supply and demand in the financial markets  To keep the model as  simple as possible we will deal explicitly with demand and supply for only one financial asset   money  All other assets  e g  stocks and bonds  are implicitly treated as a composite alternative  to holding money  In some of the subsequent discussion however we will note differential  impacts on equity and fixed income securities 
13,179,The quantity theory of money equation provides a straightforward connection among the  nominal money supply  M  the price level  P  and real income expenditure  Y

2,180,MV   PY
3,180,In this equation V is the velocity of money the average rate at which money circulates through  the economy to facilitate expenditure  This equation essentially defines V  The equation begins  to have economic content only when we make assumptions about how velocity is related to  such economic variables as the interest rate  In the simplest case if velocity is assumed to be  constant then the quantity theory of money equation implies that the money supply determines  the nominal value of output  PY   Therefore an increase in the money supply will increase the  nominal value of output  However this equation alone cannot tell us how that increase would  be split between price and quantity 
4,180,The quantity theory equation can be rewritten in terms of the supply and demand for real money  balances 
5,180,M P    M P D   kY
6,180,where k     V reflects how much money people want to hold for every currency unit of real  income  The demand for real money balances is typically assumed to depend inversely on the  interest rate because a higher interest rate encourages investors to shift their assets out of money   bank deposits  into higher yielding securities  Although the quantity theory of money suggests  that the demand for real money balances is proportional to real income this need not be the  case  The important point is that money demand increases with income  Thus demand for real  money balances is an increasing function M     of real income and a decreasing function of the  interest rate  Equilibrium in the money market requires
7,180,M P   M rY 
8,180,Holding the real money supply  M P  constant this equation implies a positive relationship  between real income  Y  and the real interest rate  r   Given the real money supply an increase  in real income must be accompanied by an increase in the interest rate in order to keep the  demand for real money balances equal to the supply  This relationship which economists refer  to as the LM curve is shown by the upward sloping curve in Exhibit

2,181,The intersection of the IS and LM curves determines the combination of real income and the  real interest rate that is consistent with both the equality of income and  planned  expenditure   the IS curve  and equilibrium in the money market  the LM curve   In Exhibit    the dashed  LM curve reflects a higher real money supply than the solid LM curve  With a higher real  money supply the intersection of the IS and LM curves occurs at a higher level of real income  and a lower level of the real interest rate 
3,181,       The Aggregate Demand Curve
4,181,If the nominal money supply  M  is held constant then a higher or lower real money supply   M P  arises because of changes in the price level  If the price level declines the real money  supply increases and as shown in Exhibit    real income increases while the real interest rate  declines  Conversely an increase in the price level leads to a decline in real income and an  increase in the real interest rate  This inverse relationship between the price level and real  income is illustrated in Exhibit     This is the aggregate demand curve  AD curve

2,182,As shown in Exhibit    an increase in the price level from P  to P  reduces income from Y  to  Y   Our development of the AD curve emphasized only one channel through which prices affect  the quantity of output demanded  i e  planned real expenditure  the interest rate  There are  however other mechanisms  Higher prices erode the purchasing power of retirees and others  whose income is fixed in nominal terms  Similarly higher prices reduce the real value of  nominal assets  e g  stocks and bonds  and may reduce consumption relative to current income  as people seek to rebuild the real purchasing power of their wealth  Higher domestic prices also  make domestically produced goods more expensive relative to imports  assuming a constant  currency exchange rate   In each case lower prices have the opposite effect increasing  aggregate expenditure and income 
3,182,It should be clear that many interesting and important aspects of the economy are subsumed  into the AD curve  saving investment trade and capital flows interest rates asset prices fiscal  and monetary policy and more  All of these disappear behind a deceptively simple relationship  between price and output income 
4,182,Before moving on to consider aggregate supply let s look more closely at the interaction of  interest rates and income implicit in movements along the AD curve  For simplicity we assume  there are no changes in the fiscal or trade balances so that maintaining the balance between  aggregate expenditure and aggregate income requires that changes in investment spending equal  changes in private saving  As the price level increases the real money supply  M P  declines   To induce a corresponding decline in money demand the interest rate must rise so that other  assets are more attractive and income must fall to reduce the transactional need for money  balances  The higher interest rate induces companies to reduce investment spending  The  decline in income reduces household saving  The slope of the AD curve depends on the relative  sensitivities of investment saving and money demand to income and the interest rate  The AD  curve will be flatter if
5,182,  investment expenditure is highly sensitive to the interest rate

2,183,  saving is insensitive to income 
3,183,  money demand is insensitive to interest rates  and
4,183,  money demand is insensitive to income 
5,183,The first two conditions directly imply that income will have to move more to induce a large  enough change in saving to match the change in investment spending  All else equal each of  the last two conditions implies that a larger change in the interest rate is required to bring  money demand in line with money supply  This in turn implies a larger change in investment  spending and a correspondingly larger change in saving and income

2,185,Comparing the new AD curve to the original AD curve indicates that output  Y  is now  more sensitive to the price level  That is the AD curve is flatter  Monetary policy is now  more effective because at any given price level an increase in M has a greater impact  on Y  This can be understood as follows  As the real money supply increases the interest  rate must fall and or expenditure must increase in order to induce households to hold the  increased money supply  With investment spending now more sensitive to the interest  rate income will have to rise by more in order to increase saving by a corresponding  amount 
3,185,     Aggregate Supply
4,185,Aggregate demand only tells us the relationship between the price level and the amount of  output demanded at those prices  To understand what price and output level will prevail in the  economy we need to add aggregate supply the amount of output producers are willing to  provide at various prices  The aggregate supply curve  AS curve  represents the level of  domestic output that companies will produce at each price level  Unlike the demand side we  must distinguish between the short  and long run AS curves which differ with respect to how  wages and other input prices respond to changes in final output prices   Long run  and  short  run  are relative terms and are necessarily imprecise with respect to calendar time  The  long  run  is long enough that wages prices and expectations can adjust but not long enough that  physical capital is a variable input  Capital and the available technology to use that capital  remain fixed  This condition implies a period of at least a few years and perhaps a decade  The  truly long run in which even the capital stock is variable may be thought of as covering multiple  decades  Consideration of the very long run is postponed to our discussion of economic growth  in Section   
5,185,In the very short run perhaps a few months or quarters companies will increase or decrease  output to some degree without changing price  This is shown in Exhibit    by the horizontal  line labeled VSRAS  If demand is somewhat stronger than expected companies earn higher  profit by increasing output as long as they can cover their variable costs  So they will run their  plant and equipment more intensively demand more effort from their salaried employees and  increase the hours of employees who are paid on the basis of hours worked  If demand is  somewhat weaker than projected companies can run their plants less intensively cut labor  hours and utilize staff to perform maintenance and carry out efficiency enhancing projects that  are often postponed during busier periods

2,186,Exhibit     Aggregate Supply Curve
3,186,Over somewhat longer periods the AS curve is upward sloping because more costs become  variable  This is represented by the short run aggregate supply  SRAS  curve in Exhibit     In  most businesses wages are adjusted once a year but for companies with union contracts  several years may pass before the contracts expire  The prices for raw materials and other inputs  may also be established under long term contracts  Hence wages and other input costs are  relatively inflexible in the short run and do not fully adjust to changes in output prices  As the  price level rises most companies enjoy higher profit margins and hence expand production  In  Exhibit    when prices move from P  to P  the quantity of aggregate output supplied increases  from Y  to Y   Conversely a reduction in the price level squeezes profit margins and causes  companies to reduce production 
4,186,Over time however wages and other input prices tend to  catch up  with the prices of final  goods and services  In other words wages and prices that are inflexible or slow to adjust in the  short run adjust to changes in the price level over the long run  Thus over the long run when  the aggregate price level changes wages and other input prices change proportionately so that  the higher aggregate price level has no impact on aggregate supply  This is illustrated by the  vertical long run aggregate supply  LRAS  curve in Exhibit     As prices move from P  to P   the quantity of output supplied remains at Q  in the long run  The only change that occurs is that  prices shift to a higher level  from P  to P   
5,186,The position of the LRAS curve is determined by the potential output of the economy  The  amount of output produced depends on the fixed amount of capital and labor and the available  technology  This classical model of aggregate supply can be expressed as

3,187,where     K is the fixed amount of capital and    L is the available labor supply  The stock of capital  is assumed to incorporate the existing technological base    The available labor supply is also  held constant and workers are assumed to have a given set of skills  The long run equilibrium  level of output Y  in Exhibit    is referred to as the full employment or natural level of  output  At this level of output the economy s resources are deemed to be fully employed and   labor  unemployment is at its natural rate  This concept of a natural rate of unemployment  assumes the macroeconomy is currently operating at an efficient and unconstrained level of  production  Companies have enough spare capacity to avoid bottlenecks and there is a modest  stable pool of unemployed workers  job seekers equal job vacancies  looking for and  transitioning into new jobs 
4,187,     Shifts in Aggregate Demand and Supply
5,187,In the next two sections the aggregate demand  AD  and aggregate supply  AS  models are  used to address three critical macroeconomic questions 
6,187,   What causes an economy to expand or contract 
7,187,   What causes inflation and changes in the level of unemployment 
8,187,   What determines an economy s rate of sustainable growth and how can it be measured 
9,187,Before addressing these questions we need to distinguish between    the long run growth rate  of real GDP and    short run fluctuations in real GDP around this long run trend 
10,187,The business cycle is a direct result of short term fluctuations of real GDP  It consists of periods  of economic expansion and contraction  In an expansion real GDP is increasing the  unemployment rate is declining and capacity utilization is rising  In a contraction real GDP is  decreasing the unemployment rate is rising and capacity utilization is declining  Shifts in the  AD and AS curves determine the short run changes in the economy associated with the business  cycle  In addition the AD AS model provides a framework for estimating the sustainable  growth rate of an economy which is addressed in Section   
11,187,From an asset allocation perspective it is important to determine the current phase of the  business cycle as well as how fast the economy is growing relative to its sustainable growth  rate  The expected rate of return on equities and fixed income securities for example depends  on estimates of the growth rate of GDP and inflation  For equities GDP growth is the primary  determinant of aggregate corporate profits  For fixed income securities the expected rate of  inflation determines the spread between real and nominal rates of return  In order to use the AD  and AS model to analyze the economy and to make investment decisions we need to first  understand what factors cause the curves to shift

2,189,Household Wealth
3,189,Household wealth includes the value of both financial assets  e g  cash savings accounts  investment securities and pensions  and real assets  e g  real estate   The primary reason  households save a portion of their current income is to accumulate wealth for consumption in  the future  The proportion of disposable income that households save depends partly on the  value of the financial and real assets that they have already accumulated  If these assets increase  in value households will tend to save less and spend a greater proportion of their income  because they will still be able to meet their wealth accumulation goals  As a result an increase  in household wealth increases consumer spending and shifts the aggregate demand curve to the  right  In contrast a decline in wealth will reduce consumer spending and shift the AD curve to  the left  This is often referred to as the wealth effect and is one explanation for how changes in  equity prices affect economic activity  Higher equity prices increase household wealth which  increases consumer spending and reduces the amount saved out of current income  Economic  studies estimate that an increase or decrease in wealth in developed countries increases or  decreases annual consumer spending by     percent of the change in wealth    A smaller but  still statistically significant wealth effect has been found in a number of emerging markets   developing countries

2,190,The Wealth Effect on Saving and  Consumption
3,190,The importance of the wealth effect on consumption and its relationship to housing  prices was evident in the recession that began in late       During this period global  GDP declined by the steepest amount in the post World War II period  A major factor  associated with the economic downturn was the sharp fall in housing prices especially  in countries that experienced a housing boom earlier in the decade such as the United  States the United Kingdom Spain and Ireland  In each of these countries consumers  reduced spending sharply and raised the level of saving in response to the decline in  wealth  Do the data in Exhibit    provide support for the wealth effect 
4,190,Solution 
5,190,Housing prices in the United Kingdom rose by nearly     percent                      between      and       As predicted the saving rate declined  with a lag  going from  an average of     percent of income in      and      to     percent in       Then as  housing prices fell by      percent between      and      the saving rate rose  dramatically from     percent in      to   percent in       Of course the decline in  housing prices was not the only factor contributing to the increase in the saving rate   Stock prices also declined in this period further reducing wealth in the United  Kingdom and the recession raised uncertainty over future jobs and income 
6,190,Consumer and Business Expectations
7,190,Psychology has an important impact on consumer and business spending  When consumers are  confident about their future income and the stability safety of their jobs they tend to spend a  higher portion of their disposable income  This shifts the AD curve to the right  Consumer  spending declines and the AD curve shifts to the left when consumers become less confident   Similarly when businesses are optimistic about their future growth and profitability they spend   invest  more on capital projects which also shifts the AD curve to the right 
8,190,Capacity Utilization
9,190,Capacity utilization is a measure of how fully an economy s production capacity is being used   Companies with excess capacity have little incentive to invest in new property plant and  equipment  In contrast when companies are operating at or near full capacity they will need to  increase investment spending in order to expand production  Data from the OECD and the US  Federal Reserve indicate that when aggregate capacity utilization reaches    to    percent  production blockages arise prompting companies to increase their level of investment  spending  This shifts the AD curve to the right

2,191,Fiscal Policy
3,191,Fiscal policy is the use of taxes and government spending to affect the level of aggregate  expenditures    An increase in government spending one of the direct components of AD  shifts the AD curve to the right whereas a decrease in government spending shifts the AD  curve to the left  Taxes affect GDP indirectly through their effect on consumer spending and  business investment  Lower taxes will increase the proportion of personal income and corporate  pre tax profits that consumers and businesses have available to spend and will shift the AD  curve to the right  In contrast higher taxes will shift the AD curve to the left 
4,191,Monetary Policy
5,191,Money is generally defined as currency in circulation plus deposits at commercial banks   Monetary policy refers to action taken by a nation s central bank to affect aggregate output  and prices through changes in bank reserves reserve requirements or its target interest rate 
6,191,Most countries have fractional reserve banking systems in which each bank must hold reserves   vault cash plus deposits at the central bank  at least equal to the required reserve ratio times its  customer deposits  Banks with excess reserves can lend them to banks that need reserves to  meet their reserve requirements  The central bank can increase the money supply by    buying  securities from banks    lowering the required reserve ratio and or    reducing its target for the  interest rate at which banks borrow and lend reserves among themselves  In each case the  opposite action would decrease the money supply 
7,191,When the central bank buys securities from banks in an open market operation it pays for them  with a corresponding increase in bank reserves  This increases the amount of deposits banks can  accept from their customers that is the money supply  Similarly cutting the required reserve  ratio increases the level of deposits  i e  money  consistent with a given level of reserves in the  system  If the central bank chooses to target an interbank lending rate as the Federal Reserve  targets the federal funds rate in the United States then it must add or drain reserves via open  market operations to maintain the target interest rate  If it raises  lowers  its target interest rate  it will have to drain  add  reserves in order to make reserves more  less  expensive in the  interbank market  Thus open market operations and interest rate targeting are very closely  related  The main distinction is whether the central bank chooses to target a level of reserves  and let the market determine the interest rate or chooses to target the interest rate and let the  market  banks  determine the level of reserves they desire to hold at that rate 
8,191,An increase in the money supply shifts the AD curve to the right so that each price level  corresponds to a higher level of income and expenditure    There are various channels through  which the additional expenditures may be induced  For example the interest rate reduction  required to induce investors to hold the additional money balances will encourage companies to  investment more and households to borrow to purchase durable goods such as cars  In addition  banks may facilitate greater expenditure by raising credit limits and loosening credit standards   Conversely a reduction in the money supply shifts the AD curve to the left

2,192,Exhibit    illustrates the short run and long run effect of expansionary monetary policy   Suppose the central bank expands the money supply in an attempt to stimulate demand when  the economy is already in long run equilibrium  The expansionary policy will shift the AD  curve to the right from AD  to AD   In the very short run output will expand from Y  to Y  without an increase in the price level  After operating at higher than normal production rates for  a few months or quarters companies will begin to push for price increases and input prices will  begin to rise as well  The aggregate supply curve will steepen and prices will increase to P  while output declines to Y   As input prices become more flexible the AS curve will steepen  until in the long run it is vertical and output has returned to the long run natural level Y  with  prices rising to P   Thus expanding the money supply increases output in the short run but in  the long run it affects only the price level

4,192,Exchange Rate
5,192,An exchange rate is the price of one currency relative to another  Changes in the exchange rate  affect the price of exports and imports and thus aggregate demand  For example a lower euro  relative to other currencies makes European exports cheaper in world markets and foreign  products sold in Europe  European imports  more expensive  Therefore a lower euro should  cause European exports to increase and imports to decline causing the AD curve to shift to the  right  Conversely a stronger euro reduces exports and raises imports and the AD curve shifts to  the left

2,193,Growth in the Global Economy
3,193,International trade is what links countries together and creates a global economy  Faster  economic growth in foreign markets encourages foreigners to buy more products from domestic  producers and increases exports  For example rapid GDP growth in ASEAN member countries  has increased their demand for foreign products  Japan has benefited from this rapid growth  because it has exported more products to them  In terms of the AD and AS model the AD curve  for Japan has shifted to the right because of increased demand for Japanese products in ASEAN  countries resulting in higher exports  A decline in the growth rates of ASEAN members   economies would have a negative effect on the Japanese economy because exports would be  lower  This would cause the Japanese AD curve to shift to the left 
4,193,What happens to interest rates when the AD curve shifts  In the case of an increase in the  money supply the interest rate declines at each price level because the increase in income  Y   increases saving and rates must decline to induce a corresponding increase in investment  spending  I   In each of the other cases considered above a rightward shift in the AD curve will  increase the interest rate at each price level  With the real money supply held constant the  interest rate must rise as income increases  The increase in the interest rate reduces the demand  for money at each level of expenditure income and therefore allows expenditure income to  increase without an increase in the money supply  In terms of the quantity theory of money  equation this corresponds to a higher velocity of money V 
5,193,The main factors that shift the AD curve are summarized in Exhibit     In each case the impact  of the factor is considered in isolation  In practice however various factors may be at work  simultaneously and there may be interaction among them  This is especially true with regard to  expectational factors consumer and business confidence which are likely to be influenced by  other developments

10,194,Shifts in Aggregate Demand
11,194,Francois Ubert is a portfolio manager with EuroWorld a French investment  management firm  Ubert is considering increasing his clients  portfolio exposure to  Brazilian equities  Before doing so he asks you to prepare a report on the following  recent economic events in Brazil and to summarize the impact of each event on the  Brazilian economy and on Brazilian equity and fixed income securities 
12,194,   The Brazilian central bank reduced bank reserves resulting in a lower money  supply 
13,194,   The capacity utilization rate in Brazil is currently estimated to be      percent a      percent increase from the previous year 
14,194,   Corporate profits reported by Brazilian companies increased by    percent over  last year s levels and corporations have revised their forecasts of future  profitability upward 
15,194,   The government recently announced that it plans to start construction on a number  of hydroelectric projects to reduce Brazil s reliance on imported oil 
16,194,   Forecasts by private sector economists project that the European economy will  enter a recession in the next year 
17,194,Solution to   
18,194,This monetary policy action is designed to reduce consumption and business investment  spending  The reduction in real money balances will increase interest rates and  discourage lending within the banking system  Higher interest rates and tighter credit  will reduce both investment and consumption expenditures and shift the AD curve to the  left  The prices of fixed income securities will fall because of the rise in interest rates   The reduction in aggregate output should lower corporate profits and it is likely that  equity prices will also fall

2,195,Solution to   
3,195,Capacity utilization is a key factor determining the level of investment spending  A  current utilization rate of over    percent and an increase from the previous year  indicate a growing lack of spare capacity in the Brazilian economy  As a result  businesses will probably increase their level of capital spending  This will increase AD  and shift the AD curve to the right  Higher economic activity  income output  will cause  upward pressure on interest rates and may have a negative impact on fixed income  securities  Higher income output should increase corporate profits and is likely to have a  positive impact on equity securities 
4,195,Solution to   
5,195,Expected corporate profits are an important determinant of the level of investment  spending  The large increase in expected profits will raise the level of investment  spending and increase aggregate demand  This will shift the AD curve to the right  The  increase in corporate profits and the resulting increase in economic output should have a  positive impact on equities  The increase in output will put upward pressure on interest  rates and downward pressure on the prices of fixed income securities 
6,195,Solution to   
7,195,Fiscal policy uses government spending to influence the level and growth rate of  economic activity  The announcement indicates an increase in government spending  which is a direct component of AD  Therefore higher spending on the projects will  increase AD and shift the AD curve to the right  The increase in output and expenditure  should be positive for equities  But it will be negative for existing fixed income  investments because higher interest rates will be required to induce investors to buy and  hold the government debt issued to fund the new projects 
8,195,Solution to   
9,195,A recession in Europe will decrease the demand for Brazilian exports by European  households and businesses and shift the AD curve to the left  The resulting decline in  income and downward pressure on prices will be positive for fixed income securities but  negative for equities 
10,195,       Shifts in Short Run Aggregate Supply
11,195,Factors that change the cost of production or expected profit margins will cause the SRAS  curve to shift  These factors include changes in
12,195,  nominal wages 
13,195,  input prices including the price of natural resources 
14,195,  expectations about future output prices and the overall price level 
15,195,  business taxes and subsidies  and

2,196,  the exchange rate 
3,196,In addition factors that shift the long run AS curve  see Section        will also shift the SRAS  curve by a corresponding amount because the SRAS and LRAS reflect the same underlying  resources and technology  As the economy s resources and technology change the full  employment  or natural  level of output changes and both the LRAS and SRAS shift  accordingly 
4,196,Change in Nominal Wages
5,196,Changes in nominal wages shift the short run AS curve because wages are often the largest  component of a company s costs  An increase in nominal wages raises production costs  resulting in a decrease in AS and a leftward shift in the SRAS curve  Lower wages shift the AS  curve to the right  It is important to note that changes in nominal wages have no impact on the  LRAS curve 
6,196,A better way to measure the impact of labor costs on the AS curve is to measure the change in  unit labor cost  We define the change in unit labor cost as
7,196,  Change in unit labor cost     Change in nominal wages     Change in productivity
8,196,EXAMPLE  
9,196,Unit Labor Cost and Short Run Aggregate  Supply
10,196,Suppose Finnish workers are paid     an hour and are able to produce     cell phones  in an hour  The labor cost per cell phone is            divided by     units   If the  wages per hour for Finnish workers rise by    percent from     to     and they are able  to raise their productivity by    percent what is the impact on unit labor cost and the  short run aggregate supply curve 
11,196,Solution 
12,196,The workers can now produce     cell phones per hour and unit labor cost will not  change                  In this case the SRAS curve will remain in its original position   If wages had increased by    percent instead of    percent then unit labor cost would  have increased and the SRAS would shift to the left  Conversely if the wage increase  were only   percent then unit labor cost would have decreased and the SRAS would  shift to the right

2,197,Change in Input Prices
3,197,The price of raw materials is an important component of cost for many businesses  Lower input  prices reduce the cost of production which in turn makes companies willing to produce more  at any output price  This is reflected in a rightward shift of the SRAS curve  Conversely higher  input prices increase production costs which in turn causes companies to reduce production at  any output price  This shifts the SRAS curve to the left  During the     s high oil prices  caused the SRAS curve in most countries to shift to the left  In contrast in the mid     s  declining oil prices lowered the cost of production and shifted the SRAS curve in most  countries to the right  Oil prices currently have a smaller impact on the global economy than in  the     s and     s because most countries have reduced their reliance on oil and improved  their energy efficiency so that they now use less energy per unit of GDP 
4,197,Change in Expectations about Future Prices
5,197,The impact of expected future prices on current output decisions is not as straightforward as it  might seem  First each company is primarily concerned about the price of its own output rather  than the general price level  The latter may be more reflective of its costs  If it expects its own  output price to rise  fall  relative to the general price level then it may increase  decrease   production in response to the perceived change in its profit margin  As more and more  companies become optimistic  pessimistic  about their ability to raise the relative price of their  product the SRAS will shift to the right  left   In the aggregate of course companies can  neither raise nor lower their prices relative to the general price level  Hence shifts in the SRAS  driven by such price expectations are likely to be modest and temporary  Second considering  future prices introduces a temporal aspect into decision making  If the future price level is  expected to be higher companies may decide to produce more today in order to expand  inventory available for future sale  But they will only do so if the cost of carrying inventory   financing storage and spoilage  is less than they expect to save on production costs by  producing more today and less in the future  Conversely they may cut current production and  sell out of existing inventory if they expect future prices  and costs  to be lower 
6,197,The upshot is that expectations of higher  lower  future prices are likely to shift the SRAS curve  to the right  left  but the impact may be modest and or temporary 
7,197,Change in Business Taxes and Subsidies
8,197,Higher business taxes increase production costs per unit and shift the short run AS curve to the  left  Business subsidies are a payment from the government to the producer  Subsidies for  businesses lower their production costs and shift the SRAS curve to the right 
9,197,Change in the Exchange Rate
10,197,Many countries import raw materials including energy and intermediate goods  As a result  changes in the exchange rate can affect the cost of production and therefore aggregate supply   A higher Yen relative to the Euro will lower the cost of raw materials and intermediate goods  imported to Japan from Europe  This in turn will lower the production costs of Japanese  producers and shift the AS curve in Japan to the right  A lower Yen will have the opposite  effect

2,198,As discussed above the position of the LRAS curve is determined by the potential output of the  economy  Potential GDP measures the productive capacity of the economy and is the level of  real GDP that can be produced at full employment  Potential GDP is not a static concept but can  increase each year at a steady rate as the economy s resource capacity grows  Therefore any  factor increasing the resource base of an economy causes the LRAS curve to shift as shown in
3,198,Exhibit    
4,198,Exhibit     Shift in Long Run Aggregate Supply  LRAS  Curve
5,198,These factors include changes in
6,198,  supply of labor and quality of labor forces  human capital  
7,198,  supply of natural resources 
8,198,  supply of physical capital  and
9,198,  productivity and technology 
10,198,Supply of Labor
11,198,The larger the supply of labor the more output the economy can produce  The labor supply  depends on growth in the population the labor force participation rate  the percentage of the  population working or looking for work  and net immigration  The determinants of the labor  supply are discussed in more detail in Section    Increases in the labor supply shift the LRAS  curve to the right  Decreases shift the curve to the left 
12,198,Supply of Natural Resources
13,198,Natural resources are essential inputs to the production process and include everything from  available land to oil to water  Increased availability of natural resources shifts the LRAS curve  to the right

2,199,Supply of Physical Capital
3,199,Investment in new property plant equipment and software is an essential ingredient for  growth  An increase in the stock of physical capital will increase the capacity of the economy to  produce goods and services  Simply put if workers are provided with more and better  equipment to use they should be able to produce more output than they could with the older  equipment  Thus strong growth in business investment which increases the supply of physical  capital shifts the LRAS curve to the right 
4,199,Supply of Human Capital
5,199,Another way to raise the productive capacity of a country is to increase human capital the  quality of the labor force through training skills development and education  Improvement in  the quality of the labor force shifts the LRAS curve to the right 
6,199,Labor Productivity and Technology
7,199,Another important factor affecting the productive capacity of an economy is how efficient labor  is in transforming inputs into final goods and services  Productivity measures the efficiency of  labor and is the amount of output produced by workers in a given period of time for example  output per hour worked  An increase in productivity decreases labor cost improves  profitability and results in higher output  Two of the main drivers of labor  productivity physical capital per worker and the quality of the workforce have been  discussed above  The third key determinant of productivity is technology  Advances in  technology shift the LRAS curve to the right 
8,199,EXAMPLE   
9,199,Unit Labor Cost and Long Run Aggregate  Supply
10,199,Finnish workers are paid     per hour and are able to produce     cell phones in an  hour  If workers develop a new technique for assembly and are able to produce     cell  phones per hour what is the impact on the long run aggregate supply curve 
11,199,Solution 
12,199,Labor cost per unit will decline to                       per cell phone   As a result  profit per unit will rise and companies will have an incentive to increase production   Thus the LRAS curve shifts to the right 
13,199,The factors shifting the AS curve are summarized in Exhibit     Rightward shifts in the SRAS  or LRAS curves are defined as an increase in supply  Leftward shifts in the SRAS or LRAS  curves represent a decrease in supply

21,200,Anticipation of higher costs and or  perception of improved pricing  power Increases cost of production Lowers cost of production Lowers cost of production
22,200,As with our summary of factors that shift the AD curve Exhibit    considers each of the factors  affecting aggregate supply in isolation  In practice various factors will be at work  simultaneously and there may be interaction among them  This is especially important with  respect to interaction between factors listed as affecting only SRAS and those that also impact  LRAS 
23,200,For example consider an increase in the cost of natural resource inputs  e g  energy   This  shifts the SRAS curve to the left but according to Exhibit    it has no effect on LRAS  This  presumes that there has not been a permanent change in the relative prices of the factors of  production  If there has been a permanent change companies will be forced to conserve on the  now more expensive input and will not be able to produce as efficiently  The LRAS curve  would therefore shift to the left just as it would if the available supply of natural resources had  declined relative to the supply of other inputs  Indeed that is the most likely cause of a  permanent change in relative input prices

2,201,Shifts in Aggregate Supply
3,201,John Donovan is a portfolio manager for a global mutual fund  Currently his fund has     percent of its assets invested in Chinese equities  He is considering increasing the  fund s allocation to the Chinese equity market  His decision will be based on an analysis  of the following economic developments and their impact on the Chinese economy and  equity market  What is the impact on SRAS and LRAS from the following factors 
4,201,   Global oil prices currently near their longer run trend at     a barrel have  increased from     a barrel over the last three years because of strong demand  from China and India 
5,201,   The number of students studying engineering has dramatically increased at  Chinese universities over the last decade 
6,201,   Wages for China s workers are rising leading some multinational companies to  consider shifting their investments to Vietnam or India 
7,201,   Recent data show that business investment as a share of GDP is over    percent in  China 
8,201,   The People s Bank of China is likely to permit the yuan to appreciate by     percent over the next year 
9,201,Solution to   
10,201,Higher energy prices cause a decrease in short run AS and shift the SRAS curve to the  left  Because oil prices are back to their longer run trend the leftward shift in SRAS  essentially reverses a previous shift that occurred when oil prices fell to     and it is  likely that there will be no impact on the LRAS curve  Lower output and profit are  likely to have a negative effect on Chinese equity prices 
11,201,Solution to   
12,201,More students studying engineering indicates an improvement in the quality of the labor  force an increase in human capital  As a result AS increases and the AS curve shifts to  the right  Both short run and long run curves are affected  Higher output and profits may  be expected to have a positive effect on Chinese equity prices 
13,201,Solution to   
14,201,The increase in wages increases labor costs for businesses causes short run aggregate  supply to decline and shifts the SRAS curve to the left  Lower output and profit should  have a negative effect on Chinese equity prices 
15,201,Solution to   
16,201,The high level of business investment indicates that the capital stock in China is  growing at a fast rate  This means that workers have more capital to use which  increases their productivity  Thus AS increases and the AS curve shifts to the right   Both short run AS and long run AS are affected  Higher output should have a positive  effect on Chinese equity prices

2,202,Solution to   
3,202,The probable appreciation of the yuan means that the cost of imported raw materials  such as iron ore coal and oil will be lower for Chinese companies  As a result short  run AS increases and the SRAS curve shifts to the right  The LRAS curve may also shift  to the right if the appreciation of the yuan is permanent and global commodity prices do  not fully adjust  Higher output and profit should have a positive effect on Chinese equity  prices   
4,202,The implications of the above factors for equity investment in China are ambiguous  If  the long run effects dominate however then the net impact should be positive  The  positive factors the high level of investment and the growing pool of engineering  students have a lasting impact on output and profit  The negative factors higher  wages and oil prices should be temporary because wages will realign with the price  level and the increase in oil prices appears to offset a previous temporary decline  The  reduction in raw material prices due to the stronger currency is positive for output  profit and equities in the short run and perhaps in the long run as well 
5,202,     Equilibrium GDP and Prices
6,202,Now that we have discussed the components of the AD and AS model we can combine them to  determine the real level of GDP and the price level  Equilibrium occurs where the AD and AS  curves intersect  At this point the quantity of aggregate output demanded  or the level of  aggregate expenditures  is equal to the quantity of aggregate output supplied  In Exhibit     equilibrium price and GDP occur at P  and Y   If the price level is above P  then the quantity of  output supplied exceeds the amount demanded  This situation would result in unsold inventories  and would require a reduction in production and in prices  If the price level is below P  then the  quantity of aggregate output demanded exceeds the quantity of aggregate output supplied  This  situation would result in a shortage of goods that would put upward pressure on prices 
7,202,It is important to understand that short run macroeconomic equilibrium may occur at a level  above or below full employment  We consider four possible types of macroeconomic  equilibrium 
8,202,   Long run full employment
9,202,   Short run recessionary gap
10,202,   Short run inflationary gap
11,202,   Short run stagflation
12,202,From an investment perspective the performance of asset classes and financial markets will  differ in each of the above cases as the economy makes the adjustment toward the  macroeconomic equilibrium  We look at these differences later in the reading

2,203,       Long Run Equilibrium
3,203,Exhibit    shows the long run full employment equilibrium for an economy  In this case  equilibrium occurs where the AD curve intersects the SRAS curve at a point on the LRAS  curve  Because equilibrium occurs at a point on the LRAS curve the economy is at potential  real GDP  Both labor and capital are fully employed and everyone who wants a job has one  In  the long run equilibrium GDP is equal to potential GDP 
4,203,Exhibit     Long Run Macroeconomic Equilibrium
5,203,In practice the level of potential GDP is difficult to measure with precision  Because of  fluctuations arising from shifts in the AD and SRAS curves the economy rarely operates at  potential GDP  Thus potential GDP is not observable from the data on actual GDP  In addition  potential GDP is determined by factors that are themselves difficult to measure  see Section        Thus  bottom up  estimates of the level of potential output are also quite imprecise   However as will be discussed in Section   economists have confidence that the long run  growth rate of potential GDP can be estimated well enough to provide meaningful guidance for  analysts and policymakers  Hence in the short run economists generally focus on factors that  cause actual GDP to grow faster or slower than their estimate of the long run growth rate of  potential output  In addition they focus on measures that indicate albeit imprecisely the extent  to which the economy is operating above or below its productive capacity such as  unemployment and capacity utilization

3,204,Cyclical fluctuations in real GDP and prices are caused by shifts in both the AD and SRAS  curves  A decline in AD or a leftward shift in the AD curve results in lower GDP and lower  prices  Such declines in AD lead to economic contractions and if such declines drive demand  below the economy s potential GDP the economy goes into a recession  In Exhibit    when  aggregate demand falls the equilibrium shifts from Point A to Point B  Real GDP contracts  from Y  to Y  and the aggregate price level falls from P  to P   Because of the decline in  demand companies reduce their workforce and the unemployment rate rises  The economy is in  recession   and the recessionary gap is measured as the difference between Y  and Y  or the  amount by which equilibrium output is below potential GDP  Thus a recessionary gap occurs  when the AD curve intersects the short run AS curve at a short run equilibrium level of GDP  below potential GDP  Most importantly in contrast to full employment equilibrium GDP is  below potential GDP 
4,204,Exhibit     Recessionary Gap
5,204,Any of the factors discussed in Section       could cause the shift in the AD curve  Tightening  of monetary policy higher taxes more pessimistic consumers and businesses and lower equity  and housing prices all reduce AD and are all possible causes of a recession 
6,204,The question is How does the economy return to full employment  There is considerable  debate among economists about the answer to this question  Some economists argue that an  automatic self correcting mechanism will push the economy back to its potential without the  need for government action  The idea is that because of the decline in prices and higher  unemployment workers will be willing to accept lower nominal wages  Workers will do this  because each currency unit of wages now buys more goods and services because of their lower  price  As a result lower wages and input prices will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the right   see Exhibit     and push the economy back to full employment and potential GDP

2,205,The problem is that this price mechanism can take several years to work  As an alternative  government can use the tools of fiscal and monetary policy to shift the AD curve to the right   from Point B to Point A in Exhibit     and move the economy back to full employment  On the  fiscal side policymakers can reduce taxes or increase government spending  On the monetary  side the central bank can lower interest rates or increase the money supply  The problem  however is that variable lags in the effectiveness of these policy measures imply that policy  adjustments may end up reinforcing rather than counteracting underlying shifts in the economy 
3,205,Investment Implications of a Decrease in AD
4,205,Aggregate demand and aggregate supply are theoretical measures that are very hard to measure  directly  Most governments however publish statistics that provide an indication of the  direction that aggregate demand and supply are moving over time  For example statistics on  consumer sentiment factory orders for durable and nondurable goods the value of unfilled  orders the number of new housing starts the number of hours worked and changes in  inventories provide an indication of the direction of aggregate demand  If these statistics  suggest that a recession is caused by a decline in AD the following conditions are likely to  occur 
5,205,  Corporate profits will decline 
6,205,  Commodity prices will decline 
7,205,  Interest rates will decline 
8,205,  Demand for credit will decline 
9,205,This suggests the following investment strategy 
10,205,  Reduce investments in cyclical companies   because their earnings are likely to  decline the most in an economic slowdown 
11,205,  Reduce investments in commodities and or commodity oriented companies because the  decline in commodity prices will slow revenue growth and reduce profit margins 
12,205,  Increase investments in defensive companies   because they are likely to experience  only modest earnings declines in an economic slowdown 
13,205,  Increase investments in investment grade or government issued fixed income securities   The prices of these securities should increase as interest rates decline 
14,205,  Increase investments in long maturity fixed income securities because their prices will be  more responsive to the decline in interest rates than the prices of shorter maturity  securities 
15,205,  Reduce investments in speculative equity securities and in fixed income securities with  low credit quality ratings 
16,205,As with most investment strategies this strategy will be most successful if it is implemented  before other market participants recognize the opportunities and asset prices adjust

2,206,Using AD and AS  The Recession of           
3,206,Many Asian economies were more adversely affected than the United States by the  global recession that began in late       In the first quarter of      real GDP fell at an  annualized rate of    percent in Japan and    percent in Singapore compared with a    percent annualized decline in the United States  Using the data on exports as a share of  GDP shown in Exhibit    explain how the following economic factors contributed to  the recession in the Asian economies 
4,206,   Collapse of house prices and home construction in the United States 
5,206,   Oil prices rising from around     a barrel in      to nearly      a barrel in         Note  Most Asian economies rely on imports for almost all of their oil and energy  needs  In contrast the United States has a large domestic energy industry and  imports about one half of its oil

2,207,Solution to   
3,207,The collapse in housing prices caused housing construction spending a component of  business investment to decline in the United States  The decline in housing prices also  caused a sharp fall in household wealth  As a result consumption spending in the United  States declined because of the wealth effect  The decline in both consumption and  housing construction shifted the AD curve for the United States to the left resulting in a  US recession  The link to the Asian economies was through global trade because exports  represented such a large share of the Asian economies  GDP  Exhibit      In turn these  economies exported a significant amount of goods and services to the United States   Thus the recession in the United States and especially the decline in US consumption  spending caused a sharp fall in exports among Asian economies  This lowered their AD  and caused the AD curve to shift to the left resulting in a recessionary gap in these  economies 
4,207,Solution to   
5,207,The rise in oil prices increased input cost and shifted the short run AS curve to the left   Because the eastern Asian economies are heavily dependent on imported oil their  economies were more adversely affected than the economy of the United States 
6,207,Solution to   
7,207,The decline in housing prices caused financial institutions in the United States to suffer  large losses on housing related loans and securities  Several large lenders collapsed and  the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve had to intervene to prevent a wave of  bankruptcies among large financial institutions  As a result of the crisis it became  difficult for households and businesses to obtain credit to finance their spending  This  caused AD to fall and increased the severity of the recession in the United States  resulting in a significant decline in US imports and thus exports from the Asian  economies  In addition the financial crisis made it more difficult to get trade finance  further reducing exports from Asia 
8,207,In summary global investors need to be aware of the growing linkages among  economies and the extent that one economy s growth depends on demand from within  as well as from outside of that economy  Data on exports as a percentage of an  economy s GDP provide an indication of this dependence  Although Japan is often  viewed as an export driven economy Exhibit    shows that exports are only    percent  of its GDP  Similarly the economy of India depends largely on domestic spending for  growth because exports account for only    percent of GDP

2,208,       Inflationary Gap
3,208,Increases in AD lead to economic expansions as real GDP and employment increase  If the  expansion drives the economy beyond its production capacity however inflation   will occur   As summarized in Exhibit    higher government spending lower taxes a more optimistic  outlook among consumers and businesses a weaker domestic currency rising equity and  housing prices and an increase in the money supply would each stimulate aggregate demand  and shift the AD curve to the right  If aggregate supply does not increase to match the increase  in AD a rise in the overall level of prices will result 
4,208,In Exhibit    an increase in AD will shift the equilibrium level of GDP from Point A to Point  B  Real output increases from Y  to Y  and the aggregate price level rises from P  to P   As a  result of the increase in aggregate demand companies increase their production and hire more  workers  The unemployment rate declines  Once an economy reaches its potential GDP  however companies must pay higher wages and other input prices to further increase  production  The economy now faces an inflationary gap measured by the difference between Y  andY  in Exhibit     An inflationary gap occurs when the economy s short run level of  equilibrium GDP is above potential GDP resulting in upward pressure on prices 
5,208,Exhibit     Inflationary Gap
6,208,GDP cannot remain at Y  for long because the economy is over utilizing its resources i e   extra shifts of workers are hired and plant and equipment are operating at their maximum  capacity  Eventually workers become tired and plant and equipment wear out  The increase in  the general price level and input prices will set in motion the process of returning the economy  back to potential GDP  Higher wages and input prices shift the SRAS curve to the left  from  SRAS  to SRAS   moving the economy to Point C in Exhibit     Again this self correcting  mechanism may work slowly

2,209,A nation s government and or its central bank can attempt to use the tools of fiscal and  monetary policy to control inflation by shifting the AD curve to the left  AD  to AD  in Exhibit      so that the return to full employment occurs without the price increase  From a fiscal  perspective policymakers can raise taxes or cut government spending  From a monetary  perspective the central bank can reduce bank reserves resulting in a decrease in the growth of  the money supply and higher interest rates 
3,209,Investment Implications of an Increase in AD Resulting in an Inflationary Gap
4,209,If economic statistics  consumer sentiment factory orders for durable and nondurable goods  etc   suggest that there is an expansion caused by an increase in AD the following conditions  are likely to occur 
5,209,  Corporate profits will rise 
6,209,  Commodity prices will increase 
7,209,  Interest rates will rise 
8,209,  Inflationary pressures will build 
9,209,This suggests the following investment strategy 
10,209,  Increase investment in cyclical companies because they are expected to have the largest  increase in earnings 
11,209,  Reduce investments in defensive companies because they are expected to have only a  modest increase in earnings 
12,209,  Increase investments in commodities and commodity oriented equities because they will  benefit from higher production and output 
13,209,  Reduce investments in fixed income securities especially longer maturity securities  because they will decline in price as interest rates rise  Raise exposure to speculative  fixed income securities  junk bonds  because default risks decrease in an economic  expansion 
14,209,       Stagflation  Both High Inflation and High Unemployment
15,209,Structural fluctuations in real GDP are caused by fluctuations in SRAS  Declines in aggregate  supply bring about stagflation high unemployment and increased inflation  Increases in  aggregate supply conversely give rise to high economic growth and low inflation 
16,209,Exhibit    shows the case of a decline in aggregate supply perhaps caused by an unexpected  increase in basic material and oil prices  The equilibrium level of GDP shifts from Point A to B   The economy experiences a recession as GDP falls from Y  to Y  but the price level instead of  falling rises from P  to P   Over time the reduction in output and employment should put  downward pressure on wages and input prices and shift the SRAS curve back to the right re  establishing full employment equilibrium at Point A  However this mechanism may be  painfully slow  Policymakers may use fiscal and monetary policy to shift the AD curve to the  right as previously discussed but at the cost of a permanently higher price level at Point C

2,210,Exhibit     Stagflation
3,210,The global economy experienced stagflation in the mid     s and early     s  Both  unemployment and inflation soared  The problem was caused by a sharp decline in aggregate  supply fueled by higher input prices especially the price of oil  In      the price of oil  quadrupled  A steep global recession began in late      and lasted through early       The  recession was unusual because prices rose rather than declined as would be expected in a  typical demand caused downturn  In           the price of oil doubled  Higher energy prices  shifted the SRAS curve to the left as shown in Exhibit    leading to a global recession in             In the United States the contraction in output was reinforced by the Federal Reserve s  decision to tighten monetary policy to fight the supply induced inflation 
4,210,Investment Implications of Shift in AS
5,210,Labor and raw material costs including energy prices determine the direction of shifts in short  run aggregate supply  Higher costs for labor raw materials and energy lead to a decrease in  aggregate supply resulting in lower economic growth and higher prices  Conversely lower  labor costs raw material prices and energy prices lead to an increase in aggregate supply  resulting in higher economic growth and a lower aggregate price level  Productivity is also an  important factor  Higher rates of productivity growth shift the AS to the right resulting in  higher output and lower unit input prices  Lower rates of productivity growth do the opposite  and shift the AS curve to the left 
6,210,From an investment perspective a decline in AS  leftward shift of the SRAS curve  suggests
7,210,  reducing investment in fixed income because rising output prices  i e  inflation  put  upward pressure on nominal interest rates 
8,210,  reducing investment in most equity securities because profit margins are squeezed and  output declines  and
9,210,  increasing investment in commodities or commodity based companies because prices and  profits are likely to rise

2,211,On the other hand an increase in AS  rightward shift of the SRAS curve  due to higher  productivity growth or lower labor raw material and energy costs is favorable for most asset  classes other than commodities 
3,211,       Conclusions on AD and AS
4,211,The business cycle and the resulting fluctuations in real GDP are caused by shifts in the AD and  AS curves  The impact of these shifts can be summarized as follows 
5,211,  An increase in AD raises real GDP lowers the unemployment rate and increases the  aggregate level of prices 
6,211,  A decrease in AD lowers real GDP increases the unemployment rate and decreases the  aggregate level of prices 
7,211,  An increase in AS raises real GDP lowers the unemployment rate and lowers the  aggregate level of prices 
8,211,  A decrease in AS lowers real GDP raises the unemployment rate and raises the  aggregate level of prices 
9,211,If both curves shift the effect is a combination of the above individual effects  We can look at  four possible cases 
10,211,   Both AD and AS increase  If both AD and AS increase real GDP will increase but the  impact on inflation is not clear unless we know the magnitude of the changes because an  increase in AD will increase the price level whereas an increase in AS will decrease the  price level  If AD increases more than AS the price level will increase  If AS increases  more than AD however the price level will decline 
11,211,   Both AD and AS decrease  If both AD and AS decrease real GDP and employment will  decline but the impact on the price level is not clear unless we know the magnitude of the  changes because a decrease in AD decreases the price level whereas a decrease in AS  increases the price level  If AD decreases more than AS the price level will fall  If AS  decreases more than AD the price level will rise 
12,211,   AD increases and AS decreases  If AD increases and AS declines the price level will  rise but the effect on real GDP is not clear unless we know the magnitude of the changes  because an increase in AD increases real GDP whereas a decrease in AS decreases real  GDP  If AD increases more than AS declines GDP will rise  If AS decreases more than  AD increases real GDP will fall 
13,211,   AD decreases and AS increases  If AD decreases and AS increases the price level will  decline but the impact on real GDP is not clear unless we know the magnitudes of the  changes because a decrease in AD decreases real GDP whereas an increase in AS  increases real GDP  If AD decreases more than AS increases real GDP will fall  If AS  increases more than AD declines real GDP will rise 
14,211,Exhibit    summarizes these four cases

3,212,Effect on Effect on Aggregate Real GDP Price Level Increase Indeterminate Decrease Indeterminate Indeterminate Decrease Indeterminate Increase
4,212,Whether the growth of the economy is demand  or supply driven has an impact on asset prices   Demand driven expansions are normally associated with rising interest rates and inflation  whereas contractions are associated with lower inflation and interest rates  Supply driven  expansions are associated with lower inflation and interest rates whereas supply driven  contractions are associated with rising inflation and interest rates

6,212,Investment Strategy Based on AD and AS  Curves
7,212,An analyst is evaluating the possibility of investing in China Italy Mexico or Brazil   What are the equity and fixed income investment opportunities in these countries based  on the following events 
8,212,   The Chinese government announced a spending plan of      trillion or    percent  of GDP  In addition the central bank of China eased monetary policy resulting in  a surge of lending 
9,212,   The Italian government announced a decline in labor productivity and it expects  this trend to continue into the future 
10,212,   In response to rising inflationary pressure the Mexican central bank tightened  monetary policy and the government announced tax increases and spending cuts  to balance the budget 
11,212,   A major discovery of oil off the coast of Brazil lowered oil prices while the  Brazilian government announced a major increase in spending on public  infrastructure to stimulate the economy 
12,212,Solution to   
13,212,Stimulative fiscal and monetary policies should result in a demand driven expansion   Investors should reduce investments in fixed income securities and defensive companies  and invest in cyclical companies and commodities  As a result the prospects for growth  oriented equity investments look favorable in China

2,213,Solution to   
3,213,A decline in labor productivity will result in a decline in AS  i e  the AS curve will shift  to the left  This is typically a poor investment environment  Investors should reduce  investments in both fixed income and equity securities and invest in commodities  Entry  into Italian stocks and bonds does not look attractive 
4,213,Solution to   
5,213,The policy measures put in place by the Mexican government and central bank will  cause a drop in AD and likely result in a recession  Investors should increase their  investments in fixed income securities because interest rates will most likely decline as  the recession deepens  This is a poor environment for equity securities 
6,213,Solution to   
7,213,This is a situation where both the AD and AS curves will shift  The increase in spending  on public infrastructure will shift the AD curve to the right resulting in higher aggregate  expenditures and prices  Lower oil prices will shift the AS curve to the right resulting in  higher GDP but lower prices  Thus GDP will clearly increase but the impact on prices  and inflation is indeterminate  As a result investors should increase their investment in  equity securities  however the impact on fixed income securities is unclear 
8,213,EXAMPLE   
9,213,Using AD and AS to Explain Japan s  Economic Problem
10,213,Japan has experienced sluggish growth in real GDP for nearly two decades following  the bursting of an asset and investment bubble in the late     s  At the same time Japan  has experienced deflation  declining prices  over this period  The reasons for this  protracted period of stagnation continue to be debated among economists  Failure to  recognize a change in the Japanese growth rate has hurt many investors especially those  taking a long term perspective  From their peak in      Japanese equity prices as  measured by the Nikkei index fell by over    percent before bottoming out in mid        Since that time the market has been essentially flat despite considerable volatility 
11,213,The performance of the Japanese economy can be explained using the AD and AS  model  The protracted slowdown of growth in Japan beginning in the early     s can be  linked to the effect of the collapse of the equity and commercial real estate markets in  the late     s and to excessive investment in capital goods  new factories and  equipment  in the     s  These problems were compounded by persistent weakness in  the banking sector a profound lack of confidence among businesses and consumers and  negative demographics with slow growth in the working age population 
12,213,The sum of these developments caused a decline in both the AD and AS curves   Aggregate demand declined causing the AD curve to shift to the left for the following  reasons

2,214,  The wealth effect due to the decline in equity and real estate prices sharply  reduced consumption spending  Asset prices have yet to recover from the fall 
3,214,  Excessive investment in capital goods caused a sharp decline in business  investment 
4,214,  Lack of confidence among businesses and consumers 
5,214,  Problems in the banking sector made monetary policy ineffective because banks  were unable to lend which negatively affected both consumer and business  spending 
6,214,AS declined for the following reasons 
7,214,  Marked slowing in private investment spending reduced the capital stock  This  also reduced potential GDP 
8,214,  Slow population growth limited the growth in the labor supply  This also reduced  potential GDP 
9,214,  Higher energy prices slowed growth because of Japan s heavy dependence on  imported energy 
10,214,As would be expected the declines in both AD and AS resulted in slow GDP growth   The fact that prices fell indicates that the AD curve shifted more than the AS curve 
11,214,   ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
12,214,We now shift focus from the short run cyclical movement of the economy to its long term  growth rate  Economic growth is calculated as the annual percentage change in real GDP or the  annual change in real per capita GDP 
13,214,  Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding 
14,214,  Per capita GDP defined as real GDP divided by population determines the standard of  living in each country and the ability of the average person to buy goods and services 
15,214,Economic growth is important because rapid growth in per capita real GDP can transform a  poor nation into a wealthy one  Even small differences in the growth rate of per capita GDP if  sustained over time have a large impact on an economy s standard of living  One should think  of the growth rate of GDP as the equivalent of a rate of return on a portfolio  Small differences  in return compounded over many years make a big difference  Nevertheless there is a limit to  how fast an economy can grow  Faster growth is not always better for an economy because  there are costs associated with excess growth such as higher inflation potential environmental  damage and the lower consumption and higher savings needed to finance the growth

2,215,This raises the issue of sustainable growth which requires an understanding of the concept of  potential GDP  Recall that potential GDP measures the productive capacity of the economy and  is the level of real GDP that an economy could produce if capital and labor are fully employed   In order to grow over time an economy must add to its productive capacity  Thus the  sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the economy s  productive capacity or potential GDP  It is important to note that economists cannot directly  measure potential output  Instead they estimate it using a variety of techniques discussed later  in this reading 
3,215,For global investors estimating the sustainable rate of economic growth for an economy is  important for both asset allocation and security selection decisions  Investors need to  understand how the rate of economic growth differs among countries and whether these growth  rates are sustainable  When examining the GDP data global investors need to address a number  of questions including the following 
4,215,   What are the underlying determinants or sources of growth for the country 
5,215,   Are these sources of growth likely to remain stable or change over time 
6,215,   How can we measure and forecast sustainable growth for different countries 
7,215,     The Production Function and Potential GDP
8,215,The neoclassical or Solow growth model is the framework used to determine the underlying  sources of growth for an economy  The model shows that the economy s productive capacity  and potential GDP increase for two reasons 
9,215,   accumulation of such inputs as capital labor and raw materials used in production and
10,215,   discovery and application of new technologies that make the inputs in the production  process more productive that is able to produce more goods and services for the same  amount of input 
11,215,The model is based on a production function that provides the quantitative link between the  level of output that the economy can produce and the inputs used in the production process  given the state of technology  A two factor production function with labor and capital as the  inputs is expressed mathematically as

13,215,where Y denotes the level of aggregate output in the economy L is the quantity of labor or  number of workers in the economy K is the capital stock or the equipment and structures used  to produce goods and services and A represents technological knowledge or total factor  productivity  TFP   TFP is a scale factor that reflects the portion of growth that is not  accounted for by the capital and labor inputs  The main factor influencing TFP is technological  change  Like potential GDP TFP is not directly observed in the economy and must be  estimated 
14,215,The production function shows that output in the economy depends on inputs and the level of  technology  The economy s capacity to produce goods grows when these inputs increase and or  technology advances  The more technologically advanced an economy is the more output it is  able to produce from a given amount of inputs

2,216,Two assumptions about the production function provide a link to microeconomics  First we  assume that the production function has constant returns to scale  This means that if all the  inputs in the production process are increased by the same percentage then output will rise by  that percentage  Thus doubling all inputs would double output  Second we assume that the  production function exhibits diminishing marginal productivity with respect to any  individual input  This property plays an important role in assessing the contribution of labor and  capital to economic growth  Marginal productivity looks at the extra output that is produced  from a one unit increase in an input if the other inputs are unchanged  It applies to any input as  long as the other inputs are held constant  For example if we have a factory of a fixed size and  we add more workers to the factory the marginal productivity of labor measures how much  additional output each additional worker will produce 
3,216,Diminishing marginal productivity means that at some point the extra output obtained from  each additional unit of the input will decline  In the above example if we hire more workers at  the existing factory  fixed capital input in this case  output will rise by a smaller and smaller  amount with each additional worker  Traditionally economists focused on the labor input and  how the productivity of labor would decline given a fixed amount of land  The traditional  growth theory where labor is the only  variable  input was developed by Thomas Malthus in  his      publication Essay on the Principle of Population  Malthus argued that as the  population and labor force grew the additional output produced by an additional worker would  decline essentially to zero and there would be no long term economic growth  This gloomy  forecast caused others to label economics the  dismal science  
4,216,The dire prediction implied by declining marginal productivity of labor never materialized and  economists changed the focus of the analysis away from labor to capital  In this case if we add  more and more capital to a fixed number of workers the amount of additional output  contributed by each additional amount of capital will fall  Thus if capital grows faster than  labor capital will become less productive resulting in slower and slower growth  Diminishing  marginal productivity of capital has two major implications for potential GDP 
5,216,   Long term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on capital deepening investment that  increases the stock of capital relative to labor  More generally increasing the supply of  some input s  relative to other inputs will lead to diminishing returns and cannot be the  basis for sustainable growth 
6,216,   Given the relative scarcity and hence high productivity of capital in developing countries  the growth rates of developing countries should exceed those of developed countries  As  a result there should be a convergence of incomes between developed and developing  countries over time 
7,216,Because of diminishing returns to capital the only way to sustain growth in potential GDP per  capita is through technological change or growth in total factor productivity  This results in an  upward shift in the production function  The economy produces more goods and services using  the same level of labor and capital inputs  In terms of the formal production function shown  above this is reflected by an increase in the technology parameter A 
8,216,Using the production function Robert Solow developed a model that explained the contribution  of labor capital and technology  total factor productivity  to economic growth  The growth  accounting equation shows that the rate of growth of potential output equals growth in  technology plus the weighted average growth rate of labor and capital 
9,216,Growth in potential GDP   Growth in technology   WL  Growth in labor     WC  Growth in capital

2,217,where WL and WC are the relative shares of capital and labor in national income  The capital  share is the sum of corporate profits net interest income net rental income and depreciation  divided by GDP  The labor share is employee compensation divided by GDP  For the United  States WL and WC are roughly     and     respectively 
3,217,The growth accounting equation highlights a key point  The contribution of labor and capital to  long term growth depends on their respective shares of national income  For the United States  because labor s share is higher an increase in the growth rate of labor will have a significantly  larger impact  roughly double  on potential GDP growth than will an equivalent increase in the  growth rate of capital 
4,217,The growth accounting equation can be further modified to explain growth in per capita GDP   Because it measures the standard of living and purchasing power of the average person in an  economy per capita GDP is more relevant than the absolute level of GDP in comparing  economic performance among countries  Transforming the growth accounting equation into per  capita terms results in the following equation 
5,217,Growth in per capita potential GDP   Growth in technology   WC  Growth in capital to  labor ratio 
6,217,The capital to labor ratio measures the amount of capital available per worker and is weighted  by the share of capital in national income  Because capital s share in national income in the US  economy is     a   percent increase in the amount of capital available for each worker  increases per capita output by only     percent  The equation shows that improvements in  technology are more important than capital in raising an economy s standard of living 
7,217,     Sources of Economic Growth
8,217,The growth accounting equation focuses on the main determinants of growth capital labor  and technology and omits a number of other sources of growth to simplify the analysis  For  many countries however natural resource and human capital inputs play an important role in  explaining economic growth  Therefore there are five important sources of growth for an  economy 
9,217,  Labor supply 
10,217,  Human capital 
11,217,  Physical capital 
12,217,  Technology  and
13,217,  Natural resources 
14,217,These sources of growth determine the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services

2,218,Labor Supply
3,218,Growth in the number of people available for work  quantity of workforce  is an important  source of economic growth and partially accounts for the superior growth performance among  the advanced economies of the US economy versus the European and Japanese economies   Most developing countries such as China India and Mexico have a large potential labor  supply  We can measure the potential size of the labor input as the total number of hours  available for work which is given by
4,218,Total hours worked   Labor force   Average hours worked per worker
5,218,The labor force is defined as the portion of the working age population  over the age of      that is employed or available for work but not working  unemployed   The contribution of labor  to overall output is also affected by changes in the average hours worked per worker  Average  hours worked is highly sensitive to the business cycle  However the long term trend has been  toward a shorter workweek in the advanced countries  This development is the result of  legislation collective bargaining agreements and the growth of part time and temporary work 
6,218,Human Capital
7,218,In addition to the quantity of labor the quality of the labor force is important  Human capital is  the accumulated knowledge and skill that workers acquire from education training and life  experience  It measures the quality of the workforce  In general better educated and skilled  workers will be more productive and more adaptable to changes in technology 
8,218,An economy s human capital is increased through investment in education and on the job  training  Like physical capital investment in education is costly  Studies show that there is a  significant return on education  That is people with more education earn higher wages   Moreover education may also have a spillover or externality impact  Increasing the educational  level of one person not only raises the output of that person but also the output of those around  him or her  The spillover effect operates through the link between education and advances in  technology  Education not only improves the quality of the labor force but also encourages  growth through innovation  Investment in health is also a major contributor to human capital  especially in developing countries 
9,218,Physical Capital Stock
10,218,The physical capital stock  accumulated amount of buildings machinery and equipment used  to produce goods and services  increases from year to year as long as net investment  gross  investment less depreciation of capital  is positive  Thus countries with a higher rate of  investment should have a growing physical capital stock and a higher rate of GDP growth   Exhibit    shows the level of business investment as a share of GDP  The exhibit shows  significant variation across countries with the investment share in the United States being low  in comparison to other developed countries

2,219,As is evident in Exhibit    the correlation between economic growth and investment is high   Economies that devote a large share of GDP to investment such as China India and South  Korea have high growth rates  The fastest growing economies in Europe over the last decade  Ireland and Spain have the highest investment to GDP ratios  Economies that devote a smaller  share of GDP to investment such as Brazil and Mexico have slower growth rates  The data  show why the Chinese economy has expanded at such a rapid rate achieving an annual GDP  growth rate of over    percent over the last two decades  Investment spending in China on new  factories equipment and infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is the highest in the world

2,220,Technology
3,220,The most important factor affecting economic growth is technology especially in developed  countries such as the United States  Technology refers to the process a company uses to  transform inputs into outputs  Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to  produce more or higher quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs  At the  same time technological progress results in the creation of new goods and services  Finally  technological progress improves how efficiently businesses are organized and managed 
4,220,Technological advances are very important because they allow an economy to overcome the  limits imposed by diminishing marginal returns  Thus an economy will face limits to growth if  it relies exclusively on expanding the inputs or factors of production 
5,220,Because most technological change is embodied in new machinery equipment and software  physical capital must be replaced and perhaps expanded in order to take advantage of changes  in technology  One of the key drivers of growth in developed countries over the last decade has  been the information technology  IT  sector  Growth in the IT sector has been driven by  technological innovation that has caused the price of key technologies such as semiconductors  to fall dramatically  The steep declines in prices have encouraged investment in IT at the  expense of other assets  The sector has grown very fast and has made a significant contribution  to economic growth employment and exports 
6,220,Countries can innovate through expenditures both public and private on research and  development  R D   Thus expenditures on R D and the number of patents issued although  not directly measuring innovation provide some useful insight into innovative performance   Countries can also acquire new technology through imitation or copying the technology  developed elsewhere  The embodiment of technology in capital goods can also enable relatively  poor countries to jump ahead of the technology leaders 
7,220,Total factor productivity  TFP  is the component of productivity that proxies technological  progress and organizational innovation  TFP is the amount by which output would rise because  of improvements in the production process  It is calculated as a residual the difference between  the growth rate of potential output and the weighted average growth rate of capital and labor   Specifically
8,220,TFP growth   Growth in potential GDP    WL  Growth in labor    WC  Growth in capital  
9,220,Natural Resources
10,220,Raw materials are an essential input to growth and include everything from available land to oil  to water  Historically consumption of raw materials has increased as economies have grown   There are two categories of natural resources 
11,220,   Renewable resources are those that can be replenished such as a forest  For example  if a tree is cut a seedling can be planted and a new forest harvested in the future 
12,220,   Non renewable resources are finite resources that are depleted once they are  consumed  Oil and coal are examples

2,221,Natural resources account for some of the differences in growth among countries  Today such  countries as Brazil and Australia as well as those in the Middle East have relatively high per  capita incomes because of their resource base  Countries in the Middle East have large pools of  oil  Brazil has an abundance of land suitable for large scale agricultural production making it a  major exporter of coffee soybeans and beef 
3,221,Even though natural resources are important they are not necessary for a country to achieve a  high level of income provided it can acquire the requisite inputs through trade  Countries in  eastern Asia such as Japan and South Korea have experienced rapid economic growth but own  few natural resources 
4,221,     Measures of Sustainable Growth
5,221,Measuring how fast an economy can grow is an important exercise  Economists project  potential GDP into the future to forecast the sustainable growth path for the economy  An  economy s potential GDP is an unobserved concept that is approximated using a number of  alternative methods  It is important to note that estimates of the economy s potential growth can  change as new data become available  Being able to understand such a change is critical for  financial analysts because equity returns are highly dependent on the sustainable rate of  economic growth 
6,221,We discussed in the previous section that the growth rate of potential GDP depends on the rate  of technological progress as well as the growth rate of
7,221,  the labor force 
8,221,  physical and human capital  and
9,221,  natural resources 
10,221,How can we summarize all of these forces driving economic growth and develop a method to  measure estimate the growth rate of potential GDP  One way is to use the growth accounting  equation discussed in Section     
11,221,Growth in potential GDP   Growth in technology   WL  Growth in labor     WC  Growth in capital 
12,221,The problem with this approach is that there are no observed data on potential GDP or on total  factor productivity and both must be estimated  In addition data on the capital stock and the  labor and capital shares of national income are not available for many countries especially the  developing countries 
13,221,As an alternative we can focus on the productivity of the labor force where we generally have  more reliable data  Labor productivity is defined as the quantity of goods and services  real  GDP  that a worker can produce in one hour of work  Our standard of living improves if we  produce more goods and services for each hour of work  Labor productivity is calculated as real  GDP for a given year divided by the total number of hours worked in that year counting all  workers  We use total hours rather than the number of workers to adjust for the fact that not  everyone works the same number of hours 
14,221,Labor productivity   Real GDP Aggregate hours

2,222,Therefore we need to understand the forces that make labor more productive  Productivity is  determined by the factors that we examined in the preceding section  education and skill of  workers  human capital  investments in physical capital and improvements in technology  An  increase in any of these factors will increase the productivity of the labor force  The factors  determining labor productivity can be derived from the production functions under the  assumption of constant returns to scale where a doubling of inputs causes output to double as  well  Dividing the production function by   L we get the following 
3,222,Y L  AF  K L 
4,222,where Y L is output per worker which is a measure of labor productivity  The equation states  that labor productivity depends on physical capital per worker  K L  and technology  A   Recall  that  A  can also be interpreted as total factor productivity  As this equation indicates labor  productivity and total factor productivity are related but distinct concepts  TFP is a scale factor  that does not depend on the mix of inputs  Changes in TFP are measured as a residual capturing  growth that cannot be attributed to specific inputs  On the other hand as shown in this equation  labor productivity output per worker depends on both the general level of productivity   reflected in TFP  and the mix of inputs  Increases in either TFP or the capital to labor ratio  boost labor productivity  Because both output and labor input can be observed labor  productivity can be measured directly 
5,222,Labor productivity is a key concept for measuring the health and prosperity of an economy and  its sustainable rate of growth  An analyst examining the growth prospects for an economy needs  to focus on the labor productivity data for that country  Labor productivity largely explains the  differences in the living standards and the long term sustainable growth rates among countries   The distinction between the level and growth rate of productivity is important to understand   Exhibit    provides such a comparison for selected countries

7,223,Level of Labor Productivity
8,223,The higher the level of labor productivity the more goods and services the economy can  produce with the same number of workers  The level of labor productivity depends on the  accumulated stock of human and physical capital and is much higher in the developed  countries  For example China has a population of over     billion people compared with over      million people in the United States  Because of its much larger population China has  significantly more workers than the United States  The US economy as measured by real GDP  is much larger however  As shown in Exhibit    the United States has the highest level of  productivity in the world producing over     of GDP per hour worked  Similarly workers in  France Germany and Ireland have high levels of productivity  In comparison Mexican  workers produce only       worth of GDP per hour worked  Thus US workers are nearly three  times more productive than Mexican workers 
9,223,Growth Rate of Labor Productivity
10,223,The growth rate of labor productivity is the percentage increase in productivity over a year  It is  among the economic statistics that economists and financial analysts watch most closely  In  contrast to the level of productivity the growth rate of productivity is typically higher in the  developing countries where human and physical capital is scarce but growing rapidly 
11,223,If productivity growth is rapid it means the same number of workers can produce more and  more goods and services  In this case companies can afford to pay higher wages and still make  a profit  Thus high rates of productivity growth will translate into rising profits and higher  stock prices 
12,223,In contrast persistently low productivity growth suggests the economy is in bad shape  Without  productivity gains businesses have to either cut wages or boost prices in order to increase profit  margins  Low rates of productivity growth should be associated with slow growth in profits and  flat or declining stock prices

2,224,Prospects for Equity Returns in Mexico
3,224,John Todd CFA manages a global mutual fund with nearly    percent of its assets  invested in Europe  Because of the low population growth rate he is concerned about  the long term outlook for the European economies  With potentially slower economic  growth in Europe the environment for equities may be less attractive  Therefore he is  considering reallocating some of the assets from Europe to Mexico  Based on the data in  Exhibits    and    do you think that investment opportunities are favorable in Mexico   According to the OECD the Mexican population increased by     percent in       compared with a     percent increase in the European Union     countries  
4,224,Solution 
5,224,Other than the higher population growth rate the potential sources of growth for Mexico  are not favorable  The level of business investment  Exhibit     in Mexico is quite low  especially in comparison to China and even below that of many of the advanced  economies in Europe such as Spain and Italy  The level of labor productivity in Mexico  is well below that in most European countries  This is not surprising given that the  amount of capital per worker in Mexico is much lower than that in Europe  What is  surprising and of concern is the rate of labor productivity growth in Mexico  Labor  productivity in Mexico is growing at a     percent annual rate well below that of  Germany France and the United Kingdom  This means that the rightward shift in the  AS curve is greater for the European countries than for Mexico despite the more  favorable demographic trend in Mexico  In addition it implies that there is more  potential for expanding profit margins in Europe than in Mexico  Thus the analysis of  potential growth does not suggest a favorable outlook for equity returns in Mexico  In  the absence of more favorable considerations e g  compelling equity valuations John  Todd should decide not to reallocate assets from Europe to Mexico 
6,224,Measuring Sustainable Growth
7,224,Labor productivity data can be used to estimate the rate of sustainable growth of the economy   A useful way to describe potential GDP is as a combination of aggregate hours worked and the  productivity of those workers 
8,224,Potential GDP   Aggregate hours worked   Labor productivity
9,224,Transforming the above equation into growth rates we get the following 
10,224,Potential growth rate   Long term growth rate of labor force   Long  term labor productivity growth rate
11,224,Thus potential growth is a combination of the long term growth rate of the labor force and the  long term growth rate of labor productivity  Therefore if the labor force is growing at   percent  per year and productivity per worker is rising at   percent per year then potential GDP   adjusted for inflation  is rising at   percent per year

24,225,Solution 
25,225,Potential GDP is calculated as the sum of the trend growth rate in the labor force and the  trend growth rate in labor productivity  The growth in the labor force can differ from the  population growth rate because of changes in the labor force participation rate and  changes in hours worked per person  Estimating based on the average for the last two  decades gives

6,226,The most striking result is the difference in labor force growth in Germany and Japan in  contrast to that in the United States and Canada  Most of the difference between the  growth rates in potential GDP among these countries can be explained by the  demographic factor  The results suggest that Japan s sluggish growth over the last two  decades is likely to continue  The weak productivity growth in Canada is of concern and  is indicative of a low rate of innovation among Canadian companies

12,226,Canada Germany Japan United States
13,226,To evaluate the future prospects for fixed income investments analysts must estimate  the future rate of inflation and assess the possibility of changes in monetary policy by  the central bank  An important indicator for both of these factors is the degree of slack  in the economy  One way to measure the degree of slack in the economy is to compare  the growth rates of actual GDP and potential GDP 
14,226,Based on the estimates of potential GDP from the previous example and the information  in Exhibit    evaluate the prospects for fixed income investments in each of the  countries

2,227,In comparing the OECD forecast for GDP growth with the estimated growth rate in  potential GDP there are two cases to consider 
3,227,   If actual GDP is growing at a faster rate than potential GDP it signals growing  inflationary pressures and an increased likelihood that the central bank will raise  interest rates 
4,227,   If actual GDP is growing at a slower rate than potential GDP it signals growing  resource slack less inflationary pressures and an increased likelihood that the  central bank will reduce rates or leave them unchanged

8,227,Canada Germany Japan United States
9,227,The data suggest that inflationary pressure will grow in the United States and Canada  and that both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada will eventually raise interest  rates  Thus the environment for bond investing is not favorable in the United States and  Canada because bond prices are likely to decline 
10,227,With Germany growing at its potential rate of GDP growth the rate of inflation should  neither rise nor fall  Monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank  ECB  but  data on the German economy play a big role in the ECB s decision  Based on the above  data no change in ECB policy is likely  For bond investors little change in bond prices  is likely in Germany so investors need to focus on the interest  coupon  income  received from the bond 
11,227,Finally growing resource slack in Japan will put downward pressure on inflation and  may force the Bank of Japan to keep rates low  Bond prices should rise in this  environment

2,228,SUMMARY
3,228,This reading introduces important macroeconomic concepts and principles for macroeconomic  forecasting and related investment decision making  Macroeconomics examines the economy as  a whole by focusing on a country s aggregate output of final goods and services total income  aggregate expenditures and the general price level  The first step in macroeconomic analysis is  to measure the size of an economy  Gross domestic product enables us to assign a monetary  value to an economy s level of output or aggregate expenditures  The interaction of aggregate  demand and aggregate supply determines the level of GDP as well as the general price level   The business cycle reflects shifts in aggregate demand and short run aggregate supply  The  long term sustainable growth rate of the economy depends on growth in the supply and quality  of inputs  labor capital and natural resources  and advances in technology  From an investment  perspective macroeconomic analysis and forecasting are important because business profits  asset valuations interest rates and inflation rates depend on the business cycle in the short to  intermediate term and on the drivers of sustainable economic growth in the long term  In  addition it is important to understand fiscal and monetary policies  economic impact on and  implications for inflation household consumption and saving capital investment and exports 
4,228,  GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a  given time period 
5,228,  GDP can be valued by looking at either the total amount spent on goods and services  produced in the economy or the income generated in producing those goods and services 
6,228,  GDP counts only final purchases of newly produced goods and services during the  current time period  Transfer payments and capital gains are excluded from GDP 
7,228,  With the exception of owner occupied housing and government services which are  estimated at imputed values GDP includes only goods and services that are valued by  being sold in the market 
8,228,  Intermediate goods are excluded from GDP in order to avoid double counting 
9,228,  GDP can be measured either from the value of final output or by summing the value  added at each stage of the production and distribution process  The sum of the value  added by each stage is equal to the final selling price of the good 
10,228,  Nominal GDP is the value of production using the prices of the current year  Real GDP  measures production using the constant prices of a base year  The GDP deflator equals  the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP 
11,228,  Households earn income in exchange for providing directly or indirectly through  ownership of businesses the factors of production  labor capital natural resources  including land   From this income they consume save and pay net taxes 
12,228,  Businesses produce most of the economy s output income and invest to maintain and  expand productive capacity  Companies retain some earnings but pay out most of their  revenue as income to the household sector and as taxes to the government

2,229,  The government sector collects taxes from households and businesses and purchases  goods and services from the private business sector 
3,229,  Foreign trade consists of exports and imports  The difference between the two is net  exports  If net exports are positive  negative  then the country spends less  more  than it  earns  Net exports are balanced by accumulation of either claims on the rest of the world   net exports      or obligations to the rest of the world  net exports      
4,229,  Capital markets provide a link between saving and investment in the economy 
5,229,  From the expenditure side GDP includes personal consumption  C  gross private  domestic investment  I  government spending  G  and net exports  X   M  
6,229,  The major categories of expenditure are often broken down into subcategories  Gross  private domestic investment includes both investment in fixed assets  plant and  equipment  and the change in inventories  In some countries government investment  spending is separated from other government spending 
7,229,  National income is the income received by all factors of production used in the generation  of final output  It equals GDP minus the capital consumption allowance  depreciation   and a statistical discrepancy 
8,229,  Personal income reflects pre tax income received by households  It equals national  income plus transfers minus undistributed corporate profits corporate income taxes and  indirect business taxes 
9,229,  Personal disposable income equals personal income minus personal taxes 
10,229,  Private saving must equal investment plus the fiscal and trade deficits  That is S   I    G   T     X   M  
11,229,  Consumption spending is a function of disposable income  The marginal propensity to  consume represents the fraction of an additional unit of disposable income that is spent 
12,229,  Investment spending depends on the average interest rate and the level of aggregate  income  Government purchases and tax policy are often considered to be exogenous  variables determined outside the macroeconomic model  Actual taxes collected depend  on income and are therefore endogenous that is determined within the model 
13,229,  The IS curve reflects combinations of GDP and the real interest rate such that aggregate  income output equals planned expenditures  The LM curve reflects combinations of GDP  and the interest rate such that demand and supply of real money balances are equal 
14,229,  Combining the IS and LM relationships yields the aggregate demand curve 
15,229,  Aggregate demand and aggregate supply determine the level of real GDP and the price  level 
16,229,  The aggregate demand curve is the relationship between real output  GDP  demanded and  the price level holding underlying factors constant  Movements along the aggregate  demand curve reflect the impact of price on demand

2,230,  The aggregate demand curve is downward sloping because a rise in the price level  reduces wealth raises real interest rates and raises the price of domestically produced  goods versus foreign goods  The aggregate demand curve is drawn assuming a constant  money supply 
3,230,  The aggregate demand curve will shift if there is a change in a factor other than price  that affects aggregate demand  These factors include household wealth consumer and  business expectations capacity utilization monetary policy fiscal policy exchange rates  and foreign GDP 
4,230,  The aggregate supply curve is the relationship between the quantity of real GDP supplied  and the price level keeping all other factors constant  Movements along the supply curve  reflect the impact of price on supply 
5,230,  The short run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping because higher prices result in  higher profits and induce businesses to produce more and laborers to work more  In the  short run some prices are sticky implying that some prices do not adjust to changes in  demand 
6,230,  In the long run all prices are assumed to be flexible  The long run aggregate supply curve  is vertical because input costs adjust to changes in output prices leaving the optimal level  of output unchanged  The position of the curve is determined by the economy s level of  potential GDP 
7,230,  The level of potential output also called the full employment or natural level of output is  unobservable and difficult to measure precisely  This concept represents an efficient and  unconstrained level of production at which companies have enough spare capacity to  avoid bottlenecks and there is a balance between the pool of unemployed workers and the  pool of job openings 
8,230,  The long run aggregate supply curve will shift because of changes in labor supply supply  of physical and human capital and productivity technology 
9,230,  The short run supply curve will shift because of changes in potential GDP nominal  wages input prices expectations about future prices business taxes and subsidies and  the exchange rate 
10,230,  The business cycle and short term fluctuations in GDP are caused by shifts in aggregate  demand and aggregate supply 
11,230,  When the level of GDP in the economy is below potential GDP such a recessionary  situation exerts downward pressure on the aggregate price level 
12,230,  When the level of GDP is above potential GDP such an overheated situation puts upward  pressure on the aggregate price level 
13,230,  Stagflation a combination of high inflation and weak economic growth is caused by a  decline in short run aggregate supply 
14,230,  The sustainable rate of economic growth is measured by the rate of increase in the  economy s productive capacity or potential GDP

2,231,  Growth in real GDP measures how rapidly the total economy is expanding  Per capita  GDP defined as real GDP divided by population reflects the standard of living in a  country  Real GDP growth rates and levels of per capita GDP vary widely among  countries 
3,231,  The sources of economic growth include the supply of labor the supply of physical and  human capital raw materials and technological knowledge 
4,231,  Output can be described in terms of a production function  For example Y   AF LK   where L is the quantity of labor K is the capital stock and A represents technological  knowledge or total factor productivity  The function F    is assumed to exhibit constant  returns to scale but diminishing marginal productivity for each input individually 
5,231,  Total factor productivity is a scale factor that reflects the portion of output growth that is  not accounted for by changes in the capital and labor inputs  TFP is mainly a reflection of  technological change 
6,231,  Based on a two factor production function Potential GDP growth   Growth in TFP   WL  Growth in labor    WC  Growth in capital  where WL and WC        WL  are the shares of  labor and capital in GDP 
7,231,  Diminishing marginal productivity implies that
8,231,  Increasing the supply of some input s  relative to other inputs will lead to  diminishing returns and cannot be the basis for sustainable growth  In particular  long term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on capital deepening that is  increasing the stock of capital relative to labor 
9,231,  Given the relative scarcity and hence high productivity of capital in developing  countries the growth rate of developing countries should exceed that of developed  countries 
10,231,  The labor supply is determined by population growth the labor force participation rate  and net immigration  The capital stock in a country increases with investment   Correlation between long run economic growth and the rate of investment is high 
11,231,  In addition to labor capital and technology human capital essentially the quality of  the labor force and natural resources are important determinants of output and growth 
12,231,  Technological advances are discoveries that make it possible to produce more and or  higher quality goods and services with the same resources or inputs  Technology is the  main factor affecting economic growth in developed countries 
13,231,  The sustainable rate of growth in an economy is determined by the growth rate of the  labor supply plus the growth rate of labor productivity

7,238,   B is correct  GDP is the total amount spent on all final goods and services produced  within the economy over a specific period of time 
8,238,   C is correct  By products of production processes that have no explicit market value are  not included in GDP 
9,238,   C is correct  Government transfer payments such as unemployment compensation or  welfare benefits are excluded from GDP 
10,238,   A is correct  Canadian GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services  produced in a given time period within Canada  The wine was produced in Canada and  counts towards Canadian GDP 
11,238,   B is correct  This is the value added by the artist                        
12,238,   B is correct  The GDP Deflator   Nominal GDP Real GDP  To get a ratio less than   real  GDP exceeds nominal GDP which indicates that prices have decreased and accordingly  deflation has occurred 
13,238,   A is correct  Nominal GDP is defined as the value of goods and services measured at  current prices  Expenditure is used synonymously with the value of goods and services  since aggregate expenditures must equal aggregate output of an economy 
14,238,   B is correct  Real GDP in the first year was      billion            and in the last year it  was      billion              Thus                         or

2,239,    A is correct  The fundamental relationship among saving investment the fiscal balance  and the trade balance is S   I    G   T     X   M   This form of the relationship shows  that private saving must fund investment expenditures the government fiscal balance  and net exports    net capital outflows   Rearranging gives G   T    S   I     X   M   The  government s fiscal deficit  G   T  must be equal to the private sector s  saving investment balance  S   I  minus net exports 
3,239,    C is correct  The fundamental relationship among saving investment the fiscal balance  and the trade balance is S   I    G   T     X   M   Given the levels of output and  investment spending an increase in saving  reduction in consumption  must be offset by  either an increase in the fiscal deficit or an increase in net exports  Increasing the fiscal  deficit is not one of the choices so an increase in net exports and corresponding increase  in net capital outflows  increased lending to foreigners and or increased purchases of  assets from foreigners  is the correct response 
4,239,    A is correct  The IS curve represents combinations of income and the real interest rate at  which planned expenditure equals income 
5,239,    B is correct  The IS curve represents combinations of income and the real interest rate at  which planned expenditure equals income  Equivalently it represents combinations such  that
6,239,S Y    I r     G   T     X   M 
7,239,where S Y  indicates that planned saving is a  increasing  function of income and I r   indicates that planned investment is a  decreasing  function of the real interest rate  To  maintain this relationship an increase in government spending  G  requires an increase in  saving at any given level of the interest rate  r   This implies an increase in income  Y  at  each interest rate level a rightward shift of the IS curve  Unless the LM curve is  vertical the IS and LM curves will intersect at a higher level of aggregate  expenditure income  Since the LM curve embodies a constant price level this implies an  increase in aggregate expenditure at each price level a rightward shift of the Aggregate  Demand curve 
8,239,    C is correct  The LM curve represents combinations of income and the interest rate at  which the demand for real money balances equals the supply  For a given price level an  increase in the nominal money supply is also an increase in the real money supply  To  increase the demand for real money balances either the interest must decline or income  must increase  Therefore at each level of the interest rate income    expenditure  must  increase a rightward shift of the LM curve  Since the IS curve is downward sloping   higher income requires a lower interest rate  a rightward shift in the LM curve means  that the IS and LM curves will intersect at a higher level of aggregate  expenditure income  This implies a higher level of aggregate expenditure at each price  level a rightward shift of the Aggregate Demand curve 
9,239,    B is correct  The LM curve represents combinations of income and the interest rate at  which the demand for real money balances equals the supply  For a given nominal money  supply an increase in the price level implies a decrease in the real money supply  To  decrease the demand for real money balances either the interest must increase or income  must decrease  Therefore at each level of the interest rate income    expenditure  must  decrease a leftward shift of the LM curve

2,240,    A is correct  A decrease in the price level increases the real money supply and shifts the  LM curve to the right  Since the IS curve is downward sloping the IS and LM curves will  intersect at a higher level of income and a lower interest rate 
3,240,    C is correct  At the full employment or natural level of output the economy is operating  at an efficient and unconstrained level of production  Companies have enough spare  capacity to avoid bottlenecks and there is a modest stable pool of unemployed workers   job seekers equal job vacancies  looking for and transitioning into new jobs 
4,240,    C is correct  Due to long term contracts and other rigidities wages and other input costs  do not fully adjust to changes in the price level in the short run  Given input prices firms  respond to output price changes by expanding or contracting output to maximize profit   Hence the SRAS is upward sloping 
5,240,    B is correct  The slope of the short run aggregate supply curve reflects the extent to  which wages and other input costs adjust to the overall price level  Automatic adjustment  of wages would mitigate the impact of price changes on profitability  Hence firms would  not adjust output as much in response to changing output prices the SRAS curve would  be steeper 
6,240,    B is correct  A weak domestic currency will result in an increase in aggregate demand at  each price level a rightward shift in the AD curve  A weaker currency will cause a  country s exports to be cheaper in global markets  Conversely imports will be more  expensive for domestic buyers  Hence the net exports component of aggregate demand  will increase 
7,240,    B is correct  Productivity measures the efficiency of labor and is the amount of output  produced by workers in a given period of time  A decline in productivity implies  decreased efficiency  A decline in productivity increases labor costs decreases  profitability and results in lower output at each output price level a leftward shift in  both the short run and long run aggregate supply curves 
8,240,    C is correct  The wealth effect explains the impact of increases or decreases in household  wealth on economic activity  Household wealth includes financial and real assets  As  asset values increase consumers save less and spend more out of current income since  they will still be able to meet their wealth accumulation goals  Therefore an increase in  household wealth results in a rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve 
9,240,    B is correct  Higher aggregate demand  AD  and higher aggregate supply  AS  raise real  GDP and lower unemployment meaning employment levels increase 
10,240,    A is correct  Stagflation occurs when output is declining and prices are rising  This is  most likely due to a decline in aggregate supply a leftward shift of the SRAS curve   Depending on the source of the shift the LRAS may shift too 
11,240,    B is correct  An increase in energy prices will shift the short run aggregate supply curve   SRAS  to the left reducing output and increasing prices  If there is no change in the  aggregate demand curve in particular if the central bank does not expand the money  supply slack in the economy will put downward pressure on in input prices shifting the  SRAS back to its original position  In the long run the price level will be unchanged 
12,240,    A is correct  Technology is the most important factor affecting economic growth for  developed countries  Technological advances are very important because they allow an  economy to overcome the limits imposed by diminishing marginal returns

2,241,    B is correct  Labor productivity can be directly measured as output hour 
3,241,    B is correct  Output growth is equal to the growth rate of the labor force plus the growth  rate of labor productivity i e  output per worker  Unlike total factor productivity output  per worker is observable so this is the most practical way to approach estimation of  sustainable growth 
4,241,    B is correct  Total factor productivity  TFP  is a scale factor primarily reflecting  technology  An increase in TFP means that output increases for any level of factor inputs 
5,241,    B is correct  The estimated equation is the standard Solow growth accounting equation   The intercept is the growth rate of total factor productivity 
6,241,    C is correct  In the standard Solow growth accounting equation the coefficient on each  factor s growth rate is its share of income 
7,241,    B is correct  Diminishing marginal productivity of capital means that as a country  accumulates more capital per worker the incremental boost to output declines  Thus all  else the same economies grow more slowly as they become more capital intensive   Given the relative scarcity and hence high marginal productivity of capital in developing  countries they tend to grow more rapidly than developed countries  This leads to  convergence in income levels over time 
8,241,NOTES
9,241, Note that  aggregate expenditure  as defined here does not equal the amount spent by domestic residents on  goods and services because it includes exports  purchases of domestic products by foreigners  and excludes  imports  purchases of foreign products by domestic residents   Thus spending by domestic residents does not  necessarily equal domestic income output  Indeed within any given period it usually does not  This will be  explained in more detail in Section       
10,241, Some textbooks and countries measure flows of income and output by using gross national product  GNP  rather  than GDP  The difference is subtle but can be important in some contexts  GDP includes production within  national borders regardless of whether the factors of production  labor capital and property  are owned  domestically or by foreigners  In contrast GNP measures output produced by domestically owned factors of  production regardless of whether the production occurs domestically or overseas 
11,241,  Final goods  should not be confused with so called final sales and  intermediate goods  should not be confused  with inventories  GDP includes both final sales to customers and increases in companies  inventories  If sales  exceed current production then GDP is less than final sales by the amount of goods sold out of inventory 
12,241, Member states of the European Union are expected to measure and include illegal activities for statistical and  comparative purposes  Guidelines for what activities to include and how to measure them have been established   member states were required to comply with the guidelines effective September

14,241, As shown in Exhibit   Statistics Canada divides the total statistical discrepancy roughly equally  with opposite  signs  between the income  and expenditure based measures of GDP  In the US national accounts the statistical  discrepancy appears only in the income based breakdown of GDP because the expenditures data are believed to be  more accurate than the income data

2,242, Construction of the national income accounts varies across countries  In the United States for example national  income is defined to include income received by US owned factors of production even if the income is generated  outside the United States  To compute US GDP the national income data must be adjusted for net foreign factor  income  No adjustment is required in the Canadian data since the data are measured on a geographic basis  equivalent to GDP

9,242,  An unusual but important special case known as a liquidity trap occurs if a  banks are willing to hold virtually  unlimited excess reserves rather than expand their balance sheets by taking deposits and making loans and or b   demand for money balances by households and companies is insensitive to the level of income  In a liquidity trap  monetary policy will be ineffective and the AD curve will not shift despite the central bank s efforts  Some have  argued that this was a reasonable description of the US situation in      
10,242,  The alert reader may have noted that the stronger yuan will also reduce export demand and shift the AD curve to  the left  The combined impact of the AD and AS shifts on output profit and equity prices is ambiguous

20,243,Agricultural societies experience good harvest times and bad ones  Weather is a main factor that influences crop  production but other factors such as plant and animal diseases also influence the harvest  Modern diversified  economies are less influenced by weather and diseases but as with crops there are fluctuations in economic  output with good times and bad times 
21,243,This reading addresses changes in economic activity and factors that affect it  Some of the factors that influence  short term economic movements such as changes in population technology and capital are the same as  those that affect long term sustainable economic growth  Other factors such as money supply and inflation are  more specific to short term economic fluctuations

3,244,   OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE
4,244,Burns and Mitchell        define the business cycle as follows 
5,244,Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations that  organize their work mainly in business enterprises  a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about  the same time in many economic activities followed by similarly general recessions contractions  and revivals which merge into the expansion phase of the next cycle  this sequence of events is  recurrent but not periodic  in duration business cycles vary from more than one year to    or     years 
6,244,This long definition is rich with important insights  First business cycles are typical of economies that rely  mainly on business enterprises therefore not agrarian societies or centrally planned economies  Second a  cycle has an expected sequence of phases alternating between expansion and contraction  Third such phases  occur at about the same time throughout the economy that is not just in agriculture or not just in tourism but  in almost all sectors  Fourth cycles are recurrent  i e  they happen again and again over time  but not periodic   i e  they do not all have the exact same intensity and or duration   Finally cycles typically last between   and     years 
7,244,Although Burns and Mitchell s definition may appear obvious in part it indeed remains helpful even more than     years after it was written  Although  rules of thumb  are often referred to when talking about market activity   e g  shares always rally in January and big crashes occur in October  reality is much more complex  As Burns  and Mitchell remind us history never repeats itself in quite the same way but it certainly offers patterns that can  be used when analyzing the present and forecasting the future 
8,244,     Phases of the Business Cycle
9,244,A typical business cycle consists of four phases  trough expansion peak contraction  The period of expansion occurs after the trough  lowest point  of a business cycle and before its peak  highest point   The peak and  trough represent turning points in the cycle  Contraction is the period after the peak and before the trough   During the expansion phase aggregate economic activity is increasing  aggregate is used because some  individual economic sectors may not be growing   The contraction often called a recession but may be  called a depression when exceptionally severe is a period in which aggregate economic activity is declining   although some individual sectors may be growing   Business cycles can be thought of as fluctuations around  the trend growth of an economy 
10,244,Exhibit   Panel A shows a stylized representation of the business cycle  Panel B provides a description of some  important characteristics of each phase  The description distinguishes between early and late stages of the  expansion phase  The early stage is closer to the trough and the late stage is closer to the peak  Exhibit   Panel B  also describes how several important economic variables evolve through the course of a business cycle

3,246,Consumer  and  Business  Spending
4,246,Inflation
5,246,Early Expansion   Recovery     Layoffs slow  but new hiring  does not yet  occur and the  unemployment  rate remains  high  Business  turns to  overtime and  temporary  employees to  meet rising  product  demands 
6,246,  Upturn in  spending often  most  pronounced in  housing  durable  consumer  items and  orders for light  producer  equipment 
7,246,  Inflation  remains  moderate and  may continue  to fall 
8,246,Late Expansion   Business  begins full  time rehiring  as overtime  hours rise  The  unemployment  rate falls 
9,246,Peak   Business  slows its rate  of hiring  The  unemployment  rate continues  to fall but at a  decreasing  rate 
10,246,Contraction   Recession    Business first  cuts hours and  freezes hiring  followed by  outright  layoffs  The  unemployment  rate rises 
11,246,  Upturn in  spending  becomes more  broad based   Business  begins to order  heavy  equipment and  engage in  construction 
12,246,  Capital  spending  expands  rapidly but  the growth  rate of  spending starts  to slow down 
13,246,  Inflation picks  up modestly 
14,246,  Inflation  further  accelerates 
15,246,  Decreased  spending most  evident in  industrial  production  housing  consumer  durable items  and orders for  new business  equipment 
16,246,  Inflation  decelerates but  with a lag 
17,246,The behavior of businesses and households frequently incorporates leads and lags relative to what are  established as turning points in a business cycle  For example at the beginning of the expansion phase  companies may want to fully use their existing workforce and wait to hire new employees until they are sure  that the economy is indeed growing  However gradually all economic variables are going to revert toward their  normal range of values  e g  GDP growth will be a positive number   As the economy returns to normal any  countercyclical economic policies adopted by a central bank  the monetary authority in most modern  economies  are gradually phased out  For example if the central bank reduced interest rates to stimulate the  economy during a recession it may start increasing rates toward their historical norms 
18,246,During a recession investors place relatively high values on such safer assets as government securities and  shares of companies with steady  or growing  positive cash flows such as utilities and producers of staple  goods  Such preferences reflect the fact that the marginal utility of a safe income stream increases in periods  when employment is insecure or declining  When asset markets expect the end of a recession and the beginning  of an expansion phase risky assets will be repriced upward  When an expansion is expected the markets will  start incorporating higher profit expectations into the prices of corporate bonds and stocks particularly those of  such cyclical companies as producers of discretionary goods for example automobiles  Typically equity  markets will hit a trough about three to six months before the economy bottoms and well before the economic  indicators turn up  Indeed the equity stock market is classified as a leading indicator of the economy

2,247,When an economy s expansion is well established a later part of an expansion called a boom often follows   The boom is an expansionary phase which is characterized by economic growth  testing the limits  of the  economy  For example companies may expand so much that they have difficulty finding qualified workers and  will compete with other prospective employers by raising wages  The resulting rise in labor costs may lead to a  reduction of profits  Another example is that companies may begin to believe that the economy will continue  expanding for the foreseeable future and decide to borrow money to expand their production capacity  The  government and or central bank may step in if it is concerned about the economy overheating  Consider the  following situation  The central bank is concerned that excessive salary growth may lead to inflation  For  example companies will try to pass on higher production costs to their customers or excessive borrowing may  cause investors to have cash flow problems  At the height of the boom phase the economy is said to be  overheating  just like the engine of a car that has been pushed to an excessive level  
3,247,During the boom the riskiest assets will often have substantial price increases  Safe assets such as government  bonds that were more highly prized during the recession may have lower prices and thus higher yields  In  addition investors may fear higher inflation which also contributes to higher nominal yields 
4,247,The end of the expansion or boom is characterized by the peak of the business cycle which is also the  beginning of the contraction  also known as downturn   Here either because of restrictive economic policies  established to tame an overheated economy or because of some other shock such as energy prices or a credit  crisis the economy stumbles and starts slowing down  Unemployment increases and GDP growth decreases  during this part of the business cycle 
5,247,EXAMPLE  
6,247,When Do Recessions Begin and End 
7,247,A simple and commonly referred to rule is  A recession has started when a country or region experiences  two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth  Real GDP growth is a measure of the  real  or   inflation adjusted  growth of the overall economy  This rule can be misleading because it does not  indicate a recession if real GDP growth is negative in one quarter slightly positive the next quarter and  again negative in the next quarter  Many analysts question this result  This issue is why in some  countries there are statistical and economic committees that apply the principles stated by Burns and  Mitchell to several macroeconomic variables  and not just real GDP growth  as a basis to identify  business cycle peaks and troughs  The National Bureau of Economic Research  NBER  is the well  known organization that dates business cycles in the United States  Interestingly the economists and  statisticians on NBER s Business Cycle Dating Committee analyze numerous time series of data  focusing on employment industrial production and sales  Because the data are available with a delay   preliminary data releases can be revised even one year after the period they refer to  it also means that  the Committee s determinations may take place well after the business cycle turning points have  occurred  As we will see later in the reading there are practical indicators that may help economists  understand in advance if a cyclical turning point is about to happen 
8,247,   Which of the following rules is most likely to be used to determine whether the economy is in a  recession 
9,247,A  The central bank has run out of foreign reserves 
10,247,B  Real GDP has two consecutive quarters of negative growth 
11,247,C  Economic activity experiences a significant decline in two business sectors 
12,247,   Suppose you are interested in forecasting earnings growth for a company active in a country where  no official business cycle dating committee  such as the NBER  exists  The variables you are most  likely to consider to identify peaks and troughs of a country s business cycle are 
13,247,A  inflation interest rates and unemployment 
14,247,B  stock market values and money supply 
15,247,C  unemployment GDP growth industrial production and inflation

2,248,Solution to   
3,248,B is correct  GDP is a measure of economic activity for the whole economy  Changes in foreign reserves  or a limited number of sectors may not have a material impact on the whole economy 
4,248,Solution to   
5,248,C is correct  Unemployment GDP growth industrial production and inflation are measures of economic  activity  The discount rate the monetary base and stock market indexes are not direct measures of  economic activities  The first two are determined by monetary policy which react to economic activities  whereas the stock market indexes tend to be forward looking or leading indicators of the economy 
6,248,Investors who are often optimists in the expansion phase tend to be overly pessimistic at the bottom of the  business cycle  It is worth noting that in many business cycles the duration of economic contractions have been  shorter than the duration of expansions 
7,248,Many economic variables and sectors of the economy have distinctive cyclical patterns  Knowledge of these  patterns can offer insight into likely cyclical directions overall or can be particularly applicable to an investment  strategy that requires more specific rather than general cyclical insights for investment success  The following  sections provide overviews of how the use of resources  the factors of production  typically evolves through the  business cycle and how the sectors of real estate and external trade characteristically behave 
8,248,     Resource Use through the Business Cycle
9,248,This section provides a broad overview of how the use of resources needed to produce goods and services  typically evolves during a business cycle 
10,248,There are significant links between fluctuations in inventory employment and investment in physical capital  with economic fluctuations  When a downturn starts aggregate demand decreases and as a result inventories  may start to accumulate  Companies may slow production and have equipment that is being used at less than full  capacity  Subsequently companies are likely to stop ordering new inventories and new production equipment 
11,248,Companies do not necessarily reduce their workforces immediately  instead they reduce costs by other means  such as eliminating overtime  If it is just a temporary economic slowdown retaining workers that are not being  fully utilized may be a better alternative than firing workers and replacing them later  Finding and training new  workers is costly and it may be more cost efficient to keep workers on the payroll even if they are not fully  utilized while waiting out a short period of slow business  Second some economists suggest that there is an  implicit bond of loyalty between a company and its workers and thus workers will be more productive if they  know that the company is not disposing of them at the first sign of economic trouble 
12,248,If the downturn becomes more severe companies will start reducing costs more aggressively cutting all non  essential costs  This step often means terminating consultants workers beyond the strict minimum standing  supply orders advertising campaigns and so on  Capacity utilization will be low and few companies will invest  in new equipment and structures  Companies will try to liquidate their inventories of unsold products  In  addition banks will be reluctant to lend because bankruptcy risks are perceived to be higher  As a result the  economy enters what seems to be a downward spiral 
13,248,The gap between the recession output  GDPR  and the potential output  GDPP  the level of real GDP that could  be achieved if all resources were fully utilized is an indicator of slack resources  unemployment for labor and  idleness for physical capital   Decreases in aggregate demand are likely to depress wages or wage growth as  well as prices of inputs and capital goods  After a while all of these input prices will be relatively very low  In  addition the monetary authority may cut interest rates to try to revive the economy 
14,248,As the prices and interest rates decrease consumers and companies may begin to purchase more and aggregate  demand may begin to rise  Companies may increase production as a result of increased demand and low levels  of inventory of finished products  Also because interest rates have fallen some companies and households may  decide to start investing in structures housing and durable goods  equipment for companies appliances for  households   This stage is the turning point of the business cycle  aggregate demand starts to increase and  economic activity increases

2,249,When economic activity increases companies are unlikely to immediately start the costly process of selecting  and hiring new workers  They may wait for the expansion to give clear signs of life  However if enough new  investment triggers an increase in aggregate demand companies will start replenishing their inventories of  finished products  This replenishment will increase the demand for intermediate products which will further  increase aggregate demand  This stage is often called inventory rebuilding or restocking in the financial press  and may be followed by additional increases in capital expenditures  Demand for all factors of  production land labor materials and physical capital increases 
3,249,As aggregate demand continues to grow a boom phase of the cycle begins  In a boom phase the economy may  experience shortages and the demand for factors of production may exceed supply  It is possible that the excess  demand is triggered by overly optimistic expectations of demand for products which means that the supply of  physical capital and production capacity may exceed the demand for products in the future  Past examples of  excessive supply attributable to overinvestment include fiber optic infrastructure during the     s technology  boom and residential overbuilding in many countries during the     s housing bubble  This overinvestment  which results in unused productive capacity are possible triggers for the next recession 
4,249,       Fluctuation in Capital Spending
5,249,This section describes how capital spending spending on tangible goods such as property plant and  equipment typically fluctuates with the business cycle  Because business profits and cash flows are sensitive to  changes in economic activity capital spending is also sensitive to changes in economic activity  Shifts in capital  spending tend to affect the overall economic cycle in three stages or phases 
6,249,In the early stage of a contraction the downturn in spending on equipment usually occurs abruptly as demand  for companies  products starts to decrease  Businesses seeing a decline in sales and expecting a drop in profits  and free cash flow will halt new ordering and may even cancel existing orders because there is no perceived  need to expand production capacity  The initial cuts typically occur in orders for technology and light equipment  because there are shorter lead times from order to delivery and managers may simply not place any additional  orders  It often takes longer to cancel or halt construction activity or the installation of larger more complex  pieces of equipment and cutbacks in these areas unfold with a longer lag  Typically the initial cutbacks at this  stage exaggerate the economy s contraction  Then later as the general cyclical downturn matures cutbacks in  spending on structures and heavy equipment further intensify the contraction 
7,249,In the early stages of an expansion when the economy begins its recovery sales are still at such low levels that  a business is likely to have excess productive capacity and has little need to expand it  But although capacity  utilization remains low capital spending may begin to increase  There are two primary reasons underlying the  increase in capital spending  One growth in earnings and free cash flow attributable to the economic  improvement gives businesses the financial ability to increase spending  Two the upturn in sales may convince  managers to reinstate some orders that had been canceled  Typically the orders initially reinstated are for  equipment with a high rate of obsolescence such as software systems and technological hardware  This type of  equipment is likely to enhance efficiency more than expand capacity  enhancing efficiency may be the initial  focus of new orders  An increase in new orders for equipment to enhance efficiency often provides the first  signal of recovery  Because orders precede actual shipments and possibly payments an emphasized and widely  watched indicator of the future direction of capital spending is orders for capital equipment 
8,249,In the later stage of expansion productive capacity may begin to limit ability to respond to demand  Orders and  sales at this stage focus on capacity expansion and increasingly are for heavy and complex equipment  warehouses and factories  Spending on new capacity may begin before capacity seems to need additions  This  seeming disconnect occurs because there can be a long lag between order and delivery or completion of heavy  and complex equipment warehouses factories and so on  Also because economies are always changing their  needs physical capital that counts as capacity in the statistics may be less relevant to current production needs  even though the underlying assets remain fully serviceable  The composition of the economy s capacity may not  be optimal for the current economic structure necessitating spending for new capital  A company for instance  that needs more transportation equipment cannot substitute with a surplus of forklifts although they are counted  in overall capacity  Similarly a company that needs warehouse space in the suburbs of Mumbai benefits little  from its surplus warehouse space in Goa  The increase in capital spending to increase capacity may occur  surprisingly soon after capacity utilization picks up  New orders intended to increase capacity may be an early  indicator of the late stage of the expansion phase

2,250,Capital Spending
3,250,   The most likely reason that US analysts often follow new orders for capital goods excluding  defense and aircraft is because 
4,250,A  the military is part of the public sector 
5,250,B  aircraft and defense equipment orders are often the same so there is double counting 
6,250,C  armed forces and airlines tend to place infrequent and large orders which create a false  signal for the index 
7,250,   Orders for equipment decline before construction orders in a recession because 
8,250,A  businesses are uncertain about cyclical directions 
9,250,B  they are easier to cancel than large construction contracts 
10,250,C  business values light equipment less than structures and heavy machinery 
11,250,Solution to   
12,250,C is correct  Business cycle indicators need to represent the activities in the whole economy and thus  should not be influenced by some particular sectors that may have uncorrelated fluctuations 
13,250,Solution to   
14,250,B is correct  Because it usually takes much longer time to plan and complete large construction projects  than for equipment orders construction projects may be less influenced by business cycles 
15,250,Note  New orders statistics include orders that will be delivered over several years  For example it is common for airlines to  order    airplanes to be delivered over five years  Therefore analysts use  core  orders that exclude defense and aircrafts for  a better understanding of the economy s trend 
16,250,       Fluctuation in Inventory Levels
17,250,Inventory accumulation and cutbacks by businesses can occur with such speed and frequency that they have a  much greater effect on economic growth than justified by their relatively small aggregate size relative to the  economy as a whole  A key indicator in this area is the inventory sales ratio that measures the inventories  available for sale to the level of sales  The interaction of this gauge with the cycle develops in three distinct  stages 
18,250,Toward the peak of the economic cycle as sales fall or slow businesses may lag in cutting back on new  production and inventories increase  The lower sales combined with higher inventories result in an increase in  inventory sales ratios  This apparent increase in inventories may hide signs of a weakening economy   Practitioners  investment analysts and others  look for measures that focus on what are commonly called  final  sales  which exclude the effects of inventory changes  To adjust and sell off these unwanted inventories a  business may cut production below even the reduced sales levels  This cut in production causes subsequent  indicators in the overall economy to look weaker than they otherwise might have been  Although final sales  offer a reality check the production cutbacks involved in reducing inventory levels may lead to order  cancellations and layoffs by producers that may subsequently cut final sales further and deepen cyclical  corrections

2,251,With businesses producing at rates below the sales volumes necessary to dispose of unwanted inventories  inventory sales ratios begin to fall back toward normal  When these indicators return to acceptable levels and  businesses no longer have any need to further reduce inventories they will raise production levels  The increase  in production results in a seemingly improved economic situation even if sales remain depressed  Again final  sales may provide a more realistic picture of the underlying economic situation  At this phase in the cycle the  seemingly minor increase in production levels can actually mark the beginning of the cyclical turn because  layoffs may slow or stop and demand for other inputs may also increase 
3,251,As sales begin their cyclical upturn a business may initially fail to keep production on pace with sales which  causes it to lose inventory to the initial sales increase  The subsequent fall in inventory sales ratios when it  occurs in the face of rising sales quickly prompts a surge in production not only to catch up with sales but also  to replenish depleted inventories  However sometimes during short or severe recessions when businesses have  not had time to adjust or reduce inventories to acceptable levels companies may initially consider increased  production unnecessary  As a result the lag between increased sales and production may be longer than in other  cycles  But whether the production upturn occurs with a short or a long lag it typically marks a turn in hiring  patterns and for a time can markedly exaggerate the cyclical strength 
4,251,EXAMPLE  
5,251,Inventory Fluctuation
6,251,   Although a small part of the overall economy changes in inventories can influence economic  growth measures significantly because they 
7,251,A  reflect general business sentiment 
8,251,B  tend to move forcefully up or down 
9,251,C  determine the availability of goods for sale 
10,251,   Inventories tend to rise when 
11,251,A  inventory sales ratios are low 
12,251,B  inventory sales ratios are high 
13,251,C  economic activity begins to rebound 
14,251,   Inventories will often fall early in a recovery because 
15,251,A  businesses need profit 
16,251,B  sales outstrip production 
17,251,C  businesses ramp up production because of increased economic activity 
18,251,Solution to   
19,251,B is correct  As stated in the reading inventory level fluctuates dramatically over the business cycle 
20,251,Solution to   
21,251,A is correct  When the economy starts to recover sales of inventories can outpace production which  results in low inventory sales ratios  Companies then need to accumulate more inventories to restore the  ratio to normal level  C is incorrect because in the early stages of a recovery inventories are likely to  fall as sales increase faster than production

2,252,Solution to   
3,252,B is correct  The companies are slow to increase production in early recovery phase because they first  want to confirm the recession is over  Increasing output also takes time after the downsizing during the  recession 
4,252,       Consumer Behavior
5,252,Households represent the largest single sector of almost every developed economy  for example it is     of the  US economy   As a result patterns of household consumption determine overall economic direction more than  any other sector  Patterns of household consumption are important to practitioners for a variety of reasons  For  example equity analysts covering consumer product companies would have a high interest in the sector 
6,252,Two primary measures of household consumption are retail sales and a broad based indicator of consumer  spending that also includes purchases outside purely retail establishments such as utilities household services  and so on  Often these measures are presented in nominal terms and deflated to indicate directions of real or unit  purchases and growth  Some additional measures make finer distinctions such as tracking spending both real  and nominal of a specific group s  of consumer products  The three major divisions are     durable goods such  as autos appliances and furniture      non durable goods such as food medicine cosmetics and clothing  and      services such as medical treatment entertainment communications and personal services  Because durable  purchases usually replace items with longer useful lives during economic downturns households can postpone  such purchases more readily than spending on either services or non durable goods  Comparing trends in  durable purchases with those in the other categories can give practitioners a notion of the economy s progress  through the cycle  a weakness in durables spending may be an early indication of general economic weakness  and an increase in such spending may signal a more general cyclical recovery 
7,252,Beyond direct observations of consumer spending and its mix practitioners can also gauge future directions by  analyzing measures of consumer confidence or sentiment to ascertain how aggressive consumers may be in their  spending  Usually such information is in the form of surveys intended to provide practitioners with a general  guide to trends  But in practice they frequently do not reflect actual consumer behavior because survey  respondents may answer what they imagine are the preferences of the typical consumer indicating behavior  contrary to their own 
8,252,Growth in income is typically a better indicator of consumption prospects and household income figures are  widely available in most countries  Especially relevant is after tax income or what is frequently called  disposable income  Some analysts chart consumer spending based on a concept termed permanent income   Permanent income excludes temporary income and unsustainable losses and gains and tries to capture the  income flow on which households believe they can rely  The basic level of consumption reflects this notion of  permanent income  However spending on durables tends to rise and fall with disposable income regardless of  the source not just permanent income 
9,252,But consumer spending patterns frequently diverge from trends in income no matter how income is measured   An analysis of the saving rates can assist practitioners in this regard  Cross border comparisons of saving rates  are difficult because saving rates are calculated in different ways in different countries and sometimes in  different ways within the same country  But because all measures of saving rates aim in one way or another to  measure the percentage of income households set aside from spending changes in saving rates can capture  consumers  intent to reduce spending out of current income  The saving rate may also reflect future income  uncertainties perceived by consumers  precautionary savings   Therefore a higher saving rate may indicate  consumers  ability to spend despite possible lower income in the future  A rise in the saving rate usually  measured as a percentage of income may indicate caution among households and signal economic weakening   At the same time the greater the stock of savings in the household sector and the wider the gap between  ongoing income and spending the greater the capacity for households to increase their spending  So although  unusually high savings may at first say something negative about the cyclical outlook they point longer term to  the potential for recovery

2,253,Consumer Behavior
3,253,   Durable goods have the most pronounced cyclical behavior because 
4,253,A  they have a longer useful life 
5,253,B  their purchase cannot be delayed 
6,253,C  they are needed more than non durable goods or services 
7,253,   Permanent income provides a better guide to 
8,253,A  saving rates 
9,253,B  spending on services 
10,253,C  spending on durable goods 
11,253,Solution to   
12,253,A is correct  Durable goods are usually big ticket items the life span of which can be extended with  repairs and without incurring the high replacement costs  So consumers tend to delay replacement when  economic outlook is not favorable 
13,253,Solution to   
14,253,B is correct  Households adjust consumption of discretionary goods and services based on the perceived  permanent income level rather than temporary earning fluctuations  Saving rates and durable goods  consumption are more related to the short term uncertainties caused by recessions 
15,253,     Housing Sector Behavior
16,253,Although generally a much smaller part of the overall economy than consumer spending housing activity  experiences dramatic swings that it often counts more in overall economic movements than the sector s  relatively small size might suggest  Almost every major economy offers statistics on new and existing home  sales residential construction activity and sometimes importantly the inventory of unsold homes on the  market  Statistics are also potentially available for the average or median price of homes sometimes recorded by  type of housing unit and sometimes as the price per square foot or square meter  Whatever the specific statistics  the relationships in this area typically follow fairly regular cyclical patterns 
17,253,Because many home buyers finance their purchase with a mortgage the sector is especially sensitive to interest  rates  Home buying and consequently construction activity expand in response to lower mortgage rates and  contract in response to higher mortgage rates 
18,253,Beyond such interest rate effects housing also follows its own internal cycle  When housing prices are low  relative to average incomes and especially when mortgage rates are also low the cost of owning a house falls  and demand for housing increases  Often indicators of the cost of owning a house are available to compare  household incomes with the cost of supporting an average house both its price and the expense of a typical  mortgage  Commonly housing prices and mortgage rates rise disproportionately as expansionary cycles mature  bringing on an increase in relative housing costs even as household incomes rise  The resulting slowdown of  house sales can lead to a cyclical downturn first in buying and then as the inventory of unsold houses builds in  actual construction activity

2,254,These links clear as they are are far from mechanical  If housing prices have risen rapidly in the recent past for  instance many people will buy to gain exposure to the expected price gains even as the purchase in other  respects becomes harder to rationalize  Such behavior can extend the cycle upward and may result in a more  severe correction  This result occurs because  late buying  activity invites overbuilding  The large inventory of  unsold homes eventually puts downward pressure on real estate prices catching late buyers who have stretched  their resources  This pattern occurred in many countries during the           global financial crisis 
3,254,Behind such cyclical considerations housing more than most economic sectors responds to demographics in  particular the pace of family or household formation in an economy  Not every economy has data on family  formation but almost all offer information on the growth of particular age groups or cohorts in their respective  populations  A focus on those cohorts typically     to    year olds when household formation commonly  occurs usually can substitute for direct measures of net family formation  Adjusted for older people who are  vacating existing homes such calculations serve as an indicator of underlying longer term secular housing  demand  Although such measures have little to do with business cycles they do offer a gauge along with  affordability of how quickly the housing market can correct excess and return to growth  In China for instance  where the government estimated a need for about     million more urban housing units over the following     years housing demand may quickly reverse cyclical weakness more so than in such economies as Italy or Japan  where net new family formation is relatively slight 
4,254,EXAMPLE  
5,254,Housing Sector Behavior
6,254,   Housing is more sensitive than other sectors of the economy to 
7,254,A  interest rates 
8,254,B  permanent income 
9,254,C  government spending 
10,254,   Apart from questions of affordability house buying is most likely affected by 
11,254,A  the rate of family formation 
12,254,B  expectation of housing price increases 
13,254,C  both the rate of family formation and expectation of housing price increases 
14,254,Solution to   
15,254,A is correct  Because real estate purchases are usually financed with mortgage loans interest rate  changes directly influence the monthly payment amounts 
16,254,Solution to   
17,254,C is correct  Family formation constitutes the actual need for housing whereas buying on the expectation  of housing price increases reflects the fact that real estate has investment value 
18,254,     External Trade Sector Behavior
19,254,The external trade sector varies tremendously in size and importance from one economy to another  In such  places as Singapore where almost all inputs are imported and the bulk of the economy s output finds its way to  the export market trade  the sum of both exports and imports  easily exceeds its GDP  In other places such as  the United States external trade assumes a much smaller part of GDP  Since the     s the relative size of  external trade has grown in almost every country in the world  With the rise in external trade the business  cycles of the large economies in the world can be more easily transmitted to other economies

2,255,Typically imports rise all else equal with the pace of domestic GDP growth as needs and wants or generally  rising demand also increase purchases of goods and services from abroad  Thus imports respond to the domestic  cycle  Exports are more dependent on cycles in the rest of the world  If these external cycles are strong all else  equal exports will grow even if the domestic economy should experience a decline in growth  To understand the  impact of exports financial analysts need to understand the strength of the major trading partners of the  economy under consideration  Most practitioners look at the net difference between exports and imports  they  use the balance of payments which calculates trade s contribution to the economy as exports less imports   The  net effect of trade may offset cyclical weakness and depending on the importance of exports to the economy  could erase it altogether  For these reasons such differences can mean the pattern of external trade balances is  entirely different from the rest of the domestic economic cycle 
3,255,Currency also has an independent effect that can move trade in directions strikingly different from the domestic  economic cycle  When a nation s currency appreciates  the currency gains in strength relative to other  currencies  foreign goods seem cheaper than domestic goods to the domestic population prompting all else  equal a relative rise in imports  At the same time such currency appreciation makes that nation s exports more  expensive in global markets and may reduce exports  Of course currency depreciation has the opposite effect   Although currency moves may be volatile and on occasion extreme they only have a significant effect on trade  and the balance of payments when they cumulate in a single direction for some time  Moves from one month or  quarter to the next however great have a minimal effect until they persist  Thus cumulative currency  movements that take place over a period of years will have an impact on trade flows that will persist even if the  currency subsequently moves in the opposite direction for a temporary period 
4,255,Financial analysts need to consider a wide range of variables both in the domestic economy and abroad to  assess relative GDP growth rates and then factor in currency considerations to ascertain whether they reinforce  other cyclical forces or counteract them  Generally GDP growth differentials in global economic growth rates  between countries have the most immediate and straightforward effects  domestic changes in economic activity  raise or reduce imports and foreign economic activity changes raise or reduce exports  Currency moves have a  more complex and despite the interim short term currency moves a more gradual effect

2,256,   THEORIES OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE
3,256,Business cycles have been recognized since the early days of economic theory and considerable effort has gone  into identifying different cycles and explaining them  Until the     s however the general view was that they  were a natural feature of the economy and the pain of recessions is temporary  But the depth and severity of the      s downturn  known as the Great Depression  created a crisis in economic theory 
4,256,After the Great Depression  which began in       the debate between various economic schools of thought   Neoclassical Austrian and Keynesian  spurred changes in the way the business cycle was described and  explained  Similarly after the recessions triggered by the oil shocks of      and      the old paradigm was  taken apart and new developments in economics and quantitative methods led to an improved understanding of  short term economic dynamics  In this section we will review and summarize some of the main theories 
5,256,     Neoclassical and Austrian Schools
6,256,Neoclassical analysis relies on the concept of general equilibrium that is all markets will reach equilibrium  because of the  invisible hand or free market  and the price will be found for every good at which supply  equals demand  All resources are used efficiently based on the principle of marginal cost equaling marginal  revenue and no involuntary unemployment of labor or capital takes place  In theory if a shock of any origin  shifts either the aggregate demand or aggregate supply curve the economy will quickly readjust and reach its  equilibrium via lower interest rates and lower wages  In practice because the neoclassical school provides that  the invisible hand will reallocate capital and labor so that they will be used to produce whatever consumers  want it does not allow for  fluctuations found in the aggregate economic activity  
7,256,Neoclassical economists rely on Say s law  All that is produced will be sold because supply creates its own  demand  French economist J B  Say pointed out that if something is produced the capital and labor used for that  production will have to be compensated  This compensation of the factors  interest for capital and wages for  labor  creates purchasing power in the sense that the workers receive a paycheck and thus can buy goods and  services they need  Widespread declines in demand would be strictly temporary 
8,256,The Neoclassical school does not have a theory of the business cycle and the closest it gets to it is Schumpeter s  creative destruction theory which shows cycles within industries as a result of technological progress but no  economy wide fluctuations   Schumpeter formulated a theory of innovations which explained cycles limited to  individual industries  When an inventor comes up with a new product  e g  the digital music player in recent  decades  or a new better way to produce an existing good or service  e g  radio frequency identification  tracking of inventories  then the entrepreneur that introduces the new discovery will likely have bigger profits  and may drive the existing producers out of business  Therefore innovations can generate crises that affect only  the industry affected by the new invention  Neoclassical economics recognizes that business cycles exist but  treats them as temporary disequilibria 
9,256,In the neoclassical school a massive crisis such as the Great Depression of the     s with widespread  unemployment of more than     throughout the industrialized world is impossible  Yet it happened  The crisis  started in the United States and successively affected many other countries  The      crisis touched many  sectors at the same time and in a dramatic fashion  Because the neoclassical theory denied the possibility of a  prolonged depression it could not be used to explain how to fight such a depression  The main adjustment  mechanism proposed by the neoclassical school cuts in wages was difficult to achieve and as we shall see  was questioned by the Keynesian school 
10,256,The Austrian school including F  von Hayek and L  von Mises shared some views of the neoclassical school  but focused more on two topics that were largely unimportant in the neoclassical framework  the roles of money  and government  Money was not necessary in the neoclassical model because the exchange of goods and  services could occur in the form of barter and still reach general equilibrium  Money was seen just as a way to  simplify exchange  Similarly the role of government in the neoclassical model was quite limited because the  economy could take care of itself and little else was needed of the government besides upholding the law and  securing the borders

2,257,The Austrian school has a theory of what causes the business cycle  It is misguided government intervention   Von Hayek argued that fluctuations are caused by governments that try to increase GDP and employment  thus  perhaps increasing voters  consensus  by adopting expansionary monetary policies  Governments lower the  market interest rate below its natural value  aggregate demand shifts right  and thus lead companies to  overinvest  an inflationary gap   Once companies realize that they have accumulated too much equipment and  too many structures they will suddenly stop investing which depresses aggregate demand  aggregate demand  shifts left dramatically  and causes a crisis throughout the economy  To reach the new equilibrium all prices  including wages must decrease 
3,257,As a result of manipulating interest rates the economy exhibits fluctuations that would not have happened  otherwise  Therefore Austrian economists advocate limited government intervention in the economy lest the  government causes a boom and bust cycle  The best thing to do in the recession phase is to allow the necessary  market adjustment to take place as quickly as possible 
4,257,     Keynesian and Monetarist Schools
5,257,The Keynesian and Monetarist schools of economic thought have been among the most influential  Their  prescriptions concerning the business cycle are discussed in the following sections 
6,257,       Keynesian School
7,257,As previously mentioned if a recession occurs the Neoclassical and Austrian schools argue in general that no  government intervention is needed  Unemployment and excess supply of goods will be solved by allowing  market prices to decrease  including wages  until all markets clear  Supply equals demand and factors of  production are fully employed 
8,257,British economist John Maynard Keynes  disagreed with both Neoclassical and Austrian views  He observed  that a generalized price and wage reduction  solely brought about through market forces  necessary to bring  markets back to equilibrium during a recession would be hard to attain  For example workers may not want to  see their nominal compensation decrease because nobody likes a pay cut 
9,257,But Keynes thought that even if workers agreed to accept lower salaries this situation might exacerbate the  crisis by reducing aggregate demand rather than solving it because lower wage expectations would shift  aggregate demand left  For example if wages fell workers would need to cut back on their spending  This  response would cause a further contraction in the demand for all sorts of goods and services starting from the  more expensive items such as durable goods and move in a  domino effect  through the economy  the  downward spiral of the aggregate demand curve continuously shifting left as mentioned earlier  
10,257,Furthermore Keynes believed there could be circumstances in which lower interest rates would not reignite  growth because business confidence or  animal spirit  was too low  As a consequence Keynes advocated  government intervention in the form of fiscal policy  While he accepted the possibility that markets would reach  the equilibrium envisioned by Neoclassical and Austrian economists over the long run he famously quipped that   in the long run we are all dead   that is the human suffering is excessive while waiting for all shocks to be  absorbed and for the economy to return to equilibrium 
11,257,When crises occur the government should intervene to keep capital and labor employed by deliberately running  a larger fiscal deficit  This intervention would limit the damages of major recessions  Although this concept  continues to be a highly politically charged debate many economists agree that government expenditure can  limit the negative effect of major economic crises in the short term  The practical criticisms that are often  expressed about Keynesian fiscal policy are 
12,257,   Fiscal deficits mean higher government debt that needs to be serviced and repaid eventually  There is a  danger that government finances could move out of control 
13,257,   Keynesian cyclical policies are focused on the short term  In the long run the economy may come back  and the presence of the expansionary policy may cause it to  overheat  that is to have unsustainably  fast economic growth which causes inflation and other problems  This result is because of the typical lags  involved in expansionary policy taking effect on the economy

2,258,   Fiscal policy takes time to implement  Quite often by the time stimulatory fiscal policy kicks in the  economy is already recovering   Monetary policy determines the available quantities of money and loans  in an economy  
3,258,Keynes  writings did not advocate a continuous presence of the government in the economy nor did he suggest  using economic policy to  fine tune  the business cycle  He only advocated decisive action in case of a serious  economic crisis such as the Great Depression 
4,258,The Perspective of Hyman Minsky
5,258,A different view of business cycles came from Hyman Minsky  His view had something in common with  the Austrian school and something in common with Keynes  Minsky believed that excesses in financial  markets exacerbate economic fluctuations  For example a rapid growth of credit often given to risky  ventures in the late expansion phase of the cycle will be followed by a  credit crunch  during the down  swing phase  Minsky traced excesses to a type of complacency in which people underestimate the risk of  events that have not occurred in a while  Therefore if the economy has been in a long expansion people  may think that the market works very well and that the expansion will last forever that is extrapolating  past experiences  In this sense Minsky could be seen as a precursor of behavioral finance which is the  branch of finance that studies how cognition biases such as overconfidence and short memory induce  investors to be overconfident and make suboptimal choices 
6,258,The term Minsky moment has been coined for a point in business cycle when after individuals become  overextended in borrowing to finance speculative investments people start realizing that something is  likely to go wrong and a panic ensues leading to asset sell offs  The subprime crisis that affected many  industrialized countries starting in      has been represented as a  Minsky moment   because it came  after years in which risk premiums  e g  the differentials or spreads between very risky bonds and very  safe bonds  were at historically low levels  Typically low risk premiums suggest that no adverse events  are expected in other words investors believe that because the economy and the markets have been  enjoying a protracted expansion there is no reason to worry about the future  As a consequence many  market observers suggest that business cycles are being tamed  This kind of view of the world leads  people to underestimate risk for example by not doing the appropriate diligent research before granting  a loan or before purchasing a security in a word complacency 
7,258,The  Minsky moment  has been compared with a cartoon in which a cartoon character walks over a cliff  without realizing that it is doing so  When he looks down and sees that he is walking on thin air he  panics and falls to the bottom of the canyon just like the world economy in      
8,258,A warning in      by Alan Greenspan then chairman of the US Federal Reserve  was not taken  seriously by market participants  Greenspan said that historically extended periods of low risk premiums  always ended badly  This warning was to a large extent in line with Minsky s view  People tend to  extrapolate the recent past and if little volatility has occurred recently they may think that low volatility  will persist indefinitely 
9,258,Some market analysts after the crisis pointed out that not even Greenspan knew how accurate his  remark would turn out to be  As explained by Reinhart and Rogoff        and Siegel        when  rates were very low investors tried to get extra yield by investing in complex and potentially more risky  assets such as securitized subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations whose credit  worthiness was much lower than expected 
10,258,As soon as the economy started having difficulties the value of many risky securities dropped  dramatically placing investors globally into a state of panic and causing a dramatic fall in aggregate  demand  The crisis is another example of why thinking that a new era has started and the things learned  from analyzing the past no longer apply is generally a very costly mistake 
11,258,       Monetarist School

2,259,The Monetarist school generally identified with Milton Friedman objected to Keynesian intervention for four  main reasons 
3,259,   The Keynesian model does not recognize the supreme importance of the money supply  If the money  supply grows too fast there will be an unsustainable boom and if it grows too slowly there will be a  recession  Friedman focused mainly on broad measures of money such as M  
4,259,   The Keynesian model lacks a complete representation of utility maximizing agents and is thus not  logically sound 
5,259,   Keynes  short term view failed to consider the long term costs of government intervention  e g  growing  government debt and high cost of interest on this debt  
6,259,   The timing of governments  economic policy responses was uncertain and the stimulative effects of a  fiscal expansion may take effect after the crisis was over and thus cause more harm than good  
7,259,Therefore Monetarists advocate a focus on maintaining steady growth of the money supply and otherwise a  very limited role for government in the economy  Fiscal and monetary policy should be clear and consistent over  time so all economic agents can forecast government actions  In this way the uncertainty of economic  fluctuations would not be increased by any uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of economic policies and  their lagged effects 
8,259,According to the Monetarist school business cycles may occur both because of exogenous shocks and because  of government intervention  It is better to let aggregate demand and supply find their own equilibrium than to  risk causing further economic fluctuations  However a key part of monetarist thought is that the money supply  needs to continue to grow at a moderate rate  If it falls as occurred in the     s the economic downturn could  be severe whereas if money grows too fast inflation will follow 
9,259,     The New Classical School
10,259,Starting in the     s economists such as Robert Lucas started questioning the foundations of the models used to  explain business cycles  Among other things Lucas agreed with Friedman        and pointed out that the  macroeconomic models should try to represent the actions of economic agents with a utility function and a  budget constraint just like the models used in microeconomics  This approach has come to be known as new  classical macroeconomics an approach to macroeconomics that seeks the macroeconomic conclusions of  individuals maximizing utility on the basis of rational expectations and companies maximizing profits  The  assumption is made that all agents are roughly alike and thus solving the problem of one agent is the same as  solving that of millions of similar agents  or the per capita income and consumption of the average agent  
11,259,The New Classical models are dynamic in the sense of describing fluctuations over many periods and present  general equilibrium in the sense of determining all prices rather than one price  The models by Edward C   Prescott and Finn E  Kydland who are among the pioneers of this approach have an economic agent that has to  face external shocks  e g  as a result of changes in technology tastes or world prices  and thus optimizes its  choices to reach the highest utility  If all agents act in similar fashion the markets will gradually adjust toward  equilibrium 
12,259,       Models without Money  Real Business Cycle Theory
13,259,New Classical economists comment that some policy recommendations made in the past were rather illogical   for example if everybody knows that in a recession the government will give out low rate loans to corporations  that want to invest in new equipment and structures why would any reasonable company invest outside  recessions unless absolutely required to  Obviously if most companies thought that they would stop investing  thus causing a recession that otherwise would not have occurred  Essentially the government s anti cyclical  policy could cause a recession 
14,259,Because just like the neoclassical models the initial New Classical models did not include money they were  called real business cycle models  often abbreviated as RBC   Cycles have real causes such as the  aforementioned changes in technology whereas monetary variables such as inflation are assumed to have no  effect on GDP and unemployment  
15,259,http   e pub    dmfvhginc mna  y  vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print

2,260,RBC models of the business cycle conclude that expansions and contractions represent efficient operation of the  economy in response to external real shocks  Because the level of economic activity at any time is consistent  with maximizing expected utility the policy recommendation of RBC theory is for government not to intervene  in the economy with discretionary fiscal and monetary policy 
3,260,Critics of RBC models often focus on the labor market  Because RBC models rely on efficient markets it  follows that unemployment can only be short term  apart from frictional unemployment  if markets are  efficient a person who does not have a job can only be a person who does not want to work  If a person is  unemployed in the context of efficient markets he just needs to lower his wage rate until he finds an employer  who hires him  This assumption is logical because if markets are perfectly flexible all markets must find  equilibrium and full employment 
4,260,Therefore as suggested particularly by the earliest RBC models a person is unemployed because he or she is  asking for wages that are too high or in other words this person s utility function is maximized by having more  leisure  e g  free time to visit museums watch games on TV and enjoy time with friends  and less consumption   which could be increased by giving up some leisure and finding a job   However the observation that during a  recession many people are eagerly searching for jobs and are unable to find employment despite dropping their  asking wages substantially suggests that this theory is unrealistic 
5,260,Although many find this explanation unconvincing RBC theorists argue that undeniably markets would clear  if people were rational and avoided unrealistic expectations of earnings or simply enjoyed their leisure  accompanied by optimally meager consumption 
6,260,An interesting feature of RBC models is that they give aggregate supply a more prominent role than many other  theories  For example supply has a limited importance in the Keynesian theory probably because Keynes was  more concerned with the Great Depression which was largely a crisis of aggregate demand  RBC models show  that supply shocks such as advances in technology or changes in the relative prices of inputs cause the  aggregate supply  AS  to shift left  A new technology can change potential GDP for example thus moving  long run AS to the right  Adjustment will be needed because not all companies can adopt the new technology at  once and therefore short run AS will not jump to the new equilibrium immediately  Similarly an increase of  energy prices shifts short run AS to the left  higher prices and lower GDP   In the long run companies and  households can learn to use less of the expensive energy inputs  substitution effect  and therefore long run AS  will shift right  higher GDP  if the economy learns to produce more goods with less energy 
7,260,       Models with Money
8,260,Inflation is often seen as a cause of business cycles because when monetary policy ends up being too  expansionary the economy grows at an unsustainable pace creating an inflationary gap  The result is that for  example suppliers cannot keep up with demand  In this environment prices will tend to grow faster than  normal that is inflation 
9,260,As a consequence the central bank will often intervene to limit inflation by  tightening  monetary policy which  generally means increasing interest rates so that the cost of borrowing will be higher and demand for goods and  services will slow down  a leftward shift in aggregate demand caused by the higher cost of money   This  response will decrease equilibrium GDP and can result in a recession 
10,260,Given that inflation appears to trigger policy responses from central banks it is an important part of modern  business cycles  Therefore it can be helpful to use models that include money to explain economic growth  As  mentioned earlier RBC models assume that transactions could occur with barter and thus do not explicitly  include money  More recent dynamic general equilibrium models  for example Christiano Eichenbaum and  Evans       include money and inflation 
11,260,Monetary policy can be incorporated into dynamic general equilibrium models with money  In one type of  model the economy receives shocks from changes in technology and consumer preferences  like in the RBC  case  but can also receive shocks from monetary policy which sometimes can tame the business cycle and at  other times may exacerbate it

2,261,Another group of dynamic general equilibrium models are the Neo Keynesians or New Keynesians   Like  the New Classical school the Neo Keynesian school attempts to place macroeconomics on sound  microeconomic foundations  In contrast to the New Classical school the Neo Keynesian school assumes slow  to adjust   sticky   prices and wages  The Neo Keynesian models show that markets do not reach equilibrium  immediately and seamlessly but even small imperfections may cause markets to be in disequilibrium for a long  time  As a consequence government intervention as advocated in the     s by Keynes may be useful to  eliminate unemployment and bring markets toward equilibrium 
3,261,The typical example of these imperfections which also appeared in Keynes  work is that workers do not want  their wages to decrease to help the market reach a new equilibrium  i e  wages are often downwardly sticky     Another possibility that some economists suggested in the     s is called the  menu costs  explanation  It is  costly for companies to continuously adjust prices to make markets clear just like it would be costly for a  restaurant to print new menus daily with updated prices    Another explanation is that every time an economic  shock hits a company the company will need some time to reorganize its production 
4,261,EXAMPLE  
5,261,Real Business Cycle Models
6,261,   The main difference between New Classical  RBC  and Neo Keynesian models is that the New  Classical models 
7,261,A  are monetarist 
8,261,B  use utility maximizing agents whereas Neo Keynesian does not 
9,261,C  assume that prices adjust quickly to changes in supply and demand whereas Neo  Keynesians assume that prices adjust slowly 
10,261,   Basic RBC models focus on the choices of a typical individual who can choose between  consuming more  thus giving up leisure  and enjoying leisure more  thus giving up consumption    What causes persistent unemployment in this model 
11,261,A  Contractionary monetary policy causes a shock to real variables 
12,261,B  The economy returns to equilibrium promptly thus persistent unemployment does not exist 
13,261,C  The utility function  If the individual prefers leisure much more than consumption she will  forego consumption and instead choose unemployment to enjoy more leisure when the  market salary is low 
14,261,Solution to   
15,261,C is correct  A key feature of Neo Keynesian macroeconomics is the stickiness of prices  In contrast  New Classical views assume flexible price adjustments that ensure market clearing 
16,261,Solution to   
17,261,C is correct  Shocks in the standard New Classical model can only have a temporary effect thus A is not  the right answer  Unemployment can still exist when the labor market is cleared so a rational  explanation is provided in C 
18,261,In recent years a consensus concerning business cycles has gradually started building in macroeconomics  It is  too early to say that economists agree on all causes of and remedies for business fluctuations but at least an  analytical framework has emerged which encompasses both New Classical and Neo Keynesian approaches   Woodford        among others shows that new research seems to be leading to a unified approach

2,262,The debate about business cycles often receives a politically partisan treatment in the press because some people  are generally against government intervention in the economy  for example because it may lead to large  deficits  and others are in favor  for example because it may alleviate the effects of a large economic shock   It  is important to base investment decisions on analysis and not on politics  the financial analyst must try as much  as possible to set personal biases aside 
3,262,However there is little doubt that central banks try to manage the business cycle by raising interest rates when  the economy is growing rapidly and inflation accelerates and cutting rates when the economy is weak  In the            downturn when official interest rates approached zero central bankers extended their actions to  include  quantitative easing  to try to lower interest rates further out on the yield curve to stimulate the  economy 
4,262,EXAMPLE  
5,262,Analyzing Government Expenditure
6,262,Simple criteria for the financial analyst wondering whether a government s expenditure is excessive  i e   unsustainably high and or of an inappropriate composition  include the following   
7,262,   Does the government always have a deficit no matter the cyclical phase or does it have surpluses  during economic booms 
8,262,   Does the government have a deficit because of a defined series of necessary investments that will  improve the productivity of the country or is it spending much of its money on questionable uses 
9,262,   Is the growth rate of debt  government budget deficit as a percentage of GDP  higher than GDP  growth  If so the debt level will not likely be sustainable 
10,262,When government expenditures are excessive inflation often follows  After that a recession may occur  because the central bank takes necessary measures to slow down an overheated economy  That is if  government purchases increase aggregate demand too much thus causing inflation  expansionary fiscal  policy  the central bank will intervene to stop prices from increasing too quickly  tightening or  contractionary monetary policy  
11,262,   UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION
12,262,Many governments and central banks have economic policy objectives related to limiting the rate at which  citizens are unemployed and containing price inflation  i e  preserving the purchasing power of a domestic  currency   The relationships of these variables to the business cycle are discussed in the following sections  In  general unemployment is at its highest just as the recovery starts and is at its lowest at the peak of the economy 
13,262,     Unemployment
14,262,A typical cause of business cycle downturns is a tight labor market that is one with low unemployment  An  overheated economy leads to inflation when unemployment is very low  Workers ask for higher wages because  they expect prices of goods and services to keep going up and at the same time they have market power against  employers because there are few available workers to be hired  This upward pressure on wages coupled with the  impact of wage escalator clauses  automatic increases in wages as the consumer price index grows  triggers a  price wage inflationary spiral  This issue was a particular problem in industrialized countries in the     s and      s and remains an issue today

2,263,A key aspect in this process is inflation expectations  Because inflation expectations are high the request for  higher wages is stronger which induces employers to increase prices in advance to keep their profit margins  stable  This avalanche process grows with time  Central banks act sometimes drastically to slow down the  economy and reset inflationary expectations throughout the economy at a low level so that if everyone expects  low inflation the inflationary spiral itself will stop  These actions may trigger a deep recession  Therefore  whenever a financial analyst sees signs of a price wage spiral in the making a reasonable response would be to  consider the effect of both high inflation and sharp tightening of monetary policy 
3,263,This example shows that measures of labor market conditions are important in assessing whether an economy is  at risk of cyclical downturn 
4,263,The following are the definitions of a few terms that are used to summarize the state of the labor market 
5,263,  Employed  The number of people with a job  This figure normally does not include people working in  the informal sector  e g  unlicensed cab drivers illegal workers etc   
6,263,  Labor force  The number of people who either have a job or are actively looking for a job  This number  excludes retirees children stay at home parents full time students and other categories of people who  are neither employed nor actively seeking employment 
7,263,  Unemployed  People who are actively seeking employment but are currently without a job  Some special  subcategories include 
8,263,  Long term unemployed  People who have been out of work for a long time  more than three to  four months in many countries  but are still looking for a job 
9,263,  Frictionally unemployed  People who are not working at the time of filling out the statistical  survey because they are taking time to search for a job that matches their skills interests and other  preferences better than what is currently available or people who have left one job and are about to  start another job  The frictionally unemployed includes people who have voluntarily left their  previous positions in order to change their jobs in other words they are  between jobs  and those  new entrants or re entrants into the labor force who have not yet found work  Frictional  unemployment is short term and transitory in nature
10,263,  Unemployment rate  The ratio of unemployed to labor force 
11,263,  Activity ratio  or participation ratio   The ratio of labor force to total population of working age  i e   those between    and    years of age  
12,263,  Underemployed  A person who has a job but has the qualifications to work at a significantly higher  paying job  For example a lawyer who is out of work and takes a job in a bookstore could call herself  underemployed  This lawyer would count as employed for the computation of the unemployment rate  she  does have a job even if it may not be her highest paying job   Although the unemployment rate statistic is  criticized for not taking the issue of underemployment into account it may be difficult to classify whether  a person is truly underemployed for example the lawyer may find legal work too stressful and prefers  working at the bookstore  However data for part time working is sometimes a good proxy 
13,263,  Discouraged worker  A person who has stopped looking for a job  Perhaps because of a weak economy  the discouraged worker has given up seeking employment  Discouraged workers are statistically outside  the labor force  similar to children and retirees  which means they are not counted in the official  unemployment rate  During prolonged recessions the unemployment rate may actually decrease because  many discouraged workers stop seeking work  It is important to observe the participation rate together  with the unemployment rate to understand if unemployment is decreasing because of an improved  economy or because of an increase in discouraged workers  Discouraged workers and underemployed  people may be considered examples of  hidden unemployment  
14,263,  Voluntarily unemployed  person voluntarily outside the labor force such as a jobless worker refusing  an available vacancy for which the wage is lower than their threshold or those who retired early

2,264,       The Unemployment Rate
3,264,The unemployment rate is certainly the most quoted measure of unemployment  it attempts to measure those  people who have no work but would work if they could find it generally stated as a percentage of the overall  labor force  In the United States the indicator emerges from a monthly survey of households by the US Bureau  of Labor Statistics which asks how many household members have jobs and how many of working age do not  have jobs but are seeking work  Other statistical bureaus rely on other sources for the calculation using claims  for unemployment assistance for instance or their equivalent  Some statistical bureaus measure the labor force  simply as those of working age regardless of whether they are ready or willing to work  These differences can  make precise international comparisons problematic  One solution is to use the International Labour  Organization  ILO  statistics that try to estimate on a consistent basis  As indicated earlier some statistical  agencies add perspective with other measures  for example what proportion of those who have ceased work are  discouraged underemployed or have opted out of the labor force for other reasons or are working part time 
4,264,Although these various unemployment measures provide insight to the state of the economy they are inaccurate  in pointing to cyclical directions for two primary reasons both of which make unemployment a lagging  economic indicator of the business cycle 
5,264,One reason is that the unemployment rate tends to point to a past economic condition that is it lags the  cycle because the labor force expands and declines in response to the economic environment  Compounding  the inaccuracy when times get hard discouraged workers cease searching for work reducing the number  typically counted as unemployed and making the jobs market look stronger than it really is  Conversely when  the jobs market picks up these people return to the search and because they seldom find work immediately  they at least initially raise the calculation of those unemployed giving the false impression of the lack of  recovery in the jobs market when in fact it is the improvement that brought these people back into the labor  force in the first place  Sometimes this cyclical flow of new jobs seekers is so great that the unemployment rate  actually rises even as the economic recovery gains momentum  Those agencies that measure the labor force in  terms of the working age population avoid this bias because this measure  working age population  is  unaffected by economic conditions in the labor market  But this approach introduces biases of its own such as  counting as unemployed those people who have severe disabilities and could never seek work 
6,264,The second reason the unemployment indicator tends to lag the cycle comes from the typical reluctance of  businesses to lay off people  The reluctance may stem from a desire to retain good workers for the long run or  just reflect constraints written into labor contracts that make layoffs expensive  The reluctance makes the  various measures of unemployment rise more slowly as the economy slides into recession than they otherwise  might  Then as the recovery develops a business waits to hire until it has fully employed the workers it has kept  on the payroll during the recession  this delay causes decreases in the unemployment rate to lag in the cyclical  recovery sometimes for a long time 
7,264,       Overall Payroll Employment and Productivity Indicators
8,264,To get a better picture of the employment cycle practitioners often rely on more straightforward measures of  payroll growth  By measuring the size of payrolls practitioners sidestep such issues as the ebb and flow of  discouraged workers  These statistics however do have biases of their own  It is hard for instance to count  employment in smaller businesses which may be significant drivers of employment growth  Still there is a  clear indication of economic trouble when payrolls shrink and a clear indication of recovery when they rise 
9,264,The examination of other measures can also assist in understanding the employment situation and its use in  determining cyclical directions  Two additional measures are hours worked especially overtime and the use of  temporary workers  A business does not want to make mistakes with full time staff either hiring or firing  Thus  at the first signs of economic weakness managers cut back hours especially overtime  Such movements can  simply reflect minor month to month production shifts but if followed by cutbacks in part time and temporary  staff the picture gives a strong signal of economic weakness especially if confirmed by other independent  indicators  Similarly on the cyclical upswing a business turns first to increases in overtime and hours  If a  business then increases temporary staffing it gives a good signal of economic recovery long before any  movement in rehiring fulltime staff again especially if confirmed by independent cyclical indicators

2,265,Productivity measures also offer insight into this cyclical process  Because productivity is usually measured by  dividing output by hours worked a business s tendency to keep workers on the payroll even as output falls  usually prompts a reduction in measured productivity  If measures are available promptly enough this sign of  cyclical weakness might precede even the change in hours  This drop in productivity precedes any change in  full time payrolls  Productivity also responds promptly when business conditions improve and the business first  begins to utilize its underemployed workers which occurs earlier than any upturn in full time payrolls 
3,265,On a more fundamental level productivity can also pick up in response to technological breakthroughs or  improved training techniques  As already mentioned such changes affect potential GDP  If strong enough they  can negatively affect employment trends keeping them slower than they would be otherwise by relieving the  need for additional staff to increase production  But these influences usually unfold over decades and mean little  to cyclical considerations which at most unfold over years  What is more there are few statistical indicators to  gauge the onset of technological change confining analysts to the use of anecdotal evidence or occasional  longitudinal studies 
4,265,EXAMPLE  
5,265,Analyzing Unemployment
6,265,   At the peak of the business cycle if the unemployment rate is low the majority of the unemployed  are most likely 
7,265,A  discouraged workers 
8,265,B  long term unemployed 
9,265,C  frictionally unemployed 
10,265,   As an economy starts to recover from a trough in the business cycle the unemployment rate is  most likely to 
11,265,A  continue to rise with a decline in the number of discouraged workers 
12,265,B  start to decline with an increase in the number of discouraged workers 
13,265,C  continue to rise with an increase in the number of discouraged workers 
14,265,   An analyst observes that the unemployment rate is high and rising whereas productivity and hours  worked have declined  The analyst is most likely to conclude that the labor market is signaling the 
15,265,A  end of a recession 
16,265,B  deepening of a recession 
17,265,C  peak of the business cycle 
18,265,Solution to   
19,265,C is correct  At the peak of a business cycle the labor market is usually tight and people become  unemployed largely because they are either  between jobs  or they have entered or reentered the labor  force but have not yet found work 
20,265,Solution to   
21,265,A is correct  As the economy starts to recover discouraged workers return to the labor force and start  looking for jobs which increases both the number of unemployed and the size of the labor force  The  unemployment rate rises because the rise in the unemployed population is proportionately larger than the  increase in the size of the labor force  B and C are incorrect because an increase in the number of  discouraged workers typically occurs when the economy is contracting

2,266,Solution to   
3,266,B is correct  High and rising unemployment declining hours worked and falling productivity are all  signs of a weak economy getting weaker  When the economy first slows down businesses cut back  employees  hours  As the recession deepens they then lay off employees leading to a higher  unemployment rate  Yet because workforce turnover is costly for businesses the scale of the layoff can  be less than the decline in output resulting in a decline in productivity  A is incorrect because toward the  end of a recession businesses are hesitant to increase hiring and instead use more overtime increasing  both productivity and the hours worked  C is incorrect because at the peak of a business cycle the  unemployment rate is usually low and the level of hours worked is high 
4,266,     Inflation
5,266,The overall price level changes at varying rates during different phases of a business cycle  Thus when studying  business cycles it is important to understand this phenomenon  In general the inflation rate is pro cyclical  that  is it goes up and down with the cycle  but with a lag of a year or more 
6,266,Inflation refers to a sustained rise in the overall level of prices in an economy  Economists use various price  indexes to measure the overall price level also called the aggregate price level  The inflation rate is the  percentage change in a price index that is the speed of overall price level movements  Investors follow the  inflation rate closely not only because it can help to infer the state of the economy but also because an  unexpected change may result in a change in monetary policy which can in turn have a large and immediate  impact on asset prices  In developing countries very high inflation rates can lead to social unrest or even shifts  of political power which constitutes political risk for investments in those economies 
7,266,Central banks the monetary authority in most economies monitor the domestic inflation rates closely when  conducting monetary policy  Monetary policy determines interest rates and the available quantities of money  and loans in an economy  A high inflation rate combined with fast economic growth and low unemployment  usually indicates the economy is overheating which may trigger some policy movements to cool it down   However if a high inflation rate is combined with a high level of unemployment and a slowdown of the  economy an economic state known as stagflation  for stagnation plus inflation  the economy will typically  be left to correct itself because no short term economic policy is thought to be effective 
8,266,       Deflation Hyperinflation and Disinflation
9,266,There are various terms related to the levels and changes of the inflation rate 
10,266,  Deflation  A sustained decrease in aggregate price level which corresponds to a negative inflation  rate that is an inflation rate of less than    
11,266,  Hyperinflation  An extremely fast increase in aggregate price level which corresponds to an extremely  high inflation rate for example      to       per year 
12,266,  Disinflation  A decline in the inflation rate such as from around     to     to    or     Disinflation is  very different from deflation because even after a period of disinflation the inflation rate remains positive  and the aggregate price level keeps rising  although at a slower speed  
13,266,Inflation means that the same amount of money can purchase less real goods or services in the future  So the  value of money or the purchasing power of money decreases in an inflationary environment  When deflation  occurs the value of money actually increases  Because most debt contracts are written in fixed monetary  amounts the liability of a borrower also rises in real terms during deflation  As the price level falls the revenue  of a typical company also falls during a recession  Facing increasing real debt a company that is short of cash  usually cuts its spending investment and workforce sharply  Less spending and high unemployment then  further exacerbate the economic contraction  To avoid getting too close to deflation the consensus on the  preferred inflation rate is around    per year for developed economies  Deflation occurred in the United States  during the Great Depression and briefly during the recession following the global financial crisis of             Since the late     s Japan has experienced several episodes of deflation

2,267,Hyperinflation usually occurs when large scale government spending is not backed by real tax revenue and the  monetary authority accommodates government spending by increasing the money supply  Hyperinflation may  also be caused by the shortage of supply created during or after a war economic regime transition or prolonged  economic distress of an economy caused by political instability  During hyperinflation people are eager to  change their cash into real goods because prices are rising very fast  As a result money changes hands at  extremely high frequency  The government also has to print more money to support its increased spending  As  more cash chases a limited supply of goods and services the rate of price increases accelerates  After World  War I a famous case of hyperinflation occurred in Germany from      to       During the peak of this episode  prices doubled every     days  After World War II Hungary experienced a severe hyperinflation during which  prices doubled every      hours at its peak in       In      the inflation rate in Ukraine peaked at        per  year  In January      the monthly inflation rate peaked at     million percent in Yugoslavia  The most recent  hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reached a peak of monthly inflation at      billion percent in the middle of  November       Because the basic cause for hyperinflation is too much money in circulation regaining control  of the money supply is the key to ending hyperinflation 
3,267,Exhibit   shows recent episodes of disinflation in selected countries around the world  The first episode  happened during the early     s  Because of the two oil crises in the     s many countries around the world  were experiencing high levels of inflation  In Exhibit   the annual inflation rates in most counties around       ranged between     and      Even though this level is still far from hyperinflation it generated social pressure  against inflationary monetary policy  At the cost of a severe recession early in the     s these countries brought  inflation rates down to around    on average by       In the first years of the     s inflationary experience  varied widely in world markets as some countries entered recessions such as the United States and the United  Kingdom and others boomed  However from the beginning to the end of the decade there was a broad based  decline in inflation rates  in some countries annual inflation rates were below    by the end of the decade  In  many countries the decline in inflation was attributed to high productivity growth rates

2,268,       Measuring Inflation  The Construction of Price Indexes
3,268,Because the inflation rate is measured as the percentage change of a price index it is important to understand  how a price index is constructed so that the inflation rate derived from that index can be accurately interpreted   A price index represents the average prices of a basket of goods and services and various methods can be used  to average the different prices  Exhibit   shows a simple example of the change of a consumption basket over  time 
4,268,Exhibit    Consumption Basket and Prices over Two Months
5,268,Time Goods Rice Gasoline
6,268,January      Quantity Price    kg    kg    liters      liter
7,268,February      Quantity Price    kg    kg    liters      liter
8,268,For January      the total value of the consumption basket is 
9,268,Value of rice   Value of gasoline                               
10,268,A price index uses the relative weight of a good in a basket to weight the price in the index  Therefore the same  consumption basket in February      is worth 
11,268,Value of rice   Value of gasoline                               
12,268,The price index in the base period is usually set to      So if the price index in January      is     then the  price index in February      is
13,268,Price index in February

16,268,Inflation rate  
17,268,          
18,268,                     
19,268,A price index created by holding the composition of the consumption basket constant is called a Laspeyres  index  Most price indexes around the world are Laspeyres indexes because the survey data on the consumption  basket is only available with a lag  In many countries the basket is updated every five years  Because most price  indexes are created to measure the cost of living simply using a fixed basket of goods and services has three  serious biases 
20,268,  Substitution bias  As the price of one good or service rises people may substitute it with other goods or  services that have a lower price  This substitution will result in an upward bias in the measured inflation  rate based on a Laspeyres index 
21,268,  Quality bias  As the quality of the same product improves over time it satisfies people s needs and wants  better  One such example is the quality of cars  Over the years the prices of cars have been rising but the  safety and reliability of cars have also been enhanced  If not adjusted for quality the measured inflation  rate will experience another upward bias 
22,268,  New product bias  New products are frequently introduced and a fixed basket of goods and services will  not include them  In general this situation again creates an upward bias in the inflation rate 
23,268,It is relatively easy to resolve the quality bias and new product bias  Many countries adjust for the quality of the  products in a basket a practice called hedonic pricing  New products can be introduced into the basket over  time  The substitution bias can be somewhat resolved by using chained price index formula  One such example  is the Fisher index which is the geometric mean of the Laspeyres index and the Paasche index  The latter is  an index formula using the current composition of the basket  Using the consumption basket for February       in Exhibit   the value of the Paasche index is

2,270,The producer price index  PPI  is another important inflation measure  The PPI reflects the price changes  experienced by domestic producers in a country  Because price increases may eventually pass through to  consumers the PPI can influence the future CPI  The items in the PPI include fuels farm products  such as  grains and meat  machinery and equipment chemical products  such as drugs and paints  transportation  equipment metals pulp and paper and so on  These products are usually further grouped by stage of processing  categories  crude materials intermediate materials and finished goods  Similar to the CPI scope and weights  vary among countries  The differences in the weights can be much more dramatic for the PPI than for the CPI  because different countries may specialize in different industries  In some countries the PPI is called the  wholesale price index  WPI  
3,270,As an important inflation indicator many economic activities are indexed to a certain price index  For example  the United States  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS  adjusts the bond s principal according to  the US CPI U index  The terms of labor contracts and commercial real estate leases may adjust periodically  according to the CPI  Recurring payments in business contracts can be linked to the PPI or its sub indexes for a  particular category of products 
4,270,Central banks usually use a consumer price index to monitor inflation  For example the European Central Bank   the ECB  the central bank for the European Union  EU  focuses on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   HICP   Each member country in the EU first reports their own individual HICP and then Eurostat the statistical  office for the EU aggregates the country level HICPs with country weights  But there are exceptions  The  Reserve Bank of India follows the inflation in India using a WPI  Because food items only represent about      in the India WPI  much lower than the     in the India rural CPI  the rural CPIs can rise faster than the WPI  when there is high food price inflation  Besides the weight differences the wholesale prices in the WPI also  understate market prices because they do not take into account retail margins  markups   The choice of inflation  indicator may also change over time  The central bank of the United States known as the Federal Reserve Board   the Fed  once focused on the CPI U produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the US Department of  Labor  Because the CPI U is a Laspeyres index and it has the previously discussed upward biases the Fed  switched in      to the PCE index a Fisher index produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis under the US  Department of Commerce  The PCE index also has the advantage that it covers the complete range of consumer  spending rather than just a basket 
5,270,Headline and Core Inflation
6,270,Headline inflation refers to the inflation rate calculated based on the price index that includes all goods  and services in an economy  Core inflation usually refers to the inflation rate calculated based on a  price index of goods and services except food and energy  Policymakers often choose to focus on the  core inflation rate when reading the trend in the economy and making economic policies  The reason is  that policymakers are trying to avoid overreaction to short term fluctuations in food and energy prices  that may not have a significant impact on future headline inflation 
7,270,The ultimate goal for policymakers is to control headline inflation which reflects the actual cost of  living  The fluctuations in the prices of food and energy are often the result of short term changes in  supply and demand  These changes in the prices of energy particularly oil are internationally  determined and not necessarily reflective of the domestic business cycle  These imbalances may not  persist or even if some changes are permanent the economy may be able to absorb them over time   These possibilities make headline inflation a noisy predictor  The core inflation rate may be a better  signal of the trend in domestically driven inflation  To the extent that some trends in the headline  inflation rate are permanent policymakers need to pay attention to these as well 
8,270,Besides tracking inflation financial analysts also use the price index to deflate GDP  i e  to eliminate the price  effect in nominal GDP data so as to identify trends in real economic growth   Many countries publish a  particular price index called the GDP deflator for that purpose  Sub indexes are also commonly available and  may prove more valuable to an analyst with an interest in a particular industry or company

2,271,Sub Indexes and Relative Prices
3,271,As mentioned previously a sub index refers to the price index for a particular category of goods or  services  Relative price is the price of a specific good or service in comparison with those of other  goods and services  Good examples for relative prices include the prices for food and energy  The  movements in a sub index or a relative price may be difficult to detect in the headline inflation rate   Because macroeconomic policy decision makers rely heavily on the headline inflation rate they may not  be aware of price movements at the sub index level  These prices movements however can be very  useful for analyzing the prospects of an industry or a company  For example if the producer price index  for the machinery used by an industry rises quickly the allowable capital depreciation permitted by the  existing tax code may not generate sufficient tax benefits for the companies in that industry to meet  future replacement expenses  The future profitability of the industry may decline for this reason  The  decline in prices for flat screen televisions provides an example of relative price movements  The price  drop for these TVs may help to lower inflation pressure but can hurt manufacturers  profits

6,271,   Which one of the following statements regarding the movements of overall price levels is most accurate 
7,271,A  Disinflation means that the overall price level declines 
8,271,B  Deflation occurs when the inflation rate turns negative 
9,271,C  When the price of chicken rises the inflation rate will increase 
10,271,   Deflation can exacerbate a recession because firms may reduce their investments and hiring when 
11,271,A  the slower pace of inflation lowers aggregate demand 
12,271,B  their revenues decline but their debt burden rises in real terms 
13,271,C  prices of their products continue to fall because of intense competition 
14,271,   Which one of the following economic phenomena related to inflation cannot be determined by  using observations of the inflation rate alone 
15,271,A  Deflation
16,271,B  Stagflation
17,271,C  Hyperinflation
18,271,   If a price index is calculated based on a fixed basket of goods in an inflationary environment the  inflation rate calculated based on this index over time will 
19,271,A  overstate the actual cost of living 
20,271,B  understate the actual cost of living

6,272,A  the sub index of the wholesale price index  WPI  for that industry 
7,272,B  the sub indexes of both the CPI and WPI that are relevant to the industry 
8,272,C  the sub indexes of the CPI relevant to the output and inputs of that industry 
9,272,   Compared with core inflation headline inflation 
10,272,A  has an upward bias 
11,272,B  is more subject to short term market conditions 
12,272,C  can more accurately predict future inflation 
13,272,Solution to   
14,272,B is correct  When the inflation rate falls below zero that is the overall price level declines the  economy is experiencing deflation  A is incorrect because disinflation indicates that the overall price  level is rising but at a slower pace  C is incorrect because inflation measures are designed to reflect  changes in the overall price level  Consumption baskets in modern economies usually contain a large  number of goods and services thus the price of a particular product usually cannot significantly  influence the overall price level 
15,272,Solution to   
16,272,B is correct  As the prices of the output of firms fall the firms receive lower revenues  Because the  nominal amount of debt that firms carry is usually fixed lower general price levels leads to higher debt  balances in real terms  These two forces push firms closer to default so they may scale back spending on  investments and labor which in turn further lowers the aggregate demand and pushes the general price  level even lower  In macroeconomic analysis it is usually the changes in aggregate demand that  influence inflation instead of the reverse causality  Furthermore neither inflation fluctuations nor  aggregate demand shifts explain the potential damaging effect of deflation  Price decline attributable to  the competitive environment is a microeconomic phenomenon that is not sufficient to explain the  macroeconomic impact of deflation 
17,272,Solution to   
18,272,B is correct  A high inflation rate alone does not indicate stagflation which happens if high  unemployment occurs together with high inflation 
19,272,Solution to   
20,272,A is correct  Upward biases such as the substitution bias or quality bias will overstate the actual cost of  living 
21,272,Solution to   
22,272,B is correct  The GDP deflator reflects the prices of the goods and services produced domestically  Both  the CPI and PCE indexes are constructed using consumption baskets and the components of a  consumption basket can be very different from the components of output of that same country

2,273,Solution to   
3,273,B is correct  A sub index of the CPI reflects the market price changes of the products of an industry  whereas a sub index of the WPI reflects the price changes of the inputs of an industry  The different  composition of outputs and inputs of an industry need to be appropriately accounted for when selecting a  price series  Furthermore the WPI may not take the markups set by the industry into account 
4,273,Solution to   
5,273,B is correct  Headline inflation is heavily influenced by food and energy price fluctuations which are  affected by short term supply and demand changes in these markets  These market conditions may not  persist  It is also possible for an economy to absorb the price changes so that they will not have long  lasting impact on the headline inflation rate  This means headline inflation contains a great deal of noise  and is not a reliable predictor of future inflation trends  The biases in various inflation measures are  inherent in the index construction methodology and are not related to the price movements of the goods  and services 
6,273,       Explaining Inflation
7,273,Economists describe two types of inflation  cost push in which rising costs usually wages compel businesses  to raise prices generally  and demand pull in which increasing demand raise prices generally which then are  reflected in a business s costs as workers demand wage hikes to catch up with the rising cost of living  Whatever  the sequence by which prices and costs rise in an economy the fundamental cause is the same  excessive  demands either for raw materials finished goods or labor that outstrip the economy s ability to respond  The  initial signs appear in the areas with the greatest constraints  the labor market the commodity market or in some  area of final output  Even before examining particular cost and price measures practitioners when considering  inflation look to indicators that might reveal when the economy faces such constraints 
8,273,         Cost Push Inflation
9,273,In the area of cost push inflation analysts may look at commodity prices because commodities are an input to  production  But because wages are the single biggest cost to businesses practitioners focus most particularly on  wage push inflation which is tied to the labor market  Because the object is to gauge demand for labor relative  to capacity the unemployment rate is key as well as measures of the number of workers available to meet the  economy s expanding needs  Obviously the higher the unemployment rate the lower the likelihood that  shortages will develop in labor markets whereas the lower the unemployment rate the greater likelihood that  shortages will drive up wages  Because the unemployment rate generally only counts people who are looking for  work some practitioners argue that it fails to account for the economy s full labor potential and they state that a  tight labor market will bring people out in search of work and ease any potential wage strains  To account for  this issue and to modify the unemployment rate indicator these practitioners also look at the participation rate of  people in the labor force arguing that it gives a fuller and more accurate picture of potential than the  unemployment rate 
10,273,Analysis in this area recognizes that not all labor is alike  Structural factors related to training deficiencies  cultural patterns in all or some of the population inefficiencies in the labor market and the like can mean that  the economy will effectively face labor shortages long before the unemployment rate reaches very low figures   This effective unemployment rate below which pressure emerges in labor markets is frequently referred to as  the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment  NAIRU  or drawing on the work of the Nobel Prize  winner Milton Friedman the natural rate of unemployment  NARU   Of course these rates vary from one  economy to another and over time in a single economy  It is this rate rather than full employment that  determines when an economy will experience bottlenecks in the labor market and wage push inflationary  pressures

2,274,Take for example the technology sector  It has grown so rapidly in some economies that training in the labor  force cannot keep up with demand  This sector can as a consequence face shortages of trained workers and  attendant wage pressures even though the economy as a whole seems to have considerable slack in the overall  labor market  Until training  supply  catches up with demand that economy may experience wage and inflation  pressure at rates of unemployment that in other places and circumstances might suggest ample slack in the labor  market and much less wage push pressure 
3,274,Assessments of wage push inflation also consider direct observations of wage trends that when they accelerate  might force businesses to raise prices  initiating the wage price spiral mentioned earlier in this reading    Statistical agencies provide a wide array of wage cost indicators such as hourly wage gauges weekly earnings  and overall labor costs including the outlays for benefits  Some of these indicators include the effects of special  overtime pay or bonuses others do not  And although these measures give an idea of the cost to businesses and  hence the kind of wage push inflationary pressure a complete picture only emerges when practitioners examine  such trends alongside productivity measures 
4,274,Productivity or output per hour is an essential part of wage push inflation analysis because the output available  from each worker determines the number of units over which businesses can spread the cost of worker  compensation  The greater each worker s output is per hour the lower price businesses need to charge for each  unit of output to cover hourly labor costs  And by extension the faster output per hour grows the faster labor  compensation can expand without putting undue pressure on businesses  costs per unit of output  The equation  for this unit labor cost  ULC  indicator as it is called is as follows 
5,274,ULC   W O
6,274,where
7,274,ULC   unit labor costs
8,274,O   output per hour per worker
9,274,W   total labor compensation per hour per worker
10,274,Many factors can affect labor productivity across time and between economies  The cyclical swings have  already been described as have the effects of technology and training  The pace of development also tends to  increase worker productivity because the more sophisticated equipment systems and technologies workers have  at their disposal the higher their output per hour  Whatever causes the productivity growth if it fails to keep up  with worker compensation unit costs to a business rise and as a business tries to protect its profit margins  prices generally come under increasing upward pressure  Generally this situation occurs because heavy demand  for labor relative to available labor resources has pushed up compensation faster than productivity  Practitioners  use a variety of indicators to identify cost  or wage push inflationary pressure 
11,274,EXAMPLE   
12,274,Unemployment Too High
13,274,Which of the following is not a problem with the NARU and NAIRU 
14,274,A  They only work in monetarist models 
15,274,B  They may change over time given changes in technology and economic structure 
16,274,C  They do not account for bottlenecks in segments of the labor market  e g  college graduates  
17,274,Solution 
18,274,A is correct  The NARU and NAIRU are the unemployment rates at which the inflation rate will not rise  because of a shortage of labor  This concept does not tie to a particular school of macroeconomic  models

2,275,         Demand Pull Inflation
3,275,The search for indicators from the demand pull side of the inflation question brings practitioners back to the  relationship between actual and potential real GDP and industrial capacity utilization  The higher the rate of  capacity utilization or the closer actual GDP is to potential the more likely an economy will suffer shortages  bottlenecks a general inability to satisfy demand and hence price increases  The more an economy operates  below its potential or the lower the rate of capacity utilization the less such supply pressure will exist and the  greater likelihood of a slowdown in inflation or outright deflation  In addition to these macro indicators  practitioners will also look for signs of inflationary pressure in commodity prices in part because they are a cost  to business but more as a general sign of excess demand  For an individual economy observations of  commodity prices could be misleading because commodities trade in a global market and accordingly reflect  global economic conditions more than those in an individual economy 
4,275,Taking a different perspective Monetarists contend that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon  A  surplus of money they argue will inflate the money price of everything in the economy  Stated in terms of  straightforward supply and demand relationships a surplus of money would bring down its value just as a  surplus in any market would bring down the price of the product in excess  Because the price of money is stated  in terms of the products it can buy its declining value would have an expression in higher prices generally that  is in inflation  This Monetarist argument as it is called finds a more simple expression in the old saying that  inflation results when too much money chases too few goods  Although it seems distant from other explanations  of inflation in practice it is not that distinct  The excess of money creates the inflation by increasing liquidity  which ultimately causes a rapid rise in demand  In this sense the Monetarist argument is a special case under the  more general heading of demand pull concepts of inflation  The practical distinction between the monetarist and  other approaches is in identifying the initial cause of the demand excess 
5,275,Practitioners can track this effect by examining various money supply indicators usually provided by the central  bank  To detect an inflationary potential or the opposite they note accelerations or decelerations in money  growth from past trends  Obviously accelerations in the absence of a special explanation signal the potential  for inflationary pressure  In applying this approach practitioners also compare money growth with the growth of  the nominal economy represented by nominal GDP  If money growth outpaces the growth of the nominal  economy there is an inflationary potential especially if money growth has also accelerated from its trend  There  is a disinflationary or deflationary potential if money growth trails the economy s rate of expansion especially if  it has also decelerated from its trend 
6,275,Inflation  I 
7,275,Some practitioners view the likelihood of inflationary pressure from the vantage point of the ratio of  nominal GDP to money supply commonly called the  velocity of money   If this ratio remains stable  around a constant or a historical trend they see reason to look for relative price stability  If velocity falls  it could suggest a surplus of money that might have inflationary potential but much depends on why it  has declined  If velocity has fallen because a cyclical correction has brought down the GDP numerator  relative to the money denominator then practitioners view prospects as more likely to lead to a cyclical  upswing to reestablish the former relationship than inflationary pressure  If velocity has fallen however  because of an increase in the money denominator then inflationary pressure becomes more likely  If  velocity rises financial analysts might be concerned about a shortage of money in the economy and  disinflation or deflation 
8,275,The           global recession and financial crisis offers an extreme example of these velocity  ambiguities  As the global economy slipped into recession which held back the GDP numerator in  velocity measures central banks most notably the Federal Reserve in the United States tried to help  financial institutions cope by injecting huge amounts of money into their respective financial systems  raising the velocity denominator  Velocity measures plummeted accordingly  The expectation is that  subsequent GDP growth as economies and financial markets heal will bring velocity back to a more  normal level and trend  That said the fear is that the monetary surge will over the very long run lead to  inflation  For policy makers this situation has created a very difficult policy choice  On the one side  they need to sustain the supply of money to help their respective economies cope with the after effects of  the financial crisis  On the other side they need ultimately to withdraw any monetary excess to preclude  potential inflationary pressures

2,276,       Inflation Expectations
3,276,Beyond demand pull monetary and cost push inflation considerations practitioners also need to account for the  effect of inflation expectations  Once inflation becomes embedded in an economy businesses workers  consumers and economic actors of every kind begin to expect it and build those expectations into their actions   This reaction in turn creates an inflationary momentum of its own  Such expectations give inflation something  of a self sustaining character and cause it to persist in an economy even after its initial cause has disappeared   High inflation rates persisted in the     s and early     s in Europe and the United States on the basis of  expectations even after these economies had sunk into recession  The resulting slow or negative economic  growth combined with high unemployment and rising inflation was termed  stagflation  
4,276,Measuring inflation expectations is not easy  Some practitioners gauge expectations by relying on past inflation  trends and on the assumption that market participants largely extrapolate their past experiences  In some  markets surveys of inflation expectations are available although these are often biased by the way the questions  are asked  Another indicator of inflation expectations becomes available when governments issue bonds such as  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  TIPS  that adjust in various ways to compensate holders for inflation   By comparing the interest available on these bonds with other government bonds that do not offer such  inflation linked adjustments practitioners can gauge the general level of inflation expectations among market  participants and factor it into their own inflation forecasts and strategies 
5,276,For example if today s yield on the    year nominal bond of a certain country is      and the yield on the     year inflation protected bond of the same country is      we infer that the market is pricing in a                   average annual inflation over the next    years  However this calculation needs to be treated with caution  because the market for inflation linked bonds is relatively small and thus yields can be influenced by other  factors such as the very strong demand from US pension funds seeking to match their liabilities 
6,276,EXAMPLE   
7,276,Inflation  II 
8,276,   To examine whether there is inflationary pressure caused by rising costs an analyst will most  likely gather data on

2,278,Solution to   
3,278,C is correct  The table shows that growth in the money supply has outpaced nominal GDP growth which  can result in too much money chasing too few goods  In other words inflation pressure results from  demand beyond the economy s current capacity to produce  Although the wage rate is rising the  negative unit labor cost growth rate indicates an increase in productivity  Thus it is unlikely the  economy will experience cost push inflation  The implied inflation rate is very modest which is unlikely  to lead to a rising inflation rate

17,278,As used in business cycle contexts an economic indicator is a variable that provides information on the state  of the overall economy  Economic indicators are often classified according to whether they lag lead or coincide  with changes in an economy s growth  Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede  those of the overall economy  They are believed to have value for predicting the economy s future state usually  near term  Coincident economic indicators have turning points that are usually close to those of the overall  economy  They are believed to have value for identifying the economy s present state  Lagging economic  indicators have turning points that take place later than those of the overall economy  They are believed to  have value in identifying the economy s past condition 
18,278,To get as clear of a picture as possible practitioners frequently consider several related indicators  simultaneously  What follows is a review of these indicators and how practitioners use them

2,279,     Popular Economic Indicators
3,279,A very useful approach for practitioners is to take an aggregate perspective on leading lagging and coincident  indicators  These aggregate measures typically are a composite of economic indicators known respectively to  lead the cycle run coincident with it or lag it at cyclical turns  For obvious reasons the leading indicators in  particular help with anticipating cyclical turns up or down and allow strategists and others to position  themselves and their companies in a secure and timely way to benefit from movements in the economic cycle 
4,279,The exact indicators combined into these composites vary from one economy to the other  Even within an  economy they can have a remarkably diverse and eclectic character  In the United States for instance the  composite leading indicator known as the Index of Leading Economic Indicators  LEI  has    component  parts that run the gamut from orders for capital goods to changes in consumer expectations to swings in stock  prices  Such composite indicators in other countries include equally eclectic combinations 
5,279,Similar statistics are available for numerous economies  The Conference Board a US industry research  organization computes leading lagging and coincident indicators for the United States and nine other countries  plus the Euro area  Eurozone   For about    countries and several aggregates such as the EU and G   the  Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development  OECD  calculates CLI  Composite Leading  Indicators  indexes which gauge the state of the business cycle in the economy  One of the interesting features  of CLI indexes is that they are consistent across countries and therefore can be compared more easily to see  how each region is faring  The Economic Cycle Research Institute  ECRI  a private company also computes  leading indicator indexes for about    countries on a weekly basis 
6,279,Although specifics for leading coincident and lagging indicators vary from one economy to another they have  much in common  In each case they bring together various economic and financial measures that have  displayed a consistently leading coincident or lagging relationship to that economy s general cycle  However  as reported by the Conference Board the timing record of the various composite indexes for the United States  has varied over the last    years  The coincident index closely matches the NBER peak and trough dates with    of the last    turning points corresponding to the beginning or end of a recession  The leading indicator index  displays more variability leading cyclical contractions by   to    months and expansions by   to    months   
7,279,Exhibit   presents the    leading   coincident and   lagging indicators tracked for the United States by the  Conference Board  In addition to naming the indicators it also offers a general description of why each measure  fits in each of the three groups 
8,279,Exhibit    Leading Coincident and Lagging Indicators United States
9,279,Indicator and Description Leading    Average weekly hours  manufacturing
10,279,   Average weekly initial  claims for unemployment  insurance
11,279,   Manufacturers  new orders  for consumer goods and  materials
12,279,   ISM new order indexa
13,279,Reason
14,279,Because businesses will cut overtime before laying off workers  in a downturn and increase it before rehiring in a cyclical  upturn these measures move up and down before the general  economy   This measure offers a very sensitive test of initial layoffs and  rehiring 
15,279,Because businesses cannot wait too long to meet demands for  consumer goods or materials without ordering these gauges  tend to lead at upturns and downturns  Indirectly they capture  changes in business sentiment as well which also often leads  the cycle   This index is a diffusion index that reflects the month to month  change in new orders for final sales  The weakening of  demand which can lead to a recession is usually first reflected  in the decline of new orders

2,280,Indicator and Description Leading    Manufacturers  new orders  for non defense capital  goods excluding aircraft
3,280,Reason
4,280,In addition to offering a first signal of movement up or down  in an important economic sector movement in this area also  indirectly captures business expectations 
5,280,   Building permits for new  private housing units
6,280,Because most localities require permits before new building  can begin this gauge foretells new construction activity 
7,280,   S P     Index
8,280,   Leading Credit Index
9,280,   Interest rate spread between     year treasury yields and  overnight borrowing rates   federal funds rate 
10,280,    Average Consumer  Expectations for Business  and Economic Conditions
11,280,Because stock prices anticipate economic turning points both  up and down their movements offer a useful early signal on  economic cycles   This index aggregates the information from six leading  financial indicators which reflect the strength of the financial  system to endure stress  A vulnerable financial system can  amplify and propagate the effects of negative shocks resulting  in a widespread recession for the whole economy   Because long term yields express market expectations about  the direction of short term interest rates and rates ultimately  follow the economic cycle up and down a wider spread by  anticipating short rate increases also anticipates an economic  upswing  Conversely a narrower spread by anticipating short  rate decreases also anticipates an economic downturn   If consumers are optimistic about future business and  economic conditions they tend to increase spending  Because  consumption is about two thirds of the US economy its future  movements offers early insight into the direction ahead for the  whole economy 
12,280,Coincident    Employees on non  agricultural payrolls
13,280,Once recession or recovery is clear businesses adjust their  fulltime payrolls 
14,280,   Aggregate real personal  income  less transfer  payments 
15,280,By measuring the income flow from non corporate profits  and wages this measure captures the current state of the  economy 
16,280,   Industrial Production Index
17,280,   Manufacturing and trade  sales
18,280,Measures industrial output thus capturing the behavior of the  most volatile part of the economy  The service sector tends to  be more stable   In the same way as aggregate personal income and the  industrial production index this aggregate offers a measure  of the current state of business activity 
19,280,Lagging    Average Duration of  Unemployment
20,280,Because businesses wait until downturns look genuine to lay off and  wait until recoveries look secure to rehire this measure is important  because it lags the cycle on both the way down and the way up      Inventory sales ratio Because inventories accumulate as sales initially decline and then  once a business adjusts its ordering become depleted as sales pick up  this ratio tends to lag the cycle   Because businesses are slow to fire workers these costs tend to rise  into the early stages of recession as the existing labor force is used  less intensely  Late in the recovery when the labor market gets tight  upward pressure on wages can also raise such costs  In both cases  there is a clear lag at cyclical turns

2,281,Lagging    Average bank prime  lending rate
3,281,Because this is a bank administered rate it tends to lag other rates  that move either before cyclical turns or with them 
4,281,   Commercial and  industrial loans  outstanding
5,281,Because these loans frequently support inventory building they lag  the cycle for much the same reason that the inventory sales ratio  does 
6,281,   Ratio of consumer  installment debt to  income
7,281,   Change in consumer  price index for  services
8,281,Because consumers only borrow heavily when confident this  measure lags the cyclical upturn but debt also overstays cyclical  downturns because households have trouble adjusting to income  losses causing it to lag in the downturn   Inflation generally adjusts to the cycle late especially the more stable  services area 
9,281,a A diffusion index usually measures the percentage of components in a series that are rising in the same period  It  indicates how widespread a particular movement in the trend is among the individual components 
10,281,Let us consider a few examples that show the use of these statistics in identifying a business cycle phase  An  increase in the reported ratio of consumer installment debt to income lags  occurs after  cyclical upturns  so the  increase by itself would be evidence that an upturn has been underway  That could confirm the implication of  positive changes in coincident indicators that an expansion is in place  As a leading economic indicator a  positive change in the S P     Index is supposed to lead  come before  an increase in aggregate economic  activity  An increase in the S P     would be positive for future economic growth all else equal  However if  the S P     showed an increase but the aggregate index did not we would likely not draw a positive  conclusion  For a final example if we observed that the LEI moved up a small amount on two consecutive  observations we might conclude that a modest economic expansion is expected 
11,281,The component indicators for other countries though different in specifics are similar in most respects  The  Eurozone for instance composes its leading index from eight components 
12,281,   Economic sentiment index
13,281,   Residential building permits
14,281,   Capital goods orders
15,281,   The Euro Stoxx Equity Index
16,281,   M  money supply
17,281,   An interest rate spread
18,281,   Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index
19,281,   Eurozone Service Sector Future Business Activity Expectations Index
20,281,The parallels between many of these components and those used in the United States are clear but Europe has a  services component in its business activity measures that the United States lacks whereas Europe forgoes many  of the overtime and employment gauges that the United States includes 
21,281,Japan s leading index contains    components 
22,281,   New orders for machinery and construction equipment
23,281,   Real operating profits
24,281,   Overtime worked

9,282,Again many are similar but Japan includes labor market indicators more like the United States than Europe and  adds a measure of business failures not included in the other two 
10,282,Similarities and differences along these lines appear in indicators for the United Kingdom Australia South  Africa specific European economies and other countries  The general tone is however similar to the detail  provided here for the United States 
11,282,Building Permits as a Leading Economic Indicator
12,282,Exhibit   shows an example of a leading economic indicator in Germany the granted building permits  along with its relationship to the growth of Germany s GDP  In Exhibit   the growth rate of building  permits usually peaks one quarter ahead of the GDP growth rate with the exception for the first half of       and       Before      the growth rate of building permits usually bottomed out earlier than the  GDP growth rate by four quarters  But after      the troughs of the two series almost coincide  The  uncertainty of the relationships between an indicator and business cycles is very common  Some  indicators may be good predictors for economic expansions but poor predictors for recessions  This  uncertainty is why economists and statisticians often combine different indicators and try to find  common factors among them when building indicator indexes

2,283,Diffusion Index of Economic Indicators
3,283,In the United States the Conference Board also compiles a monthly diffusion index of the leading  lagging and coincident indicators  The diffusion index reflects the proportion of the index s  components that are moving in a pattern consistent with the overall index  Analysts often rely on these  diffusion indexes to provide a measure of the breadth of the change in a composite index 
4,283,For example the Conference Board tracks the growth of each of the    constituents of its leading  indicator measure assigning a value of     to each indicator that rises by more than       during the  monthly measurement period a value of     for each component indicator that changes by less than        and a value of   for each component indicator that falls by more than        These assigned  values which of course differ in other indexes in other countries are then summed and divided by      the number of components   Then to make the overall measure resemble the more familiar indexes the  Board multiplies the result by     
5,283,A simple numerical example will help explain  Say for ease of exposition the indicator has only four  component parts  stock prices money growth orders and consumer confidence  In one month stock  prices rise      money growth rises      orders are flat and consumer confidence falls by        Using the Conference Board s assigned values these would contribute respectively                       to create a numerator of      When divided by four  the number of components  and multiplied by     it  generates an indicator of      for that month 
6,283,Assume that the following month stock prices fall      money grows by      orders pick up       and consumer confidence grows       Applying the appropriate values the components would add to                             Divided by the number of components and multiplied by     this yields an  index value of     The       increase in the index value means more components of the composite  index are rising  Given this result an analyst can be more confident that the higher composite index  value actually represents broader movements in the economy  In general a diffusion index does not  reflect outliers in any component  like a straight arithmetic mean would do  but instead tries to capture  the overall change common to all components 
7,283,     Other Variables Used as Economic Indicators
8,283,In addition to this array of measures public agencies and trade associations provide aggregate cyclical  measures  These may include surveys of industrialists bankers labor associations and households on the state  of their finances level of activity and their confidence in the future  In the United States for instance the  Federal Reserve polls its    branches for a qualitative report on business activity and expectations in their  respective regions  It summarizes those findings in what it calls the  Beige Book  released every   weeks  Also  in the United States the Institute of Supply Management  ISM  polls its members to build indexes of  manufacturing orders output employment pricing and comparable gauges for services  Over the last decade  so called  purchasing managers  indexes along the lines of the ISM have been introduced in a wide range of  countries including Europe and China  Japan s industrial organization polls its members in a similar way and  releases the findings in what is called the  Tankan Report   These diverse sources multiply within and across  economies  Practitioners can use these sources to assess whether they confirm or contradict other more broad  based cyclical indicators giving pause to or greater confidence in those earlier conclusions

18,285,Solution to   
19,285,B is correct  The first three indicators are leading indicators and all of them are indicating an impending  recession which means the economy has reached the peak in this cycle  Non agricultural payrolls and  manufacturing and trade sales are coincident indicators  The trends in these two variables further indicate  that the economy may begin to decline  The trends in the last two indicators both lagging  indicators indicate that the economy may either continue to grow or it may be close to a peak   Aggregating the signals given by all three groups of economic indicators it appears the economy may be  near the peak of a business cycle 
20,285,Solution to   
21,285,C is correct  The indicator indexes are constantly updated for their composition and methodology based  on the accumulation of empirical knowledge and they can certainly include more than just leading  indicators 
22,285,Solution to   
23,285,C is correct  The improving leading indicator average weekly initial claims for unemployment  insurance and the improving coincident indicator aggregate real personal income are most consistent  with an economic recovery  Even though a declining inventory to sales ratio a lagging indicator is  consistent with an early recovery the coincident indicator the stable industrial production index does  not support that conclusion  Although a rising stock market index can signal economic expansion the  lagging indicator the unit labor costs has peaked which is more consistent with a recession

2,286,SUMMARY
3,286,This reading has summarized business cycle analysis  Among the points made are the following 
4,286,  Business cycles are a fundamental feature of market economies but their amplitude and length varies  considerably 
5,286,  Business cycles have four phases  trough expansion peak and contraction 
6,286,  Keynesian theories focus on fluctuations of aggregate demand  AD   If AD shifts left Keynesians  advocate government intervention to restore full employment and avoid a deflationary spiral  Monetarists  argue that the timing of government policies is uncertain and it is generally better to let the economy find  its new equilibrium unassisted but ensure that the money supply is kept growing at an even pace 
7,286,  New Classical and Real Business Cycle  RBC  theories also consider fluctuations of aggregate supply   AS   If AS shifts left because of an input price increase or right because of a price decrease or technical  progress the economy will gradually converge to its new equilibrium  Government intervention is  generally not necessary because it may exacerbate the fluctuation or delay the convergence to equilibrium   New Keynesians argue that frictions in the economy may prevent convergence and government policies  may be needed 
8,286,  The demand for factors of production may change in the short run as a result of changes in all components  of GDP  consumption  e g  households worry about the future save more and thus shift AD left   investment  e g  companies expect customers to increase demand and buy new equipment thus shifting  AD right  another example is that companies introduce new technologies thus shifting long term AS  right  government  e g  fiscal and monetary policies shift AD  and net exports  e g  faster growth in  other countries generates higher demand for the home country s products thus shifting AD or higher  prices of imported inputs shift AS left   Any shifts in AD and AS will affect the demand for the factors of  production  capital and labor  that are used to produce the new level of GDP 
9,286,  Unemployment has different subcategories  Frictional  people that are not working because they are in  between jobs   structural  people that are unemployed because they do not have the skills required by the  openings or reside far away from the jobs   discouraged workers are unemployed people who have given  up looking for jobs because they do not believe they can find one  they are considered outside the labor  force in unemployment statistics   and voluntarily unemployed are people who do not wish to work for  example because they are in school retired early or very rich  they are also considered outside the labor  force in unemployment statistics  
10,286,  There are different types of inflation  Hyperinflation indicates a high  e g       annual  and increasing  rate of inflation  deflation indicates a negative inflation rate  prices decrease   imported inflation is  associated with increasing cost of inputs that come from abroad  demand inflation is caused by constraints  in production that prevent companies from making as many goods as the market demands  it is sometimes  called wartime inflation because in times of war goods tend to be rationed  
11,286,  Economic indicators are statistics on macroeconomic variables that help in understanding which stage of  the business cycle an economy is at  Of particular importance are the leading indicators which suggest  where the economy is likely to be in the near future  No economic indicator is perfect and many of these  statistics are subject to periodic revisions 
12,286,  Price levels are affected by real factors and monetary factors  Real factors include aggregate supply  an  increase in supply leads to lower prices  and aggregate demand  an increase in demand leads to higher  prices   Monetary factors include the supply of money  more money circulating if the economy is in  equilibrium will lead to higher prices  and the velocity of money  higher velocity if the economy is in  equilibrium will lead to higher prices

2,287,  Inflation is measured by many indexes  Consumer price indexes reflect the prices of a basket of goods and  services that is typically purchased by a normal household  Producer price indexes measure the cost of a  basket of raw materials intermediate inputs and finished products  GDP deflators measure the price of  the basket of goods and services produced within an economy in a given year  Core indexes exclude  volatile items such as agricultural products and energy whose prices tend to vary more than other goods

12,292,C  index of food and energy prices 
13,292,    What is the most important effect of labor productivity in a cost push inflation scenario

15,292,B  The productivity level determines the economy s status relative to its  natural rate of  unemployment  
16,292,C  As productivity growth proportionately exceeds wage increases product price increases are less  likely 
17,292,    Which of the following statements is the best description of the characteristics of economic indicators 
18,292,A  Leading indicators are important because they track the entire economy 
19,292,B  Lagging indicators in measuring past conditions do not require revisions 
20,292,C  A combination of leading and coincident indicators can offer effective forecasts 
21,292,    A product is part of a price index based on a fixed consumption basket  If over time the product s quality  improves while its price stays constant the measured inflation rate is most likely

4,293,A  Industrial capacity utilization rises to a very high level 
5,293,B  Labor productivity increases faster than hourly labor costs 
6,293,C  A shortage of trained workers emerges throughout the economy 
7,293,    An economist expects the following 
8,293,  The decline in the unemployment rate will result in higher revenues for home retailers 
9,293,  A tighter labor market will put upward pressure on wages compelling home retailers to raise prices

11,293,A  Stagflation
12,293,B  Cost push inflation
13,293,C  Demand pull inflation
14,293,    If relative to prior values of their respective indicators the inventory sales ratio has risen unit labor cost  is stable and real personal income has decreased it is most likely that a peak in the business cycle 
15,293,A  has occurred 
16,293,B  is just about to occur 
17,293,C  will occur sometime into the future 
18,293,    Current economic statistics indicating little change in services inflation rising residential building  permits and increasing average duration of unemployment are best interpreted as 
19,293,A  conflicting evidence about the direction of economy 
20,293,B  evidence that a cyclical upturn is expected to occur in the future 
21,293,C  evidence that a cyclical downturn is expected to occur in the future 
22,293,    When aggregate real personal income industrial output and the S P     Index all increase in a given  period it is most accurate to conclude that a cyclical upturn is 
23,293,A  occurring 
24,293,B  about to end

3,294,SOLUTIONS
4,294,   B is correct  The stages of the business cycle occur repeatedly over time 
5,294,   B is correct  The net trend during contraction is negative 
6,294,   A is correct  Inflation is rising at peaks 
7,294,   C is correct  At the end of a recession firms will run  lean production  to generate maximum output with  the fewest number of workers 
8,294,   C is correct  When an economy s expansion is well established businesses often have difficulty finding  qualified workers 
9,294,   A is correct  Accelerating inflation and rapidly expanding capital expenditures typically characterize the  peak of the business cycle  During such times many businesses finance their capital expenditures with  debt to expand their production capacity 
10,294,   B is correct  Physical capital adjustments to downturns come through aging of equipment plus lack of  maintenance 
11,294,   C is correct  Near the top of a cycle sales begin to slow before production is cut leading to an increase in  inventories relative to sales 
12,294,   A is correct  Austrian economists see monetary policy mistakes as leading to booms and busts 
13,294,    C is correct  When a nation s currency depreciates domestic goods seem cheaper than foreign goods  placing downward pressure on demand for imports  When the depreciation persists for some time the  country s total imports are likely to decrease 
14,294,    A is correct  Monetarists caution policy effects can occur long after the need for which they were  implemented is no longer an issue 
15,294,    B is correct  Discouraged workers are defined as persons who have stopped looking for work and are  outside the labor force 
16,294,    A is correct  Austrian economists advocate limited government intervention in the economy  They advise  that the best thing to do in a recession is to allow the necessary market adjustment to take place 
17,294,    A is correct  Keynesian economics is based on government intervention in the form of fiscal policy  The  national government responds to the recession by using deficit spending to fund infrastructure projects 
18,294,    B is correct  Real Business Cycle models conclude that expansions and contractions of the economy are  responses to external shocks such as supply shocks arising from advances in technology or changes in the  relative prices of inputs  e g  energy prices   An increase in energy prices shifts short run aggregate  supply to the left resulting in higher prices and lower GDP 
19,294,    C is correct  This effect makes unemployment rise more slowly as recessions start and fall more slowly as  recoveries begin 
20,294,    B is correct  With inflation a fixed amount of money buys fewer goods and services thus reducing  purchasing power

2,295,    A is correct  Discouraged workers have given up seeking employment and are statistically outside the  labor force  Therefore an increase in discouraged workers will decrease the labor force and thus the labor  participation ratio which is the ratio of labor force to total working age population  Additionally an  increase in discouraged workers will decrease the unemployment rate because discouraged workers are  not counted in the official unemployment rate 
3,295,    C is correct  Disinflation is known as a reduction of inflation from a higher to lower but still above zero  level 
4,295,    B is correct  In an economic recovery new job seekers return to the labor force and because they seldom  find work immediately their return may initially raise the unemployment rate 
5,295,    C is correct  Frictionally unemployed people are not working at the time of the employment survey but  have recently left one job and are about to start another job  The frictionally unemployed have a job  waiting for them and are not      unemployed it is just that they have not started the new job yet   Although the treasury manager has left his current employment he has accepted a new position at another  firm starting in six months 
6,295,    B is correct  Deflation is connected to a vicious cycle of reduced spending and higher unemployment 
7,295,    A is correct  In hyperinflation consumers accelerate their spending to beat prices increases and money  circulates more rapidly 
8,295,    A is correct  The Laspeyres index is calculated with these inputs 
9,295,  November consumption bundle                          
10,295,  December consumption bundle

13,295,    A is correct  The Paasche index uses the current product mix of consumption combined with the variation  of prices  So for December its value is
14,295,                                                                     
15,295,    C is correct  This scenario is often referred to as stagflation  Here the economy is likely to be left to self  correct because no short term economic policy is thought to be effective 
16,295,    C is correct  Disinflation is a decline in the inflation rate for example from    to    
17,295,    C is correct  Central banks typically use consumer price indexes to monitor inflation and evaluate their  monetary policies 
18,295,    C is correct  The CPI is typically used for this purpose while the PPI is more closely connected to  business contracts 
19,295,    B is correct  The inflation rate calculated by using a constant consumption basket  the Laspeyres index  is      derived as follows

8,296,Inflation rate                                    
9,296,    A is correct  Core inflation is less volatile since it excludes food and energy prices and therefore will not  be as likely to lead to policy overreactions when serving as a target 
10,296,    C is correct  For productivity or output per hour the faster that it can grow the further that wages can rise  without putting pressure on business costs per unit of output 
11,296,    C is correct  While no single indicator is definitive a mix of them which can be affected by various  economic determinants can offer the strongest signal of performance 
12,296,    B is correct  As the quality of a product improves it satisfies people s needs and wants better  The  measured inflation rate is skewed higher than otherwise unless an adjustment is made for the increase in  the quality of the good  Even if the good s price had increased over time the improvements in quality  would still bias the measured inflation rate upward 
13,296,    A is correct  A price index of goods and services that excludes food and energy is used to calculate core  inflation  Policymakers often use core inflation when reading the trend in the economy and making  economic policies  The reason is because policymakers are trying to avoid overreaction to short term  fluctuations in prices as a result of short term changes in supply and demand 
14,296,    B is correct  The narrowing spread of this leading indicator foretells a drop in short term rates and a fall in  economic activity  The prime rate is a lagging indicator and typically moves after the economy turns 
15,296,    C is correct  Cost push inflation occurs when rising costs compel businesses to raise prices generally  A  shortage of trained workers leads to wage pressures and even if such shortages impact only certain  sectors of the economy the economy overall may experience inflationary pressure 
16,296,    B is correct  Cost push inflation refers to the situation in which rising costs usually wages compel  businesses to raise prices 
17,296,    A is correct  Both inventory sales and unit labor costs are lagging indicators that decline somewhat after a  peak  Real personal income is a coincident indicator that by its decline shows a slowdown in business  activity 
18,296,    B is correct  Rising building permits a leading indicator indicates that an upturn is expected to occur or  continue  Increasing average duration of unemployment a lagging indicator indicates that a downturn  has occurred whereas the lack of any change in services inflation also a lagging indicator is neither  negative nor positive for the direction of the economy  Taken together these statistics indicate that a  cyclical upturn may be expected to occur 
19,296,    A is correct  Aggregate real personal income and industrial output are coincident indicators whereas the  S P     is a leading indicator  An increase in aggregate personal income and industrial output signals  that an expansion is occurring whereas an increase in the S P     signals that an expansion will occur or  is expected to continue  Taken together these statistics indicate that a cyclical upturn is occurring 
20,296,    C is correct  Aggregate real personal income is a coincident indicator of the business cycle and the ratio of  consumer installment debt to income is a lagging indicator  Increases in the ratio of consumer installment  debt follows increases in average aggregate income during the typical business cycle

2,297,    C is correct  Leading economic indicators have turning points that usually precede those of the overall  economy  Average weekly hours manufacturing is a leading economic indicator  The Industrial  Production Index is a coincident economic indicator and the average bank prime lending rate is a lagging  economic indicator

8,297, Alan Greenspan Chairman of the US Federal Reserve at the time remarked in        Thus this vast increase in the market value of  asset claims is in part the indirect result of investors accepting lower compensation for risk  Such an increase in market value is too  often viewed by market participants as structural and permanent  To some extent those higher values may be reflecting the increased  flexibility and resilience of our economy  But what they perceive as newly abundant liquidity can readily disappear  Any onset of  increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and as a consequence lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt  that supported higher asset prices  This is the reason that history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low  risk premiums   Greenspan       
9,297, Markets may react differently to changes in interest rates and other tools of monetary policy  There is a long chain of events from the  time when interest rates are cut to when banks change the rates they charge clients to when a company sees that rates are lower and  thus decides to invest in new equipment to when the equipment is finally purchased  Therefore by the time these events all happen  the economy may be in expansion and the new investment may lead the economy to overheating 
10,297, See Plosser        and Romer        for an introduction to RBC models  Basically RBC models assume that economic agents are  fully rational and that markets function with no imperfection or friction  As a consequence any changes in monetary aggregates or  other monetary policies will promptly cause changes in price levels and other variables without affecting real GDP or employment 
11,297, Frictional unemployment arises not because of the lack of general job opportunities but from the fact that both employers and  potential employees need some time to find a good match between the job vacancy and the candidate s interests skills and location  preference and so on  The frictionally unemployed can be those people who quit their previous jobs voluntarily but have yet to find or  start a new job and new entrants to the labor force such as recent college graduates or re entrants such as formerly discouraged  workers who have started looking for but have yet to find a job

7,300,   INTRODUCTION
8,300,The economic decisions of households can have a significant impact on an economy  For  example a decision on the part of households to consume more and to save less can lead to an  increase in employment investment and ultimately profits  Equally the investment decisions  made by corporations can have an important impact on the real economy and on corporate  profits  But individual corporations can rarely affect large economies on their own  the  decisions of a single household concerning consumption will have a negligible impact on the  wider economy 
9,300,By contrast the decisions made by governments can have an enormous impact on even the  largest and most developed of economies for two main reasons  First the public sectors of most  developed economies normally employ a significant proportion of the population and they are  usually responsible for a significant proportion of spending in an economy  Second  governments are also the largest borrowers in world debt markets  Exhibit   gives some idea of  the scale of government borrowing and spending

2,302,Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the  quantity of money and credit in an economy   By contrast fiscal policy refers to the  government s decisions about taxation and spending  Both monetary and fiscal policies are used  to regulate economic activity over time  They can be used to accelerate growth when an  economy starts to slow or to moderate growth and activity when an economy starts to overheat   In addition fiscal policy can be used to redistribute income and wealth 
3,302,The overarching goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is normally the creation of an  economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low   Crucially the aim is therefore to steer the underlying economy so that it does not experience  economic booms that may be followed by extended periods of low or negative growth and high  levels of unemployment  In such a stable economic environment householders can feel secure  in their consumption and saving decisions while corporations can concentrate on their  investment decisions on making their regular coupon payments to their bond holders and on  making profits for their shareholders 
4,302,The challenges to achieving this overarching goal are many  Not only are economies frequently  buffeted by shocks  such as oil price jumps  but some economists believe that natural cycles in  the economy also exist  Moreover there are plenty of examples from history where government  policies either monetary fiscal or both have exacerbated an economic expansion that  eventually led to damaging consequences for the real economy for financial markets and for  investors 
5,302,The balance of the reading is organized as follows  Section   provides an introduction to  monetary policy and related topics  Section   presents fiscal policy  The interactions between  monetary policy and fiscal policy are the subject of Section    A summary and practice  problems conclude the reading 
6,302,   MONETARY POLICY
7,302,As stated above monetary policy refers to government or central bank activities that are  directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy  Before we can  begin to understand how monetary policy is implemented we must examine the functions and  role of money  We can then explore the special role that central banks play in today s  economies

3,303,C  seeks to influence the macro economy by influencing the quantity of money  and credit in the economy 
4,303,   Which of the following statements best describes fiscal policy  Fiscal policy 
5,303,A  is used by governments to redistribute wealth and incomes 
6,303,B  is the attempt by governments to balance their budgets from one year to the  next 
7,303,C  involves the use of government spending and taxation to influence economy  activity 
8,303,Solution to   
9,303,C is correct  Choice A is incorrect because although the setting of targets for monetary  aggregates is a possible tool of monetary policy monetary policy itself is concerned  with influencing the overall or macro economy 
10,303,Solution to   
11,303,C is correct  Note that governments may wish to use fiscal policy to redistribute incomes  and balance their budgets but the overriding goal of fiscal policy is usually to influence  a broader range of economic activity 
12,303,     Money
13,303,To understand the nature role and development of money in modern economies it is useful to  think about a world without money where to purchase any good or service an individual  would have to  pay  with another good or service  An economy where such economic agents as  households corporations and even governments pay for goods and services in this way is  known as a barter economy  There are many drawbacks to such an economy  First the  exchange of goods for other goods  or services  would require both economic agents in the  transaction to want what the other is selling  This means that there has to be a double  coincidence of wants  It might also be impossible to undertake transactions where the goods  are indivisible that is where one agent wishes to buy a certain amount of another s goods but  that agent only has one indivisible unit of another good that is worth more than the good that the  agent is trying to buy  Another problem occurs if economic agents do not wish to exchange all  of their goods on other goods and services  This may not be a problem however when the  goods they have to sell can be stored safely so that they retain their value for the future  But if  these goods are perishable they will not be able to store value for their owner  Finally in a  barter economy there are many measures of value  the price of oranges in terms of pears  of  pears in terms of bread  of bread in terms of milk  or of milk in terms of oranges  A barter  economy has no common measure of value that would make multiple transactions simple

1,304,    yang lu  yolandalulu outlook com                                                 
2,304,       The Functions of Money
3,304,The most generic definition of money is that it is any generally accepted medium of exchange   A medium of exchange is any asset that can be used to purchase goods and services or to  repay debts  Money can thus eliminate the debilitating double coincidence of the  wants   problem that exists in a barter economy  When this medium of exchange exists a farmer  wishing to sell wheat for wine does not need to identify a wine producer in search of wheat   Instead he can sell wheat to those who want wheat in exchange for money  The farmer can then  exchange this money for wine with a wine producer who in turn can exchange that money for  the goods or services that she wants 
4,304,However for money to act as this liberating medium of exchange it must possess certain  qualities  It must 
5,304,i  be readily acceptable
6,304,ii  have a known value
7,304,iii  be easily divisible
8,304,iv  have a high value relative to its weight and
9,304,v  be difficult to counterfeit 
10,304,Qualities  i  and  ii  are closely related  the medium of exchange will only be acceptable if it  has a known value  If the medium of exchange has quality  iii  then it can be used to purchase  items of relatively little value and of relatively large value with equal ease  Having a high value  relative to its weight is a practical convenience meaning that people can carry around sufficient  wealth for their transaction needs  Finally if the medium of exchange can be counterfeited  easily then it would soon cease to have a value and would not be readily acceptable as a means  of effecting transactions  in other words it would not satisfy qualities  i  and  ii  
11,304,Given the qualities that money needs to have it is clear why precious metals  particularly gold  and silver  often fulfilled the role of medium of exchange in early societies and as recently as  the early part of the twentieth century  Precious metals were acceptable as a medium of  exchange because they had a known value were easily divisible had a high value relative to  their weight and could not be easily counterfeited 
12,304,Thus precious metals were capable of acting as a medium of exchange  But they also fulfilled  two other useful functions that are essential for the characteristics of money  In a barter  economy it is difficult to store wealth from one year to the next when one s produce is  perishable or indeed if it requires large warehouses in which to store it  Because precious  metals like gold had a high value relative to their bulk and were not perishable they could act  as a store of wealth  However their ability to act as a store of wealth not only depended on the  fact that they did not perish physically over time but also on the belief that others would always  value precious metals  The value from year to year of precious metals depended on people s  continued demand for them in ornaments jewellery and so on  For example people were  willing to use gold as a store of wealth because they believed that it would remain highly  valued  However if gold became less valuable to people relative to other goods and services  year after year it would not be able to fulfill its role as a store of value and as such might also  lose its status as a medium of exchange

2,305,Another important characteristic of money is that it can be used as a universal unit of account   As such it can create a single unitary measure of value for all goods and services  In an  economy where gold and silver are the accepted medium of exchange all prices debts and  wealth can be recorded in terms of their gold or silver coin exchange value  Money in its role  as a unit of account drastically reduces the number of prices in an economy compared to barter  which requires that prices be established for a good in terms of all other goods for which it  might be exchanged 
3,305,In summary money fulfills three important functions it 
4,305,  acts as a medium of exchange 
5,305,  provides individuals with a way of storing wealth  and
6,305,  provides society with a convenient measure of value and unit of account 
7,305,       Paper Money and the Money Creation Process
8,305,Although precious metals like gold and silver fulfilled the required functions of money  relatively well for many years and although carrying gold coins around was easier than  carrying around one s physical produce it was not necessarily a safe way to conduct business 
9,305,A crucial development in the history of money was the promissory note  The process began  when individuals began leaving their excess gold with goldsmiths who would look after it for  them  In turn the goldsmiths would give the depositors a receipt stating how much gold they  had deposited  Eventually these receipts were traded directly for goods and services rather than  there being a physical transfer of gold from the goods buyer to the goods seller  Of course both  the buyer and seller had to trust the goldsmith because the goldsmith had all the gold and the  goldsmith s customers had only pieces of paper  These depository receipts represented a  promise to pay a certain amount of gold on demand  This paper money therefore became a  proxy for the precious metals on which they were based that is they were directly related to a  physical commodity  Many of these early goldsmiths evolved into banks taking in excess  wealth and in turn issuing promissory notes that could be used in commerce 
10,305,In taking in other people s gold and issuing depository receipts and later promissory notes it  became clear to the goldsmiths and early banks that not all the gold that they held in their vaults  would be withdrawn at any one time  Individuals were willing to buy and sell goods and  services with the promissory notes but the majority of the gold that backed the notes just sat in  the vaults although its ownership would change with the flow of commerce over time  A  certain proportion of the gold that was not being withdrawn and used directly for commerce  could therefore be lent to others at a rate of interest  By doing this the early banks created  money 
11,305,The process of money creation is a crucial concept for understanding the role that money  plays in an economy  Its potency depends on the amount of money that banks keep in reserve to  meet the withdrawals of its customers  This practice of lending customers  money to others on  the assumption that not all customers will want all of their money back at any one time is
12,305,known as fractional reserve banking

2,306,We can illustrate how it works through a simple example  Suppose that the bankers in an  economy come to the view that they need to retain only    percent of any money deposited with  them  This is known as the reserve requirement   Now consider what happens when a  customer deposits      in the First Bank of Nations  This deposit changes the balance sheet of  First Bank of Nations as shown in Exhibit   and it represents a liability to the bank because it  is effectively loaned to the bank by the customer  By lending    percent of this deposit to  another customer the bank has two types of assets      the bank s reserves of     and     the  loan equivalent to      Notice that the balance sheet still balances       worth of assets and       worth of liabilities are on the balance sheet 
3,306,Now suppose that the recipient of the loan of     uses this money to purchase some goods of  this value and the seller of the goods deposits this     in another bank the Second Bank of  Nations  The Second Bank of Nations goes through the same process  it retains    in reserve  and loans    percent of the deposit       to another customer  This customer in turn spends      on some goods or services  The recipient of this money deposits it at the Third Bank of Nations  and so on  This example shows how money is created when a bank makes a loan 
4,306,Exhibit    Money Creation via Fractional Reserve Banking
5,306,First Bank of Nations Assets Liabilities Reserves     Deposits      Loans    
6,306,Second Bank of Nations Assets Liabilities Reserves    Deposits     Loans    
7,306,Third Bank of Nations Assets Liabilities Reserves      Deposits     Loans      
8,306,This process continues until there is no more money left to be deposited and loaned out  The  total amount of money  created  from this one deposit of      can be calculated as

2,307,It is the sum of all the deposits now in the banking system  You should also note that the  original deposit of      via the practice of reserve banking was the catalyst for       worth  of economic transactions  That is not to say that economic growth would be zero without this  process but instead that it can be an important component in economic activity 
3,307,The amount of money that the banking system creates through the practice of fractional reserve  banking is a function of   divided by the reserve requirement a quantity known as the money  multiplier   In the case just examined the money multiplier is              Equation   implies  that the smaller the reserve requirement the greater the money multiplier effect 
4,307,In our simplistic example we assumed that the banks themselves set their own reserve  requirements  However in some economies the central bank sets the reserve requirement  which is a potential means of affecting money growth  In any case a prudent bank would be  wise to have sufficient reserves such that the withdrawal demands of their depositors can be met  in stressful economic and credit market conditions 
5,307,Later when we discuss central banks and central bank policy we will see how central banks  can use the mechanism just described to affect the money supply  Specifically the central bank  could by purchasing      in government securities credited to the bank account of the seller  seek to initiate an increase in the money supply  The central bank may also lend reserves  directly to banks creating excess reserves  relative to any imposed or self imposed reserve  requirement  that can support new loans and money expansion

8,308,       Definitions of Money
9,308,The process of money creation raises a fundamental issue  What is money  In an economy with  money but without promissory notes and fractional reserve banking money is relatively easy to  define  Money is the total amount of gold and silver coins in circulation or their equivalent   The money creation process above however indicates that a broader definition of money might  encompass all the notes and coins in circulation plus all bank deposits 
10,308,More generally we might define money as any medium that can be used to purchase goods and  services  Notes and coins can be used to fulfill this purpose and yet such currency is not the  only means of purchasing goods and services  Personal cheques can be written based on a bank  chequing account while debit cards can be used for the same purpose  But what about time  deposits or savings accounts  Nowadays transfers can be made relatively easily from a savings  account to a current account  therefore these savings accounts might also be considered as part  of the stock of money  Credit cards are also used to pay for goods and services  however there  is an important difference between credit card payments and those made by cheques and debit  cards  Unlike a cheque or debit card payment a credit card payment involves a deferred  payment  Basically the greater the complexity of any financial system the harder it is to define  money 
11,308,The monetary authorities in most modern economies produce a range of measures of money   see Exhibit     But generally speaking the money stock consists of notes and coins in  circulation plus the deposits in banks and other financial institutions that can be readily used to  make purchases of goods and services in the economy  In this regard economists often speak of  the rate of growth of narrow money and or broad money  By narrow money they generally  mean the notes and coins in circulation in an economy plus other very highly liquid deposits   Broad money encompasses narrow money but also includes the entire range of liquid assets that  can be used to make purchases 
12,308,Because financial systems practice and institutions vary from economy to economy so do  definitions of money  thus it is difficult to make international comparisons  Still most central  banks produce both a narrow and broad measure of money plus some intermediate ones too   Exhibit   shows the money definitions in four economies

2,309,Exhibit    Definitions of Money
3,309,Money Measures in the United States
4,309,The US Federal Reserve produces two measures of money  The first is M  which  comprises notes and coins in circulation travelers  cheques of non bank issuers  demand deposits at commercial banks plus other deposits on which cheques can be  written  M  is the broadest measure of money currently produced by the Federal  Reserve and includes M  plus savings and money market deposits time deposit  accounts of less than         plus other balances in retail money market and mutual  funds 
5,309,Money Measures in the Eurozone
6,309,The European Central Bank  ECB  produces three measures of euro area money  supply  The narrowest is M   M  comprises notes and coins in circulation plus all  overnight deposits  M  is a broader definition of euro area money that includes M   plus deposits redeemable with notice up to three months and deposits with maturity  up to two years  Finally the euro area s broadest definition of money is M  which  includes M  plus repurchase agreements money market fund units and debt  securities with up to two years maturity 
7,309,Money Measures in Japan
8,309,The Bank of Japan calculates three measures of money  M  is the narrowest measure  and consists of cash currency in circulation  M  incorporates M  but also includes  certificates of deposit  CDs   The broadest measure M  incorporates M  plus  deposits held at post offices plus other savings and deposits with financial  institutions  There is also a  broad measure of liquidity  that encompasses M  as well  as a range of other liquid assets such as government bonds and commercial paper 
9,309,Money Measures in the United Kingdom
10,309,The United Kingdom produces a set of four measures of the money stock  M  is the  narrowest measure and comprises notes and coins held outside the Bank of England  plus Bankers  deposits at the Bank of England  M  includes M  plus  effectively  all  retail bank deposits  M  includes M  plus wholesale bank and building society  deposits and also certificates of deposit  Finally the Bank of England produces  another measure called M H which is a measure created to be comparable with  money definitions in the EU  see above   M H includes M  plus UK residents  and  corporations  foreign currency deposits in banks and building societies 
11,309,       The Quantity Theory of Money
12,309,The previous section of this reading shows that there are many definitions of money  In this  section we explore the important relationship between money and the price level  This  relationship is best expressed in the quantity theory of money which asserts that total  spending  in money terms  is proportional to the quantity of money  The theory can be  explained in terms of Equation   known as the quantity equation of exchange

2,310,Equation    
3,310,M   V   P   Y
4,310,where M is the quantity of money V is the velocity of circulation of money  the average  number of times in a given period that a unit of currency changes hands  P is the average price  level and Y is real output  The expression is really just an accounting identity  Effectively it  says that over a given period the amount of money used to purchase all goods and services in  an economy M   V is equal to monetary value of this output P   Y  If the velocity of money is  approximately constant which is an assumption of quantity theory then spending P   Y is  approximately proportional to M  The quantity equation can also be used to explain a  consequence of money neutrality  If money neutrality holds then an increase in the money  supply M will not affect Y real output or the speed with which money changed hands V  because if real output is unaffected there would be no need for money to change hands more  rapidly   However it will cause the aggregate price level P to rise 
5,310,The simple quantity theory gave rise to the equally simple idea that the price level or at least  the rate of inflation could be controlled by manipulating the rate of growth of the money  supply  Economists who believe this are referred to as monetarists  They argue that there is a  causal relationship running from money growth to inflation  In the past some governments  have tried to apply this logic in their efforts to control inflation most notably and  unsuccessfully the United Kingdom s government in       see Example     However it is  possible that causality runs the other way that is from real activity to the money supply  This  means that the quantity of money in circulation is determined by the level of economic activity  rather than vice versa 
6,310,       The Demand for Money
7,310,The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of money as  opposed to bonds or equities is known as the demand for money  There are three basic  motives for holding money 
8,310,  transactions related 
9,310,  precautionary  and
10,310,  speculative 
11,310,Money balances that are held to finance transactions are referred to as transactions money  balances  The size of the transactions balances will tend to increase with the average value of  transactions in an economy  Generally speaking as gross domestic product  GDP  grows over  time transactions balances will also tend to grow  however the ratio of transactions balances to  GDP remains fairly stable over time 
12,310,As the name suggests precautionary money balances are held to provide a buffer against  unforeseen events that might require money  These balances will tend to be larger for  individuals or organizations that enter into a high level of transactions over time  In other  words a precautionary buffer of      for a company that regularly enters into transactions  worth millions of dollars might be considered rather small  When we extend this logic to the  overall economy we can see that these precautionary balances will also tend to rise with the  volume and value of transactions in the economy and therefore GDP as well

2,311,Finally the speculative demand for money  sometimes called the portfolio demand for
3,311,money  relates to the demand to hold speculative money balances based on the potential  opportunities or risks that are inherent in other financial instruments  e g  bonds   Speculative  money balances consist of monies held in anticipation that other assets will decline in value   But in choosing to hold speculative money balances rather than bonds investors give up the  return that could be earned from the bond or other financial assets  Therefore the speculative  demand for money will tend to fall as the returns available on other financial assets rises   However it will tend to rise as the perceived risk in other financial instruments rises  In  equilibrium individuals will tend to increase their holdings of money relative to riskier assets  until the marginal benefit of having a lower risk portfolio of wealth is equal to the marginal cost  of giving up a unit of expected return on these riskier assets  In aggregate then speculative  balances will tend to be inversely related to the expected return on other financial assets and  directly related to the perceived risk of other financial assets 
4,311,EXAMPLE  
5,311,Money
6,311,   The transactions demand for money refers to the demand to hold money 
7,311,A  as a buffer against unforeseen events 
8,311,B  to use in the purchase of goods and services 
9,311,C  based on the opportunity or risks available on other financial instruments 
10,311,   The speculative demand for money will tend to 
11,311,A  fall as the perceived risk on other assets rises 
12,311,B  rise as the expected returns on other assets fall 
13,311,C  be inversely related to the transactions demand for money 
14,311,   What is the difference between narrow and broad money  Broad money 
15,311,A  is limited to those liquid assets most commonly used to make purchases 
16,311,B  can be used to purchase a wider range of goods and services than narrow  money 
17,311,C  encompasses narrow money and refers to the stock of the entire range of  liquid assets that can be used to make purchases 
18,311,Solution to   
19,311,B is correct  The transactions demand for money refers to the amount of money that  economic agents wish to hold to pay for goods and services

2,312,Solution to   
3,312,B is correct  If the expected return on other assets falls then the opportunity cost of  holding money also falls and can in turn lead to an increase in the speculative demand  for money 
4,312,Solution to   
5,312,C is correct  This is the definition of broad money  Broad money encompasses narrow  money 
6,312,       The Supply and Demand for Money
7,312,We have now discussed definitions of money its relationship with the aggregate price level  and the demand for it  We now discuss the interaction between the supply of and demand for  money 
8,312,As with most other markets the supply of money and the demand to hold it will interact to  produce an equilibrium price for money  In this market the price of money is the nominal  interest rate that could be earned by lending it to others  Exhibit   shows the supply and demand  curves for money  The vertical scale represents the rate of interest  the horizontal scale plots the  quantity of nominal money in the economy  The supply curve  MS  is vertical because we  assume that there is a fixed nominal amount of money circulating at any one time  The demand  curve  MD  is downward sloping because as interest rates rise the speculative demand for  money falls  The supply and demand for money are both satisfied at an equilibrium interest rate  of I   I  is the rate of interest at which no excess money balances exist

2,313,To see why I  is the equilibrium rate of interest where there are no excess money balances  consider the following  If the interest rate on bonds were I  instead of I  there would be excess  supply of money  M    M    Economic agents would seek to buy bonds with their excess money  balances which would force the price of bonds up and the interest rate back down to I    Similarly if bonds offered a rate of interest I  there would be an excess demand for money  M   M    Corporations and individuals would seek to sell bonds so that individuals could increase  their money holdings but in doing so the price of bonds would fall and the interest rate offered  on them would rise until it reached I   Interest rates effectively adjust to bring the market into  equilibrium   clear the market    In this simple example we have also assumed that the supply  of money and bonds is fixed as economic agents readjust their holdings  In practice this may  not be true but the dynamics of the adjustment process described here essentially still hold 
3,313,Exhibit   also reemphasises the relationship between the supply of money and the aggregate  price level which we first encountered when discussing the quantity theory of money  Suppose  that the central bank increases the supply of money from M  to M  so that the vertical supply  curve shifts to the right  Because the increase in the supply of money makes it more plentiful  and hence less valuable its price  the interest rate  falls as the price level rises

2,314,This all sounds very simple but in practice the effects of an increase in the money supply are  more complex  The initial increase in the money supply will create excess supply of cash   People and companies could get rid of the excess by loaning the money to others by buying  bonds as implied above but they might also deposit it in a bank or simply use it to buy goods  and services  But an economy s capacity to produce goods and services depends on the  availability of real things  notably natural resources capital and labour that is factors of  production supplied either directly or indirectly by households  Increasing the money supply  does not change the availability of these real things  Thus some economists believe that the  long run impact of an exogenous increase in the supply of money is an increase in the aggregate  price level 
3,314,This phenomenon whereby an increase in the money supply is thought in the long run simply  to lead to an increase in the price level while leaving real variables like output and employment  unaffected is known as money neutrality  To see why in the long run money should have a  neutral effect on real things consider the following simple example 
4,314,Suppose the government declared today that  kg would henceforth be referred to as  kg and  that    kg would be referred to as  kg  In other words suppose that they halved the  value  of a  kilogram  Would anything real have changed  A  kg bag of sugar would not have changed  physically although it would be relabelled as a  kg bag of sugar  However there might be  some short run effects  confused people might buy too little sugar and some people might go  on crash diets  But ultimately people would adjust  In the long run the change wouldn t matter   There is a clear parallel here with the theory of money neutrality  Doubling the prices of  everything halving the value of a currency does not change anything real  This is because  like kilograms money is a unit of account  However halving the value of a currency could  affect real things in the short run 
5,314,There are two points worth making with regard to money neutrality  First although the simple  kilogram analogy above does suggest that money should not affect real things in the long run  as the British economist Keynes said   In the long run we are all dead   In practice it is very  difficult for economists to be sure that money neutrality holds in the long run  And second we  must assume that monetary authorities do believe that the money supply can affect real things in  the short run  If they did not then there would be almost no point to monetary policy 
6,314,       The Fisher Effect
7,314,The Fisher effect is directly related to the concept of money neutrality  Named after the  economist Irving Fisher the Fisher effect states that the real rate of interest in an economy is  stable over time so that changes in nominal interest rates are the result of changes in expected  inflation  Thus the nominal interest rate  Rnom  in an economy is the sum of the required real  rate of interest  Rreal  and the expected rate of inflation   e  over any given time horizon 
8,314,Equation    
9,314,Rnom   Rreal    e
10,314,According to money neutrality over the long term the money supply and or the growth rate in  money should not affect Rreal but will affect inflation and inflation expectations

2,315,The Fisher effect also demonstrates that embedded in every nominal interest rate is an  expectation of future inflation  Suppose that    month US government T bills offered a yield  equal to   percent over the year  Suppose also that T bill investors wished to earn a real rate of  interest of   percent and expected inflation to be   percent over the next year  In this case the  return of   percent would be sufficient to deliver the investors  desired real return of   percent   so long as inflation did not exceed   percent   Now suppose that investors changed their view  about future inflation and instead expected it to equal   percent over the next    months  To  compensate them for the higher expected inflation the T bill rate would have to rise to    percent thereby preserving the required   percent real return 
3,315,There is one caveat to this example  Investors can never be sure about future values of such  economic variables as inflation and real growth  To compensate them for this uncertainty they  require a risk premium  The greater the uncertainty the greater the required risk premium  So  all nominal interest rates are actually comprised of three components 
4,315,  a required real return 
5,315,  a component compensating investors for expected inflation  and
6,315,  a risk premium to compensate them for uncertainty 
7,315,EXAMPLE  
8,315,Interest Rates and the Supply of Money
9,315,   According to the quantity equation of exchange an increase in the money supply  can lead to an 
10,315,A  increase in the aggregate price level regardless of changes in the velocity of  circulation of money 
11,315,B  increase in the aggregate price level as long as the velocity of circulation of  money rises sufficiently to offset the increase in the money supply 
12,315,C  increase in the aggregate price level as long as the velocity of circulation of  money does not fall sufficiently to offset the increase in the money supply  and real output is unchanged 
13,315,   The nominal interest rate comprises a real rate of interest 
14,315,A  plus a risk premium only 
15,315,B  plus a premium for expected inflation only 
16,315,C  compensation for both expected inflation and risk 
17,315,   An expansion in the money supply would most likely 
18,315,A  lead to a decline in nominal interest rates 
19,315,B  lead to an increase in nominal interest rates

5,316,Solution to   
6,316,C is correct  Investors demand a real rate of interest and compensation for expected  inflation and a risk premium to compensate them for uncertainty

9,316,EXAMPLE  
10,316,Mrs  Thatcher s Monetary Experiment
11,316,The Background
12,316,Over the     s the United Kingdom had one of the worst inflation records of any  developed economy  Retail price inflation averaged      percent over that decade and  peaked at      percent in August       Over this period then Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher and her advisers had become convinced that inflation could not be controlled  by the income and price policies used in the United Kingdom in the past  Instead they  believed that inflation could be tamed by controlling the rate of growth of the money  supply  Mrs  Thatcher s first administration took power in May      with the intention  of pursuing a monetarist agenda that is a macroeconomic policy that would be  underpinned by targets for money supply growth 
13,316,The Medium Term Financial Strategy
14,316,Targets for monetary growth were set for a definition of the money supply known as  Sterling M    M   which was to be kept in the range of      percent for the period            and then gradually reduced to within     percent by            This set of  targets was known as the Medium Term Financial Strategy  MTFS   The idea was  simple  Control the rate of growth of the money supply and the rate of growth of prices   i e  inflation  would remain under control too  The instrument of control was the Bank  of England s policy interest rate that would be set to achieve the desired rate of growth  of the money supply  This was a macroeconomic policy built however imperfectly on  an interpretation of the quantity theory of money

2,317,The theory was simple but the practice proved to be less so  Over the first two and a  half years of the MTFS  M  overshot its target by     percent  The inability of the  monetary authorities to control the rate of growth of the broad money supply was largely  caused by Thatcher s abolition of exchange controls in       By abolishing these  controls there was a significant increase in foreign exchange business that came into the  British banking system which changed the velocity of money and therefore meant that  the relationship between broad money and nominal incomes had changed  fundamentally  
3,317,Despite the inability to control the money supply in      the Thatcher administration  reasserted its confidence in the policy and published a further set of monetary targets for  several years ahead  However the persistent failure to meet these targets too eventually  led to the abandonment of any type of monetary targeting by the summer of      
4,317,The experience of the UK monetary authorities over this period emphasizes how  unstable the relationship between money and the policy interest rate could be along with  the relationship between money and aggregate demand particularly in an economy that  is experiencing rapid financial innovation as the UK economy was following the  abolition of exchange controls and the introduction of greater competition within the  banking industry 
5,317,Today the Bank of England is responsible for the operation and implementation of  monetary policy in the United Kingdom  The trends in money supply are watched very  carefully but they are not the subject of targets per se 
6,317,     The Roles of Central Banks
7,317,Central banks play a number of key roles in modern economies  Generally a central bank is the  monopoly supplier of the currency the banker to the government and the bankers  bank the  lender of last resort the regulator and supervisor of the payments system the conductor of  monetary policy and the supervisor of the banking system  Let us examine these roles in turn 
8,317,In its earliest form money could be exchanged for a pre specified precious commodity usually  gold and promissory notes were issued by many private banks  Today however state owned  institutions usually central banks are designated in law as being the monopoly suppliers of a  currency  Initially these monopolists supplied money that could be converted into a pre  specified amount of gold  they adhered to a gold standard  For example up until      bank  notes issued by Britain s central bank the Bank of England could be redeemed at the bank for  a pre specified amount of gold  But Britain like most other major economies abandoned this  convertibility principle in the first half of the twentieth century  Money in all major economies  today is not convertible by law into anything else but it is in law legal tender  This means  that it must be accepted when offered in exchange for goods and services  Money that is not  convertible into any other commodity is known as fiat money  Fiat money derives its value via  government decree and because people accept it for payment of goods and services and for debt  repayment

2,318,As long as fiat money is acceptable to everyone as a medium of exchange and it holds its value  over time then it will also be able to serve as a unit of account  However once an economy has  moved to a system of fiat money the role of the supplier of that money becomes even more  crucial because they could for example expand the supply of this money indefinitely should  they wish to do so  Central banks therefore play a crucial role in modern economies as the  suppliers and guardians of the value of their fiat currencies and as institutions charged with the  role of maintaining confidence in their currencies  As the monopoly suppliers of an economy s  currency central banks are at the centre of economic life  As such they assume other roles in  addition to being the suppliers and guardians of the value of their currencies 
3,318,Most central banks act as the banker to the government and to other banks  They also act as a  lender of last resort to banks  Because the central bank effectively has the capacity to print  money it is in the position to be able to supply the funds to banks that are facing a damaging  shortage  The facts that economic agents know that the central bank stands ready to provide the  liquidity required by any of the banks under its jurisdiction and that they trust government bank  deposit insurance help to prevent bank runs in the first place  However the recent financial  crisis has shown that this knowledge is not always sufficient to deter a bank run

6,318,In the latter part of the summer of      the fall in US house prices and the related  implosion of the US sub prime mortgage market became the catalyst for a global  liquidity crisis  Banks began to hoard cash and refused to lend to other banks at anything  other than extremely punitive interest rates through the interbank market  This caused  severe difficulties for a UK mortgage bank Northern Rock  Northern Rock s mortgage  book had expanded rapidly in the preceding years as it borrowed aggressively from the  money markets  It is now clear that this expansion was at the expense of loan quality   The then UK regulatory authority the Financial Services Authority  FSA   later  reported in      that Northern Rock s lending practices did not pay due regard to either  the credit quality of the mortgagees or the values of the properties on which the  mortgages were secured  Being at the worst end of banking practice and relying heavily  on international capital markets for its funding Northern Rock was therefore very  susceptible to a global reduction in liquidity  As the liquidity crisis took hold Northern  Rock found that it could not replace its maturing money market borrowings  On     September      in desperate need of liquidity Northern Rock s board approached the  UK central bank to ask for the necessary funds 
7,318,However the news of Northern Rock s perilous liquidity position became known by the  public and more pertinently by Northern Rock s retail depositors  On    September  having heard the news queues began to form outside Northern Rock branches as  depositors tried to withdraw their savings  On that day it was estimated that Northern  Rock depositors withdrew around   bn representing   percent of Northern Rock s  deposits  Further panic ensued as investors in  internet only  Northern Rock accounts  could not withdraw their money because of the collapse of Northern Rock s website  A  further   bn was withdrawn over the next two days

2,319,Northern Rock s share price dropped rapidly as did the share prices of other similar UK  banks  The crisis therefore threatened to engulf more than one bank  To prevent  contagion the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on    September that the UK  government would guarantee all Northern Rock deposits  This announcement was  enough to stabilize the situation and given that lending to Northern Rock was now just  like lending to the government deposits actually started to rise again 
3,319,Eventually Northern Rock was nationalized by the UK government with the hope that  at some time in the future it could be privatized once its balance sheet had been repaired 
4,319,Central banks are also often charged by the government to supervise the banking system or at  least to supervise those banks that they license to accept deposits  However in some countries  this role is undertaken by a separate authority  In other countries the central bank can be jointly  responsible with another body for the supervision of its banks 
5,319,Exhibit   lists the banking supervisors in the G    countries  central banks are underlined  As  the exhibit shows most but not all bank systems have a single supervisor which is not  necessarily a central bank  A few countries such as Germany and the United States have more  than one supervisor

2,320,The United Kingdom is an interesting case study in this regard  Until May      the Bank of  England had statutory responsibility for banking supervision in the United Kingdom  In May       banking supervision was removed from the Bank of England and assigned to a new  agency the Financial Services Authority  FSA   However the removal of responsibility for  banking supervision from the central bank was seen by some as being a contributory factor in  the run on the mortgage bank Northern Rock and generally as a contributory factor in the  recent banking crisis  Because of this perceived weakness in the separation of the central bank  from banking supervision the Bank of England regained responsibility for banking supervision  and regulation in      
3,320,Perhaps the least appreciated role of a central bank is its role in the payments system  Central  banks are usually asked to oversee regulate and set standards for a country s payments system   Every day millions of financial transactions take place in a modern economy  For the system to  work properly procedures must be robust and standardized  The central bank will usually  oversee the payments system and will also be responsible for the successful introduction of any  new processes  Given the international nature of finance the central bank will also be  responsible for coordinating payments systems internationally with other central banks 
4,320,Most central banks will also be responsible for managing their country s foreign currency  reserves and also its gold reserves  With regard to the latter even though countries abandoned  the gold standard in the early part of the twentieth century the world s central bankers still hold  large quantities of gold  As such if central banks were to decide to sell significant proportions  of their gold reserves it could potentially depress gold prices 
5,320,Finally central banks are usually responsible for the operation of a country s monetary policy   This is arguably the highest profile role that these important organizations assume  Recall that  monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are directed toward influencing the  quantity of money and credit in an economy  As the monopoly supplier of a country s currency  central banks are in the ideal position to implement and or determine monetary policy 
6,320,To summarise central banks assume a range of roles and responsibilities  They do not all  assume responsibility for the supervision of the banks but all of the other roles listed below are  normally assumed by the central bank 
7,320,  Monopoly supplier of the currency 
8,320,  Banker to the government and the bankers  bank 
9,320,  Lender of last resort 
10,320,  Regulator and supervisor of the payments system

2,321,     The Objectives of Monetary Policy
3,321,Central banks fulfill a variety of important roles but for what overarching purpose  A brief  perusal of the websites of the world s central banks will reveal a wide range of explanations of  their objectives  Their objectives are clearly related to their roles and so there is frequent  mention of objectives related to the stability of the financial system and to the payments  systems  Some central banks are charged with doing all they can to maintain full employment  and output  But some also have related but less tangible roles like  maintaining confidence in  the financial system  or even to  promote understanding of the financial sector   But there is  one overarching objective that most seem to acknowledge explicitly and that is the objective of
4,321,maintaining price stability 
5,321,So although central banks usually have to perform many roles most specify an overarching  objective  Exhibit   lists what we might call the primary objective s  of a number of central  banks from both developed and developing economies 
6,321,Exhibit    The Objectives of Central Banks
7,321,The Central Bank of Brazil
8,321,Its  institutional mission  is to  ensure the stability of the currency s purchasing  power and a solid and efficient financial system  
9,321,The European Central Bank
10,321,  T o maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Euro system and of the  single monetary policy for which it is responsible  This is laid down in the Treaty on  the Functioning of the European Union Article          
11,321, Without prejudice to the objective of price stability  the euro system will also   support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing  to the achievement of the objectives of the Community   These include a  high level  of employment  and  sustainable and non inflationary growth  
12,321,The US Federal Reserve
13,321, The Federal Reserve sets the nation s monetary policy to promote the objectives of  maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates  
14,321,The Reserve Bank of Australia
15,321, It is the duty of the Reserve Bank Board within the limits of its powers to ensure  that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage  of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank     are exercised in such a  manner as in the opinion of the Reserve Bank Board will best contribute to 
16,321,a  the stability of the currency of Australia

9,322,B  banker to the government and banks 
10,322,C  body that sets tax rates on interest on savings 
11,322,   Which of the following best describes the overarching long run objective of most  central banks 
12,322,A  Price stability
13,322,B  Fast economic growth
14,322,C  Current account surplus
15,322,Solution to   
16,322,C is correct  A central bank is normally the lender of last resort and the banker to the  banks and government but the determination of all tax rates is normally the preserve of  the government and is a fiscal policy issue 
17,322,Solution to   
18,322,A is correct  Central banks normally have a variety of objectives but the overriding one  is nearly always price stability 
19,322,As we have already discussed one of the essential features of a monetary system is that the  medium of exchange should have a relatively stable value from one period to the next   Arguably then the overarching goal of most central banks in maintaining price stability is the  associated goal of controlling inflation  But before we explore the tools central banks use to  control inflation we should first consider the potential costs of inflation  In other words we  should ask why it is that central bankers believe that it is so important to control a nominal  variable

2,323,       The Costs of Inflation
3,323,Huge efforts have been put into controlling inflation since the major economies experienced  such high levels of inflation in the     s  From the early     s then inflation has been seen as  a very bad thing  But why  What are the costs of inflation  The debate around the  costs  of  inflation really centers on the distinction between expected inflation and unexpected  inflation  Expected inflation is clearly the level of inflation that economic agents expect in the  future  Unexpected inflation can be defined as the level of inflation that we experience that is  either below or above that which we expected  it is the component of inflation that is a surprise 
4,323,At a micro level high inflation means that businesses constantly have to change the advertised  prices of their goods and services  These are known as menu costs  There also exists what  economists refer to as  shoe leather  costs of inflation  In times of high inflation people would  naturally tend to hold less cash and would therefore wear out their shoe leather  or more likely  the engines of their cars  in making frequent trips to the bank to withdraw cash  But these are  relatively old arguments used to demonstrate that inflation is bad  In a modern economy with  the internet and with transactions becoming increasingly cashless these costs associated with  inflation will be lower today than they may have been in the past 
5,323,To demonstrate the potentially more significant costs of inflation consider the following   Imagine a world where inflation is high but where all prices  including asset prices  in an  economy are perfectly indexed to inflation and that technology has eliminated the issues  surrounding the menu and shoe leather costs of inflation  In such a world would economic  agents care about inflation  Probably not  If the average price of goods and services rose by     percent people s salaries  and all other prices  would rise by the same amount which would  therefore make economic agents indifferent to the rise in prices 
6,323,In practice however all prices wages salaries rents and so forth are not indexed in which  case economic agents would certainly need to think about inflation more carefully  But what if  inflation in this world where prices are no longer perfectly indexed is high but perfectly  predictable  In this alternative imaginary world economic agents would have to think about  inflation but not too hard as long as they were capable of calculating the impact of the known  inflation rate on all future prices  So if everyone knew that inflation was going to be    percent  over the next year then everyone could bargain for a    percent increase in their salaries to  accommodate this and companies could plan to put up the prices of their goods and services by     percent  Actually in this world an expectation of    percent inflation would become a self  fulfilling prophecy 
7,323,However economic agents would worry about inflation in a world where all prices were not  indexed and crucially where inflation was high and unpredictable  In fact this is a crude  description the inflationary backdrop in many developed economies over the     s and     s  including the United States France the United Kingdom Italy and Canada 
8,323,Arguably it is unexpected inflation that is most costly  Inflation that is fully anticipated can  be factored into wage negotiations and priced into business and financial contracts  But when  inflation turns out to be higher than is anticipated then borrowers benefit at the expense of  lenders because the real value of their borrowing declines  Conversely when inflation is lower  than is anticipated lenders benefit at the expense of borrowers because the real value of the  payment on debts rises  Furthermore if inflation is very uncertain or very volatile then lenders  will ask for a premium to compensate them for this uncertainty  As a result the costs of  borrowing will be higher than would otherwise have been the case  Higher borrowing costs  could in turn reduce economic activity for example by discouraging investment

2,324,It is also possible that inflation uncertainty can exacerbate the economic cycle  Inflation  uncertainty is the degree to which economic agents view future rates of inflation as hard to  forecast  Take for example the case of an imaginary television manufacturer  Suppose one day  that the manufacturer looks out at the market for televisions and sees that the market price of  televisions has risen by    percent  Armed with this information the manufacturer assumes that  there has been an increase in demand for televisions or maybe a reduction in supply  So to take  advantage of the new higher prices the manufacturer extends the factory employs more  workers and begins to produce more televisions 
3,324,Having now increased the output of the factory the manufacturer then attempts to sell the extra  televisions that the factory has produced  But to its horror the manufacturer finds out that there  is no extra demand for televisions  Instead the    percent rise in television prices was caused  by a generalized    percent increase in all consumer prices across the economy  The  manufacturer realizes that it has surplus stock surplus factory capacity and too many workers   So it cuts back on production lays off some of the workforce and realizes that it won t need to  invest in new plant or machinery for a long time 
4,324,This example emphasizes the potentially destabilizing impact of unexpected inflation  It  demonstrates how unanticipated inflation can reduce the information content of market prices  for economic agents  If we scale this example up it should not be too difficult to imagine how  unanticipated increases or decreases in the general price level could help to exacerbate and in  some extreme cases cause economic booms and busts 
5,324,Over the last two to three decades the consensus among economists has been that unanticipated  and high levels of inflation can have an impact on real things like employment investment and  profits and therefore that controlling inflation should be one of the main goals of  macroeconomic policy  In summary 
6,324,Expected inflation can give rise to 
7,324,  menu costs and
8,324,  shoe leather costs 
9,324,Unanticipated  unexpected  inflation can in addition 
10,324,  lead to inequitable transfers of wealth between borrowers and lenders  including losses to  savings  
11,324,  give rise to risk premia in borrowing rates and the prices of other assets  and
12,324,  reduce the information content of market prices 
13,324,       Monetary Policy Tools 
14,324,Central banks have three primary tools available to them  open market operations the  refinancing rate and reserve requirements 
15,324,http   e pub ffio jg  tfpropwkltz vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print            xht

2,325,         Open Market Operations
3,325,One of the most direct ways for a central bank to increase or reduce the amount of money in  circulation is via open market operations  Open market operations involve the purchase and  sale of government bonds from and to commercial banks and or designated market makers  For  example when the central bank buys government bonds from commercial banks this increases  the reserves of private sector banks on the asset side of their balance sheets  If banks then use  these surplus reserves by increasing lending to corporations and households then via the money  multiplier process explained in Section       broad money growth expands  Similarly the  central bank can sell government bonds to commercial banks  By doing this the reserves of  commercial banks decline reducing their capacity to make loans  i e  create credit  to  households and corporations and thus causing broad money growth to decline through the  money multiplier mechanism  In using open market operations the central bank may target a  desired level of commercial bank reserves or a desired interest rate for these reserves 
4,325,         The Central Bank s Policy Rate
5,325,The most obvious expression of a central bank s intentions and views comes via the interest rate
6,325,it sets  The name of the official interest rate  or official policy rate or just policy rate 
7,325,varies from central bank to central bank but its purpose is to influence short  and long term  interest rates and ultimately real economic activity 
8,325,The interest rate that a central bank sets and that it announces publicly is normally the rate at  which it is willing to lend money to the commercial banks  although practices do vary from  country to country   This policy rate can be achieved by using short term collateralized lending  rates known as repo rates  For example if the central bank wishes to increase the supply of  money it might buy bonds  usually government bonds  from the banks with an agreement to  sell them back at some time in the future  This transaction is known as a repurchase  agreement  Normally the maturity of repo agreements ranges from overnight to two weeks  In  effect this represents a secured loan to the banks and the lender  in this case the central bank   earns the repo rate 
9,325,Suppose that a central bank announces an increase in its official interest rate  Commercial banks  would normally increase their base rates at the same time  A commercial bank s base rate is  the reference rate on which it bases lending rates to all other customers  For example large  corporate clients might pay the base rate plus   percent on their borrowing from a bank while  the same bank might lend money to a small corporate client at the base rate plus   percent  But  why would commercial banks immediately increase their base or reference rates just because  the central bank s refinancing rate had increased 
10,325,The answer is that commercial banks would not want to have lent at a rate of interest that would  be lower than they might be charged by the central bank  Effectively the central bank can force  commercial banks to borrow from it at this rate because it can conduct open market operations  that create a shortage of money forcing the banks to sell bonds to it with a pre agreed  repurchase price  i e  do a repurchase agreement   The repo rate would be such that the central  bank earned the official refinancing rate on the transactions 
11,325,The name of each central bank s official refinancing rate varies  The Bank of England s  refinancing rate is the two week repo rate  In other words the Bank of England fixes the rate  at which it is willing to lend two week money to the banking sector  The ECB s official policy  rate is known as the refinancing rate and defines the rate at which it is willing to lend short  term money to the euro area banking sector

2,326,The corresponding rate in the United States is the discount rate which is the rate for member  banks borrowing directly from the Federal Reserve System  But the most important interest rate  used in US monetary policy is the federal funds rate  The federal funds rate  or fed funds  rate  is the interbank lending rate on overnight borrowings of reserves  The Federal Open  Market Committee  FOMC  seeks to move this rate to a target level by reducing or adding  reserves to the banking system by means of open market operations  The level of the rate is  reviewed by the FOMC at its meetings held every six weeks  although the target can be  changed between meetings if necessary  
3,326,Through the setting of a policy rate a central bank can manipulate the amount of money in the  money markets  Generally speaking the higher the policy rate the higher the potential penalty  that banks will have to pay to the central bank if they run short of liquidity the greater will be  their willingness to reduce lending and the more likely that broad money growth will shrink 
4,326,         Reserve Requirements
5,326,The third primary way in which central banks can limit or increase the supply of money in an  economy is via their reserve requirements  We have already seen that the money creation  process is more powerful the lower the percentage reserve requirement of banks  So a central  bank could restrict money creation by raising the reserve requirements of banks  However this  policy tool is not used much nowadays in developed economies  Indeed some central banks  such as the Bank of England do not even set minimum reserve requirements for the banks  under their jurisdiction anymore  Changing reserve requirements frequently is disruptive for  banks  For example if a central bank increased the reserve requirements a bank that was short  on reserves might have to cease its lending activities until it had built up the necessary reserves  because deposits would be unlikely to rise quickly enough for the bank to build its reserves in  this way  However reserve requirements are still actively used in many developing countries to  control lending for example in China and in India and they remain a potential policy tool for  those central banks that do not currently use it 
6,326,To summarize central banks can manipulate the money supply in one of three ways 
7,326,  open market operations 
8,326,  its official policy rate and associated actions in the repo market  and
9,326,  manipulation of official reserve requirements 
10,326,       The Transmission Mechanism
11,326,The overarching goal of a central bank is to maintain price stability  We demonstrated above  how a central bank can manipulate the money supply and growth of the money supply  We also  indicated how policy rates set and targeted by the central banks are usually very short term in  nature  often they target overnight interest rates  However most businesses and individuals in  the real economy borrow and lend over much longer time frames than this  It may not be  obvious then how changing short term interest rates can influence the real economy  particularly if money neutrality holds in the long run  The fact that central bankers believe that  they can affect real economic variables in particular economic growth by influencing broad  money growth suggests that they believe that money is not neutral at least not in the short run

3,327,Exhibit    A Stylized Representation of the Monetary Transmission  Mechanism
4,327,Source  Bank of England 
5,327,Suppose that a central bank announces an increase in its official interest rate  The  implementation of the policy may begin to work through the economy via four interrelated  channels  Those channels include bank lending rates asset prices agents  expectations and  exchange rates  First as described above the base rates of commercial banks and interbank  rates should rise in response to the increase in the official rate  Banks would in turn increase  the cost of borrowing for individuals and companies over both short  and long term horizons   Businesses and consumers would then tend to borrow less as interest rates rise  An increase in  short term interest rates could also cause the price of such assets as bonds or the value of capital  projects to fall as the discount rate for future cash flows rises 
6,327,Market participants would then come to the view that higher interest rates will lead to slower  economic growth reduced profits and reduced borrowing to finance asset purchases   Exporters  profits might decline if the rise in interest rates causes the country s exchange rate to  appreciate because this would make domestic exports more expensive to overseas buyers and  dampen demand to purchase them  The fall in asset prices as well as an increase in prices would  reduce household financial wealth and therefore lead to a reduction in consumption growth   Expectations regarding interest rates can play a significant role in the economy  Often  companies and individuals will make investment and purchasing decisions based on their  interest rate expectations extrapolated from recent events  If the central bank s interest rate  move is widely expected to be followed by other interest rate increases investors and  companies will act accordingly  Consumption borrowing and asset prices may all decline as a  result of the revision in expectations

2,328,There is a whole range of interconnected ways in which a rise in the central bank s policy rate  can reduce real domestic demand and net external demand  that is the difference between  export and import consumption   Weaker total demand would tend to put downward pressure on  the rate of domestic inflation as would a stronger currency which would reduce the prices of  imports  Taken together these might begin to put downward pressure on the overall measure of  inflation 
3,328,To summarize the central bank s policy rate works through the economy via any one and often  all of the following interconnected channels 
4,328,  Short term interest rates 
5,328,  Changes in the values of key asset prices

16,328,B  Import prices
17,328,C  Domestic inflation
18,328,Solution to   
19,328,C is correct  The price of equities for example might be affected by the expectation of  future policy interest rate changes  In other words a rate change may be taken as a  signal of the future stance of monetary policy contractionary or expansionary

3,329,A is correct  By setting its official interest rate a central bank could expect to have a  direct influence on inflation expectations as well as on other market interest rates  asset prices and the exchange rate  where this is freely floating   If it can influence these  factors it might ultimately hope to influence import prices  via changes in the exchange  rate  and also domestically generated inflation  via its impact on domestic and or  external demand   The problem is that the workings of the transmission  mechanism from the official interest rate to inflation are complex and can change  over time 
4,329,       Inflation Targeting
5,329,Over the     s a consensus began to build among both central bankers and politicians that the  best way to control inflation and thereby maintain price stability was to target a certain level of  inflation and to ensure that this target was met by monitoring a wide range of monetary  financial and real economic variables  Nowadays inflation targeting frameworks are the  cornerstone of monetary policy and macroeconomic policy in many economies  Exhibit   shows  the growth in the number of inflation targeting monetary policy regimes over time 
6,329,The inflation targeting framework that is now commonly practiced was pioneered in New  Zealand  In      the New Zealand Minister of Finance Roger Douglas announced that  economic policy would focus on bringing inflation down from the prevailing level of around      percent to a target range of   to   percent  This goal was given legal status by the Reserve  Bank of New Zealand Act       As part of the Act the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  RBNZ   was given the role of pursuing this target  The bank was given operational independence  it  was free to set interest rates in the way that it thought would best meet the inflation target   Although the RBNZ had independent control of monetary policy it was still accountable to the  government and was charged with communicating its decisions in a clear and transparent way   As Exhibit   shows the New Zealand model was widely copied

5,330,Although these inflation targeting regimes vary a little from economy to economy their success  is thought to depend on three key concepts  central bank independence credibility and  transparency 
6,330,Central Bank Independence 
7,330,In most cases the central bank that is charged with targeting inflation has a degree of  independence from its government  This independence is thought to be important  It is  conceivable that politicians could announce an inflation target and direct the central bank to set  interest rates accordingly  Indeed this was the process adopted in the United Kingdom between       and       But politicians have a constant eye on re election and might be tempted for  example to keep rates  too low  in the lead up to an election in the hope that this might help  their re election prospects  As a consequence this might lead to higher inflation  Thus it is now  widely believed that monetary policy decisions should rest in the hands of an organization that  is remote from the electoral process  The central bank is the natural candidate to be the  monopoly supplier of a currency 
8,330,However there are degrees of independence  For example the head of the central bank is nearly  always chosen by government officials  The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve s Board of  Governors is appointed by the President of the United States of America  the Head of the ECB  is chosen by the committee of Euro area finance ministers  while the Governor of the Bank of  England is chosen by the Chancellor of the Exchequer  So in practice separating control from  political influence completely is probably an impossible  although a desirable  goal 
9,330,There are further degrees of independence  Some central banks are both operationally and  target independent  This means that they not only decide the level of interest rates but they  also determine the definition of inflation that they target the rate of inflation that they target  and the horizon over which the target is to be achieved  The ECB has independence of this kind   By contrast other central banks including those in New Zealand Sweden and the United  Kingdom are tasked to hit a definition and level of inflation determined by the government   These central banks are therefore only operationally independent 
10,330,Credibility
11,330,The independence of the central bank and public confidence in it are key in the design of an  inflation targeting regime

2,331,To illustrate the role of credibility suppose that instead of the central bank the government  assumes the role of targeting inflation but the government is heavily indebted  Given that higher  inflation reduces the real value of debt the government would have an incentive to avoid  reaching the inflation target or to set a high inflation target such that price stability and  confidence in the currency could be endangered  As a result few would believe the government  was really intent on controlling inflation  thus the government would lack credibility  Many  governments have very large levels of debt especially since the           global financial  crisis  In such a situation economic agents might expect a high level of inflation regardless of  the actual stated target  The target might have little credibility if the organization s likelihood  of sticking to it is in doubt 
3,331,If a respected central bank assumes the inflation targeting role and if economic agents believe  that the central bank will hit its target the belief itself could become self fulfilling  If everyone  believes that the central bank will hit an inflation target of   percent next year this expectation  might be built into wage claims and other nominal contracts that would make it hit the   percent  target  It is for this reason that central bankers pay a great deal of attention to inflation  expectations  If these expectations were to rise rapidly perhaps following a rapid increase in oil  prices unchecked expectations could get embedded into wage claims and eventually cause  inflation to rise 
4,331,Transparency
5,331,One way of establishing credibility is for a central bank to be transparent in its decision making   Many if not all independent inflation targeting central banks produce a quarterly assessment of  their economies  These Inflation Reports as they are usually known give central banks   views on the range of indicators that they watch when they come to their  usually  monthly  interest rate decision  They will consider and outline their views on the following subjects  usually in this order 
6,331,  Broad money aggregates and credit conditions 
7,331,  Conditions in financial markets 
8,331,  Developments in the real economy  e g  the labour market   and
9,331,  Evolution of prices 
10,331,Consideration of all of these important components of an economy is then usually followed by a  forecast of growth and inflation over a medium term horizon usually two years 
11,331,By explaining their views on the economy and by being transparent in decision making the  independent inflation targeting central banks seek to gain reputation and credibility making it  easier to influence inflation expectations and hence ultimately easier to meet the inflation target 
12,331,The Target
13,331,Whether the target is set by the central bank or by the government for the central bank to hit the  level of the target and the horizon over which the target is to be hit is a crucial consideration in  all inflation targeting frameworks

9,332,Exhibit   shows that many central banks in developed economies target an inflation rate of    percent based on a consumer price index  Given that the operation of monetary policy is both  art and science the banks are normally allowed a range around the central target of    percent  or    percent  For example with a   percent target they would be tasked to keep inflation  between   percent and   percent  But why target   percent and not   percent 
10,332,The answer is that aiming to hit   percent could result in negative inflation known as  deflation  One of the limitations of monetary policy that we discuss below is its ability or  inability to deal with periods of deflation  If deflation is something to be avoided why not  target    percent  The answer to this question is that levels of inflation that high would not be  consistent with price stability  such a high inflation rate would further tend to be associated with  high inflation volatility and uncertainty  Central bankers seem to agree that   percent is far  enough away from the risks of deflation and low enough not to lead to destabilizing inflation  shocks 
11,332,Finally we should keep in mind that the headline inflation rate that is announced in most  economies every month and which is the central bank s target is a measure of how much a  basket of goods and services has risen over the previous twelve months  It is history   Furthermore interest rate changes made today will take some time to have their full effect on  the real economy as they make their way through the monetary transmission mechanism  It is  for these two reasons that inflation targeters do not target current inflation but instead usually  focus on inflation two years ahead 
12,332,Although inflation targeting mandates may vary from country to country they have common  elements  the specification of an explicit inflation target with permissible bounds and a  requirement that the central bank should be transparent in its objectives and policy actions  This  is all usually laid out in legislation that imposes statutory obligations on the central bank  As  mentioned earlier New Zealand pioneered the inflation targeting approach to monetary policy  that has since been copied widely  Below is New Zealand s Policy Targets Agreement which  specifies the inflation targeting mandate of its central bank the Reserve Bank of New Zealand

2,333,Exhibit     New Zealand s Policy Targets Agreement
3,333, This agreement between the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Reserve  Bank of New Zealand  the Bank  is made under section   of the Reserve Bank of  New Zealand Act       the Act   The Minister and the Governor agree as follows 
4,333,   Price stability
5,333,a  Under Section   of the Act the Reserve Bank is required to conduct  monetary policy with the goal of maintaining a stable general level of  prices 
6,333,b  The Government s economic objective is to promote a growing open and  competitive economy as the best means of delivering permanently higher  incomes and living standards for New Zealanders  Price stability plays an  important part in supporting this objective 
7,333,   Policy target
8,333,a  In pursuing the objective of a stable general level of prices the Bank  shall monitor prices as measured by a range of price indexes  The price  stability target will be defined in terms of the All Groups Consumers  Price Index  CPI  as published by Statistics New Zealand 
9,333,b  For the purpose of this agreement the policy target shall be to keep  future CPI inflation outcomes between   per cent and   per cent on  average over the medium term 
10,333,   Inflation variations around target
11,333,a  For a variety of reasons the actual annual rate of CPI inflation will vary  around the medium term trend of inflation which is the focus of the  policy target  Amongst these reasons there is a range of events whose  impact would normally be temporary  Such events include for example  shifts in the aggregate price level as a result of exceptional movements in  the prices of commodities traded in world markets changes in indirect  taxes  significant government policy changes that directly affect prices  or a natural disaster affecting a major part of the economy 
12,333,b  When disturbances of the kind described in clause   a  arise the Bank  will respond consistent with meeting its medium term target 
13,333,   Communication implementation and accountability
14,333,a  On occasions when the annual rate of inflation is outside the medium  term target range or when such occasions are projected the Bank shall  explain in Policy Statements made under section    of the Act why such  outcomes have occurred or are projected to occur and what measures it  has taken or proposes to take to ensure that inflation outcomes remain  consistent with the medium term target

2,334,b  In pursuing its price stability objective the Bank shall implement  monetary policy in a sustainable consistent and transparent manner and  shall seek to avoid unnecessary instability in output interest rates and the  exchange rate 
3,334,c  The Bank shall be fully accountable for its judgments and actions in  implementing monetary policy  
4,334,Source  http   www rbnz govt nz  
5,334,To summarize an inflation targeting framework normally has the following set of features 
6,334,  An independent and credible central bank 
7,334,  A commitment to transparency 
8,334,  A decision making framework that considers a wide range of economic and financial  market indicators  and
9,334,  A clear symmetric and forward looking medium term inflation target sufficiently above    percent to avoid the risk of deflation but low enough to ensure a significant degree of  price stability 
10,334,Indeed independence credibility and transparency are arguably the crucial ingredients for an  effective central bank whether they target inflation or not 
11,334,The Main Exceptions to the Inflation Targeting Rule
12,334,Although the practice of inflation targeting is widespread there are two prominent central banks  that have not adopted a formal inflation target along the lines of the New Zealand model  the  Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve System 
13,334,The Bank of Japan
14,334,Japan s central bank the Bank of Japan  BoJ  does not target an explicit measure of  inflation  Japan s government and its monetary authorities have been trying to combat  deflation for much of the last two decades  However despite their efforts including the  outright printing of money inflation has remained very weak  Inflation targeting is seen  very much as a way of combating and controlling inflation  as such it would seem to  have no place in an economy that suffers from persistent deflation 
15,334,Some economists have argued however that an inflation target is exactly what the  Japanese economy needs  By announcing that positive inflation of say   percent is desired  by the central bank this might become a self fulfilling prophecy if Japanese consumers  and companies factor this target into nominal wage and price contracts  But for economic  agents to believe that the target will be achieved they have to believe that the central  bank is capable of achieving it  Given that the BoJ has failed to engineer persistent  positive inflation it is debatable how much credibility Japanese households and  corporations would afford such an inflation targeting policy

2,335,The US Federal Reserve System
3,335,It is perhaps rather ironic that the world s most influential central bank the US Federal  Reserve which controls the supply of the world s de facto reserve currency the US  dollar does not have an explicit inflation target  However it is felt that the single minded  pursuit of inflation might not be compatible with the Fed s statutory goal as laid out in the  Federal Reserve Act which charges the Fed s board to 
4,335, promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and  moderate long term interest rates  
5,335,In other words it has been argued that inflation targeting might compromise the goal of   maximum employment   In practice however the Fed has indicated that it sees core  inflation measured by the personal consumption expenditure  PCE  deflator of about or  just below   percent as being compatible with  stable prices   Financial markets  therefore watch this US inflation gauge very carefully in order to try and anticipate the  rate actions of the Fed 
6,335,Monetary Policy in Developing Countries
7,335,Developing economies often face significant impediments to the successful operation of any  monetary policy that is the achievement of price stability  These include 
8,335,  the absence of a sufficiently liquid government bond market and developed interbank  market through which monetary policy can be conducted 
9,335,  a rapidly changing economy making it difficult to understand what the neutral rate might  be and what the equilibrium relationship between monetary aggregates and the real  economy might be 
10,335,  rapid financial innovation that frequently changes the definition of the money supply 
11,335,  a poor track record in controlling inflation in the past making monetary policy intentions  less credible  and
12,335,  an unwillingness of governments to grant genuine independence to the central bank 
13,335,Taken together any or all of these impediments might call into question the effectiveness of any  developing economy s monetary policy framework making any related monetary policy goals  difficult to achieve 
14,335,EXAMPLE  
15,335,Central Bank Effectiveness
16,335,   The reason some inflation targeting banks may target low inflation and not    percent inflation is best described by which of the following statements 
17,335,A  Some inflation is viewed as being good for an economy

2,336,B  Targeting zero percent inflation runs a higher risk of a deflationary  outcome 
3,336,C  It is very difficult to eliminate all inflation from a modern economy 
4,336,   The degree of credibility that a central bank is afforded by economic agents is  important because 
5,336,A  they are the lender of last resort 
6,336,B  their targets can become self fulfilling prophecies 
7,336,C  they are the monopolistic suppliers of the currency 
8,336,Solution to   
9,336,B is correct  Inflation targeting is art not science  Sometimes inflation will be above  target and sometimes below  Were central banks to target zero percent then inflation  would almost certainly be negative on some occasions  If a deflationary mindset then  sets in among economic agents it might be difficult for the central bank to respond to  this because they cannot cut interest rates much below zero 
10,336,Solution to   
11,336,B is correct  If a central bank operates within an inflation targeting regime and if  economic agents believe that it will achieve its target this expectation will become  embedded into wage negotiations for example and become a self fulfilling prophecy   Also banks need to be confident that the central bank will lend them money when all  other sources are closed to them  otherwise they might curtail their lending drastically  leading to a commensurate reduction in money and economic activity 
12,336,       Exchange Rate Targeting
13,336,Many developing economies choose to operate monetary policy by targeting their currency s  exchange rate rather than an explicit level of domestic inflation  Such targeting involves setting  a fixed level or band of values for the exchange rate against a major currency with the central  bank supporting the target by buying and selling the national currency in foreign exchange  markets  There are recent examples of developed economies using such an approach  In the      s following the failure of its policy of trying to control UK inflation by setting medium  term goals for money supply growth  see Example    the UK government decided to operate  monetary policy such that the sterling s exchange rate equalled a pre determined value in terms  of German deutschemarks  The basic idea is that by tying a domestic economy s currency to  that of an economy with a good track record on inflation the domestic economy would  effectively  import  the inflation experience of the low inflation economy

2,337,Suppose that a developing country wished to maintain the value of its currency against the US  dollar  The government and or central bank would announce the currency exchange rate that  they wished to target  To simplify matters let us assume that the domestic inflation rates are  very similar in both countries and that the monetary authorities of the developing economy have  set an exchange rate target that is consistent with relative price levels in the two economies   Under these  admittedly unlikely  circumstances in the absence of shocks there would be no  reason for the exchange rate to deviate significantly from this target level  So as long as  domestic inflation closely mirrors US inflation the exchange rate should remain close to its  target  or within a target band   It is in this sense that a successful exchange rate policy imports  the inflation of the foreign economy 
3,337,Now suppose that economic activity in the developing economy starts to rise rapidly and that  domestic inflation in the developing economy rises above the level in the United States  With a  freely floating exchange rate regime the currency of the developing economy would start to fall  against the dollar  To arrest this fall and to protect the exchange rate target the developing  economy s monetary authority sells foreign currency reserves and buys its own currency  This  has the effect of reducing the domestic money supply and increasing short term interest rates   The developing economy experiences a monetary policy tightening which if expected to bring  down inflation will cause its exchange rate to rise against the dollar 
4,337,By contrast in a scenario in which inflation in the developing country fell relative to the United  States the central bank would need to sell the domestic currency to support the target tending  to increase the domestic money supply and reduce the rate of interest 
5,337,In practice the interventions of the developing economy central bank will simply stabilize the  value of its currency with many frequent adjustments  But this simplistic example should  demonstrate one very important fact  When the central bank or monetary authority chooses to  target an exchange rate interest rates and conditions in the domestic economy must adapt to  accommodate this target and domestic interest rates and money supply can become more  volatile 
6,337,The monetary authority s commitment to and ability to support the exchange rate target must be  credible for exchange rate targeting to be successful  If that is not the case then speculators may  trade against the monetary authority  Speculative attacks forced sterling out of the European  Exchange Rate Mechanism in       The fixed exchange rate regime was abandoned and the  United Kingdom allowed its currency to float freely  Eventually the UK government adopted a  formal inflation target in       Similarly in the Asian financial crisis of           Thailand s  central bank tried to defend the Thai baht against speculative attacks for much of the first half  of      but then revealed at the beginning of July that it had no reserves left  The subsequent  devaluation triggered a debt crisis for banks and companies that had borrowed in foreign  currency and contagion spread throughout Asia 
7,337,Despite these risks many currencies are pegged to other currencies most notably the US dollar   Exhibit    shows a list of some of the currencies that were pegged to  fixed against  the US  dollar at the end of       Other currencies operate under a  managed exchange rate policy   where they are allowed to fluctuate within a range that is maintained by a monetary authority  via market intervention

2,339,Solution to   
3,339,C is correct  The adoption of an exchange rate target requires that the central bank set  interest rates to achieve this target  If the target comes under pressure domestic interest  rates may have to rise regardless of domestic conditions  It may have a  target  level of  inflation in mind as well as  targets  for broad money growth but as long as it targets  the exchange rate domestic inflation and broad money trends must simply be allowed to  evolve 
4,339,Solution to   
5,339,C is correct  Note that interest rates have to be set to achieve this target and are therefore  subordinate to the exchange rate target and partially dependent on economic conditions  in the foreign economy 
6,339,Solution to   
7,339,A is correct  Note that the absence of a liquid government bond market through which a  central bank can enact open market operations and or repo transactions will inhibit the  implementation of monetary policy as would rapid financial innovation because such  innovation can change the relationship between money and economic activity  Fiscal  deficits on the other hand are not normally an impediment to the implementation of  monetary policy although they could be if they were perceived to be unsustainable 
8,339,     Contractionary and Expansionary Monetary Policies and  the Neutral Rate
9,339,Most central banks will adjust liquidity conditions by adjusting their official policy rate    When they believe that economic activity is likely to lead to an increase in inflation they might  increase interest rates thereby reducing liquidity  In these cases market analysts describe such  actions as contractionary because the policy is designed to cause the rate of growth of the  money supply and the real economy to contract  see Exhibit   for the possible transmission  mechanism here   Conversely when the economy is slowing and inflation and monetary trends  are weakening central banks may increase liquidity by cutting their target rate  In these  circumstances monetary policy is said to be expansionary 
10,339,Thus when policy rates are high monetary policy may be described as contractionary  when  low they may be described as expansionary  But what are they  high  and  low  in comparison  to 
11,339,The neutral rate of interest is often taken as the point of comparison  One way of  characterizing the neutral rate is to say that it is that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor  slows down the underlying economy  As such when policy rates are above the neutral rate  monetary policy is contractionary  when they are below the neutral rate monetary policy is  expansionary  The neutral rate should correspond to the average policy rate over a business  cycle

2,340,However economists  views of the neutral rate for any given economy might differ and  therefore their view of whether monetary policy is contractionary neutral or expansionary  might differ too  What economists do agree on is that the neutral policy rate for any economy  comprises two components 
3,340,  Real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy and
4,340,  Long run expected inflation 
5,340,The real trend rate of growth of an economy is also difficult to discern but it corresponds to  that rate of economic growth that is achievable in the long run that gives rise to stable inflation   If we are thinking about an economy with a credible inflation targeting regime where the  inflation target is say   percent per year and where an analyst believes that the economy can  grow sustainably over the long term at a rate of     percent per year then they might also  estimate the neutral rate to be 
6,340,Equation    
7,340,Neutral rate   Trend growth   Inflation target                   
8,340,The analyst would therefore describe the central bank s monetary policy as being contractionary  when its policy rate is above     percent and expansionary when it is below this level 
9,340,In practice central banks often indicate what they believe to be the neutral rate of interest for  their economy too  But determining this  neutral rate  is more art than science  For example  many analysts have recently revised down their estimates of trend growth for many western  countries following the collapse of the credit bubble because in many cases the governments  and private individuals of these economies are now being forced to reduce consumption levels  and pay down their debts 
10,340,What s the Source of the Shock to the Inflation Rate 
11,340,An important aspect of monetary policy for those charged with its conduct is the determination  of the source of any shock to the inflation rate  Suppose that the monetary authority sees that  inflation is rising beyond its target or simply in a way that threatens price stability  If this rise  was caused by an increase in the confidence of consumers and business leaders which in turn  has led to increases in consumption and investment growth rates then we could think of it as  being a demand shock  In this instance it might be appropriate to tighten monetary policy in  order to bring the inflationary pressures generated by these domestic demand pressures under  control 
12,340,However suppose instead that the rise in inflation was caused by a rise in the price of oil  for  the sake of argument   In this case the economy is facing a supply shock and raising interest  rates might make a bad situation worse  Consumers are already facing an increase in the cost of  fuel prices that might cause profits and consumption to fall and eventually unemployment to  rise  Putting up interest rates in this instance might simply exacerbate the oil price induced  downturn which might ultimately cause inflation to fall sharply 
13,340,It is important then for the monetary authority to try to identify the source of the shock before  engineering a contractionary or expansionary monetary policy phase

2,341,     Limitations of Monetary Policy
3,341,The limitations of monetary policy include problems in the transmission mechanism and the  relative ineffectiveness of interest rate adjustment as a policy tool in deflationary environments 
4,341,       Problems in the Monetary Transmission Mechanism
5,341,In Exhibit   we presented a stylized representation of the monetary policy transmission  mechanism including the channels of bank lending rates asset prices expectations and  exchange rates  The implication of the diagram is that there are channels through which the  actions of the central bank or monetary authority are transmitted to both the nominal and real  economy  However there may be some occasions when the will of the monetary authority is  not transmitted seamlessly through the economy 
6,341,Suppose that a central bank raises interest rates because it is concerned about the strength of  underlying inflationary pressures  Long term interest rates are influenced by the path of  expected short term interest rates so the outcome of the rate hike will depend on market  expectations  Suppose that bond market participants think that short term rates are already too  high that the monetary authorities are risking a recession and that the central bank will likely  undershoot its inflation target  This fall in inflation expectations could cause long term interest  rates to fall  That would make long term borrowing cheaper for companies and households  which could in turn stimulate economic activity rather than cause it to contract 
7,341,Arguably the more credible the monetary authority the more stable the long end of the yield  curve  moreover the monetary authority will be more confident that its  policy message  will  be transmitted throughout the economy  A term recently used in the marketplace is bond  market vigilantes  These  vigilantes  are bond market participants who might reduce their  demand for long term bonds thus pushing up their yields if they believe that the monetary  authority is losing its grip on inflation  That yield increase could act as a brake on any loose  monetary policy stance  Conversely the vigilantes may push long term rates down by  increasing their demand for long dated government bonds if they expect that tight monetary  policy is likely to cause a sharp slowdown in the economy thereby loosening monetary  conditions for long term borrowers in the economy 
8,341,A credible monetary policy framework and authority will tend not to require the vigilantes to do  the work for it 
9,341,In very extreme instances there may be occasions where the demand for money becomes  infinitely elastic that is where the demand curve is horizontal and individuals are willing to  hold additional money balances without any change in the interest rate so that further  injections of money into the economy will not serve to further lower interest rates or affect real  activity  This is known as a liquidity trap  In this extreme circumstance monetary policy can  become completely ineffective  The economic conditions for a liquidity trap are associated with  the phenomenon of deflation

2,342,       Interest Rate Adjustment in a Deflationary Environment and  Quantitative Easing as a Response
3,342,Deflation is a pervasive and persistent fall in a general price index and is more difficult for  conventional monetary policy to deal with than inflation  This is because cutting nominal  interest rates much below zero to stimulate the economy is difficult    It is at this point that the  economic conditions for a liquidity trap arise 
4,342,Deflation raises the real value of debt while the persistent fall in prices can encourage  consumers to put off consumption today leading to a fall in demand that leads to further  deflationary pressure  Thus a deflationary  trap  can develop which is characterized by weak  consumption growth falling prices and increases in real debt levels  Japan eventually found  itself in such a position following the collapse of its property bubble in the early     s 
5,342,If conventional monetary policy the adjustment of short term interest rates is no longer  capable of stimulating the economy once the zero or even negative nominal interest rate bound  has been reached is monetary policy useless 
6,342,In the aftermath of the collapse of the high tech bubble in November      Federal Reserve  Governor  now Chairman  Ben Bernanke gave a speech entitled  Deflation  Making Sure  It   Doesn t Happen Here   In this speech Bernanke stated that inflation was always and  everywhere a monetary phenomenon and he expressed great confidence that by expanding the  money supply by various means  including dropping it out of a helicopter on the population  below  the Federal Reserve as the monopoly supplier of money could always engineer positive  inflation in the US economy  He said 
7,342,I am confident that the Fed would take whatever means necessary to prevent  significant deflation in the United States and moreover that the US central bank  in cooperation with other parts of the government as needed has sufficient policy  instruments to ensure that any deflation that might occur would be both mild and  brief 
8,342,Following the collapse of the credit bubble in      a number of governments along with their  central banks cut rates to  near  zero including those in the United States and the United  Kingdom  However there was concern that the underlying economies might not respond to this  drastic monetary medicine mainly because the related banking crisis had caused banks to  reduce their lending drastically  In order to kick start the process both the Federal Reserve and  the Bank of England effectively printed money and pumped it in to their respective economies   This  unconventional  approach to monetary policy known as quantitative easing  QE  is  operationally similar to open market purchase operations but conducted on a much larger scale 
9,342,The additional reserves created by central banks in a policy of quantitative easing can be used to  buy any assets  The Bank of England chose to buy gilts  bonds issued by the UK government   where the focus was on gilts with three to five years maturity  The idea was that this additional  reserve would kick start lending causing broad money growth to expand which would  eventually lead to an increase in real economic activity  But there is no guarantee that banks  will respond in this way  In a difficult economic climate it may be better to hold excess  reserves rather than to lend to households and businesses that may default

2,343,In the United States the formal plan for QE mainly involved the purchase of mortgage bonds  issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae  Part of the intention was to push down  mortgage rates to support the US housing market as well as to increase the growth rate of broad  money  Before implementing this formal program the Federal Reserve intervened in several  other markets that were failing for lack of liquidity including interbank markets and the  commercial paper market  These interventions had a similar effect on the Federal Reserve s  balance sheet and the money supply as the later QE program 
3,343,This first round of QE by the Federal Reserve was then followed by a further round of QE  known as QE   In November      the Federal Reserve judged that the US economy had not  responded sufficiently to the first round of QE  QE    The Fed announced that it would create       billion and use this money to purchase long dated US Treasuries in equal tranches over  the following eight months  The purpose of QE  was to ensure that long bond yields remained  low in order to encourage businesses and households to borrow for investment and consumption  purposes respectively 
4,343,As long as they have the appropriate authority from the government central banks can purchase  any assets in a quantitative easing program  But the risks involved in purchasing assets with  credit risk should be clear  In the end the central bank is just a special bank  If it accumulates  bad assets that then turn out to create losses it could face a fatal loss of confidence in its main  product  fiat money 
5,343,       Limitations of Monetary Policy  Summary
6,343,The ultimate problem for monetary authorities as they try to manipulate the supply of money in  order to influence the real economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that  households and corporations put in banks on deposit nor can they easily control the willingness  of banks to create money by expanding credit  Taken together this also means that they cannot  always control the money supply  Therefore there are definite limits to the power of monetary  policy

2,344,The Background
3,344,Between the     s and     s Japan s economy achieved faster real growth than any  other G  economy  But the terrific success of the economy sowed the seeds of the  problems that were to follow  The very high real growth rates achieved by Japan over  four decades became built in to asset prices particularly equity and commercial property  prices  Toward the end of the     s asset prices rose to even higher levels when the  Bank of Japan followed a very easy monetary policy as it tried to prevent the Japanese  yen from appreciating too much against the US dollar  However when interest rates  went up in           and the economy slowed investors eventually came to believe  that the growth assumptions that were built in to asset prices and other aspects of the  Japanese economy were unrealistic  This realization caused Japanese asset prices to  collapse  For example the Nikkei     stock market index reached       in       by  the end of March      it had fallen by    percent to       The collapse in asset prices  caused wealth to decline dramatically  Consumer confidence understandably fell sharply  too and consumption growth slowed  Corporate spending also fell while bank lending  contracted sharply in the weak economic climate  Although many of these phenomena  are apparent in all recessions the situation was made worse when deflation set in  In an  environment when prices are falling consumers may put off discretionary spending  today until tomorrow  by doing this however they exacerbate the deflationary  environment  Deflation also raises the real value of debts  as deflation takes hold  borrowers find the real value of their debts rising and may try to increase their savings  accordingly  Once again such actions exacerbate the recessionary conditions 
4,344,The Monetary Policy Response
5,344,Faced with such a downturn the conventional monetary policy response is to cut interest  rates to try to stimulate real economic activity  The Japanese central bank the Bank of  Japan cut rates from   percent in      to   percent by       By February      the  Japanese policy rate was cut to zero where it stayed 
6,344,Once rates are at or near zero there are two broad approaches suggested by theory  though the two are usually complementary  First the central bank can try to convince  markets that interest rates will remain low for a long time even after the economy and  inflation pick up  This will tend to lower interest rates along the yield curve  Second the  central bank can try to increase the money supply by purchasing assets from the private  sector so called quantitative easing  The Bank of Japan  BoJ  did both in       It  embarked on a program of quantitative easing supplemented by an explicit promise not  to raise short term interest rates until deflation had given way to inflation 
7,344,Quantitative easing simply involves the printing of money by the central bank  In  practice this involved the BoJ using open market operations to add reserves to the  banking system through the direct purchase of government securities in the open market 
8,344,The reserve levels became the new target  The BoJ s monetary policy committee  determined the level of reserves and the quantity of bond purchases that should be  undertaken rather than voting on the policy rate 
9,344,The success of this policy is difficult to judge  As the chart below shows although  deflation turned to inflation for a while it returned to deflation in           when the  Japanese economy suffered a sharp recession along with much of the rest of the world   At that time having reversed its QE policy during           by reducing its bond  holdings the Bank of Japan began to buy again

2,345,Economists debate the point but arguably the Bank of Japan needed to implement a  much larger program of QE to eliminate deflation  Japan s program amounted to a  cumulative     percent of GDP spread over three years whereas the United States and  United Kingdom implemented programs totaling    percent and    percent  respectively in about one year between      and       The Japanese experience  suggests that there may be limits to the power of monetary policy

2,346,   An increase in a central bank s policy rate might be expected to reduce  inflationary pressures by 
3,346,A  reducing consumer demand 
4,346,B  reducing the foreign exchange value of the currency 
5,346,C  driving up asset prices leading to an increase in personal sector wealth 
6,346,   Which of the following statements best describes a fundamental limitation of  monetary policy  Monetary policy is limited because central bankers 
7,346,A  cannot control the inflation rate perfectly 
8,346,B  are appointed by politicians and are therefore never truly independent 
9,346,C  cannot control the amount of money that economic agents put in banks nor  the willingness of banks to make loans 
10,346,Solution to   
11,346,A is correct  The neutral rate of interest which in this example is   percent is  considered to be that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor slows down the underlying  economy  As such when policy rates are above the neutral rate monetary policy is  contractionary  when they are below the neutral rate monetary policy is expansionary  It  comprises two components  the real trend rate of growth of the underlying economy  in  this example   percent  and long run expected inflation  in this example   percent  
12,346,Solution to   
13,346,A is correct  If an increase in the central bank s policy rate is successfully transmitted  via the money markets to other parts of the financial sector consumer demand might  decline as the rate of interest on mortgages and other credit rises  This decline in  consumer demand should all other things being equal and amongst other affects lead to  a reduction in upward pressure on consumer prices 
14,346,Solution to   
15,346,C is correct  Central bankers do not control the decisions of individuals and banks that  can influence the money creation process 
16,346,   FISCAL POLICY
17,346,The second set of tools used for influencing economic activity consists of the tools associated  with fiscal policy  These involve the use of government spending and changing tax revenue to  affect a number of aspects of the economy

3,347,  Distribution of income and wealth among different segments of the population 
4,347,  Allocation of resources between different sectors and economic agents 
5,347,Often a discussion of fiscal policy focuses on the impact of changes in the difference between  government spending and revenue on the aggregate economy rather than on the actual levels of  spending and revenue themselves 
6,347,     Roles and Objectives of Fiscal Policy
7,347,A primary aim for fiscal policy is to help manage the economy through its influence on  aggregate national output that is real GDP 
8,347,       Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Demand
9,347,Aggregate demand is the amount companies and households plan to spend  We can consider a  number of ways that fiscal policy can influence aggregate demand  For example an  expansionary policy could take one or more of the following forms 
10,347,  Cuts in personal income tax raise disposable income with the objective of boosting  aggregate demand 
11,347,  Cuts in sales  indirect  taxes to lower prices which raises real incomes with the objective  of raising consumer demand 
12,347,  Cuts in corporation  company  taxes to boost business profits which may raise capital  spending 
13,347,  Cuts in tax rates on personal savings to raise disposable income for those with savings  with the objective of raising consumer demand 
14,347,  New public spending on social goods and infrastructure such as hospitals and schools  boosting personal incomes with the objective of raising aggregate demand 
15,347,We must stress however that the reliability and magnitude of these relationships will vary over  time and from country to country  For example in a recession with rising unemployment it is  not always the case that cuts in income taxes will raise consumer spending because consumers  may wish to raise their precautionary  rainy day  saving in anticipation of further deterioration  in the economy  Indeed in very general terms economists are often divided into two camps  regarding the workings of fiscal policy  Keynesians believe that fiscal policy can have  powerful effects on aggregate demand output and employment when there is substantial spare  capacity in an economy  Monetarists believe that fiscal changes only have a temporary effect  on aggregate demand and that monetary policy is a more effective tool for restraining or  boosting inflationary pressures  Monetarists tend not to advocate using monetary policy for  countercyclical adjustment of aggregate demand  This intellectual division will naturally be  reflected in economists  divergent views on the efficacy of the large fiscal expansions observed  in many countries following the credit crisis of      along with differing views on the possible  impact of quantitative easing

4,348,Taxes are formally defined as compulsory unrequited payments to the general government   they are unrequited in the sense that benefits provided by a government to taxpayers are  usually not related to payments   Exhibit    contains taxes on incomes and profits social  security contributions indirect taxes on goods and services employment taxes and taxes on the  ownership and transfer of property

7,349,Clearly the possibility that fiscal policy can influence output means that it may be an important  tool for economic stabilization  In a recession governments can raise spending   expansionary fiscal policy  in an attempt to raise employment and output  In boom  times when an economy has full employment and wages and prices are rising too fast then  government spending may be reduced and taxes raised  contractionary fiscal policy  
8,349,Hence a key concept is the budget surplus deficit which is the difference between  government revenue and expenditure for a fixed period of time such as a fiscal or calendar  year  Government revenue includes tax revenues net of transfer payments  government  spending includes interest payments on the government debt  Analysts often focus on changes  in the budget surplus or deficit from year to year as indicators of whether the fiscal policy is  getting tighter or looser  An increase in a budget surplus would be associated with  contractionary fiscal policy while a rise in a deficit is an expansionary fiscal policy  Of course  over the course of a business cycle the budget surplus will vary automatically in a  countercyclical way  For example as an economy slows and unemployment rises government  spending on social insurance and unemployment benefits will also rise and add to aggregate  demand  This is known as an automatic stabilizer  Similarly if boom conditions ensue and  employment and incomes are high then progressive income and profit taxes are rising and also  act as automatic stabilizers increasing budget surplus or reducing budget deficit  The great  advantage of automatic stabilizers is that they are indeed automatic not requiring the  identification of shocks to which policymakers must consider a response  By reducing the  responsiveness of the economy to shocks these automatic stabilizers reduce output fluctuations   Automatic stabilizers should be distinguished from discretionary fiscal policies such as changes  in government spending or tax rates which are actively used to stabilize aggregate demand  If  government spending and revenues are equal then the budget is balanced

4,350,The precise components of revenue and expenditure will of course vary over time and  between countries  But as an example of the breakdown of expenditure and revenue in  Exhibits    and    we have presented the budget projections of the United Kingdom for             The budget projected that total spending would come to     bn while total  revenue would only be     bn  The government was therefore forecasting a budget  shortfall of     bn for the fiscal year meaning that it had an associated need to borrow      bn from the private sector in the United Kingdom or the private and public sectors  of other economies

4,351,       Deficits and the National Debt
5,351,Government deficits are the difference between government revenues and expenditures over a  period of calendar time usually a year  Government  or national  debt is the accumulation over  time of these deficits  Government deficits are financed by borrowing from the private sector  often via private pension and insurance fund portfolio investments  We saw above that  governments are more likely to have deficits than surpluses over long periods of time  As a  result there may exist a large stock of outstanding government debt owned by the private  sector  This will vary as the business cycle ebbs and flows  Exhibit    shows the time path of  the ratio of public debt to GDP for the United Kingdom over several hundred years  It can be  clearly seen that the major cause of fluctuations in that ratio through history has been the  financing of wars in particular the Napoleonic Wars of           and the First and Second  World Wars of           and

2,353,Ultimately if the ratio of debt to GDP rises beyond a certain unknown point then the solvency  of the country comes into question  An additional indicator for potential insolvency is the ratio  of interest rate payments to GDP which is shown for some major economies in Exhibit      These represent payments required of governments to service their debts as a percentage of  national output and as such reflect both the size of debts and the interest charged on them  Such  ratios could rise rapidly with the growing debt ratios of      and      particularly if the  interest rates on the debt were to rise from the historically low levels

8,353,Governments  spending was far in excess of revenues following the credit crisis of            as governments tried to stimulate their economies  this level of spending raised concerns in  some quarters about the scale of governmental debt accumulation  Exhibit    shows that gross  government financial liabilities relative to GDP for the OECD countries overall rose from       percent in      to      percent in       In Japan where fiscal spending has been used to  stimulate the economy from the early     s the ratio has risen from      percent in      to        percent in       If an economy grows in real terms so do the real tax revenues and hence  the ability to service a growing real debt at constant tax rate levels  However if the real growth  in the economy is lower than the real interest rate on the debt then the debt ratio will worsen  even though the economy is growing because the debt burden  i e  the real interest rate times  the debt  grows faster than the economy  Hence an important issue for governments and their  creditors is whether their additional spending leads to sufficiently higher tax revenues to pay the  interest on the debt used to finance the extra spending 
9,353,However within a national economy the real value of the outstanding debt will fall if the  overall price level rises  i e  inflation and hence a rise in nominal GDP even if real GDP is  static  and thus the ratio of debt to GDP may not be rising  But if the general price level falls   i e  deflation  then the ratio may stay elevated for longer  If net interest payments rise rapidly  and investors lose confidence in a government s ability to honour its debts then financing costs  may escalate even more quickly and make the situation unstable 
10,353,Should we be concerned about the size of a national debt  relative to GDP   There are strong  arguments both for and against 
11,353,The arguments against being concerned about national debt  relative to GDP  are as  follows

2,354,  The scale of the problem may be overstated because the debt is owed internally to  fellow citizens  This is certainly the case in Japan where    percent is owned by  Japanese residents  In the United States and United Kingdom the figures are     percent and    percent respectively  South Korea and Canada have only   percent  and   percent non resident ownership of government debt respectively  But Italy  has    percent   
3,354,  A proportion of the money borrowed may have been used for capital investment  projects or enhancing human capital  e g  training education   these should lead to  raised future output and tax revenues 
4,354,  Large fiscal deficits require tax changes which may actually reduce distortions  caused by existing tax structures 
5,354,  Deficits may have no net impact because the private sector may act to offset fiscal  deficits by increasing saving in anticipation of future increased taxes  This  argument is known as  Ricardian equivalence  and is discussed in more detail  later 
6,354,  If there is unemployment in an economy then the debt is not diverting activity  away from productive uses  and indeed the debt could be associated with an  increase in employment  
7,354,The arguments in favour of being concerned are 
8,354,  High levels of debt to GDP may lead to higher tax rates in the search for higher tax  revenues  This may lead to disincentives to economic activity as the higher  marginal tax rates reduce labour effort and entrepreneurial activity leading to  lower growth in the long run 
9,354,  If markets lose confidence in a government then the central bank may have to print  money to finance a government deficit  This may lead ultimately to high inflation  as evidenced by the economic history of Germany in the     s and more recently  in Zimbabwe 
10,354,  Government borrowing may divert private sector investment from taking place  an  effect known as crowding out   if there is a limited amount of savings to be spent  on investment then larger government demands will lead to higher interest rates  and lower private sector investing 
11,354,An important distinction to make is between long  and short run effects  Over short periods of  time  say a few years  crowding out may have little effect  If it lasts for a longer time  however then capital accumulation in an economy may be damaged  Similarly tax distortions  may not be too serious over the short term but will have a more substantial impact over many  years

3,355,B  Cuts in personal income taxes
4,355,C  New capital spending by the government on road building
5,355,   Fiscal expansions will most likely have the most impact on aggregate output when  the economy is in which of the following states 
6,355,A  Full employment
7,355,B  Near full employment
8,355,C  Considerable unemployment
9,355,   Which one of the following is most likely a reason to not use fiscal deficits as an  expansionary tool 
10,355,A  They may crowd out private investment 
11,355,B  They may facilitate tax changes to reduce distortions in an economy 
12,355,C  They may stimulate employment when there is substantial unemployment  in an economy 
13,355,Solution to   
14,355,A is correct  A rise in capital gains taxes reduces income available for spending and  hence reduces aggregate demand other things being equal  Cutting income tax raises  disposable income while new road building raises employment and incomes  in both  cases aggregate demand rises and hence policy is expansionary 
15,355,Solution to   
16,355,C is correct  When an economy is close to full employment a fiscal expansion raising  aggregate demand can have little impact on output because there are few spare unused  resources  e g  labour or idle factories   instead there will be upward pressure on prices   i e  inflation  
17,355,Solution to   
18,355,A is correct  A frequent argument against raises in fiscal deficits is that the additional  borrowing to fund the deficit in financial markets will displace private sector borrowing  for investment  i e   crowd it out   
19,355,     Fiscal Policy Tools and the Macroeconomy
20,355,We now look at the nature of the fiscal tools available to a government  Government spending  can take a variety of forms 
21,355,http   e pub  mptyhhp f zuur m  s vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print

2,356,  Transfer payments are welfare payments made through the social security system and  depending on the country comprise payments for state pensions housing benefits tax  credits and income support for poorer families child benefits unemployment benefits  and job search allowances  Transfer payments exist to provide a basic minimum level of  income for low income households and they also provide a means by which a  government can change the overall income distribution in a society  Note that these  payments are not included in the definition of GDP because they do not reflect a reward  to a factor of production for economic activity  Also they are not considered to be part of  general government spending on goods and services 
3,356,  Current government spending involves spending on goods and services that are  provided on a regular recurring basis including health education and defense  Clearly  such spending will have a big impact on a country s skill level and overall labour  productivity 
4,356,  Capital expenditure includes infrastructure spending on roads hospitals prisons and  schools  This investment spending will add to a nation s capital stock and affect  productive potential for an economy 
5,356,Government spending can be justified on both economic and social grounds 
6,356,  To provide such services as defense that benefit all citizens equally 
7,356,  For infrastructure capital spending  e g  roads  to help a country s economic growth 
8,356,  To guarantee a minimum level of income for poorer people and hence redistribute income  and wealth  e g  welfare and related benefits  
9,356,  To influence a government s economic objectives of low inflation and high employment  and growth  e g  management of aggregate demand  
10,356,  To subsidize the development of innovative and high risk new products or markets  e g   alternative energy sources  
11,356,Government revenues can take several forms 
12,356,  Direct taxes are levied on income wealth and corporate profits and include capital  gains taxes national insurance  or labour  taxes and corporate taxes  They may also  include a local income or property tax for both individuals and businesses  Inheritance tax  on a deceased s estate will have both revenue raising and wealth redistribution aspects 
13,356,  Indirect taxes are taxes on spending on a variety of goods and services in an  economy such as the excise duties on fuel alcohol and tobacco as well as sales  or  value added tax  and often exclude health and education products on social grounds  In  addition taxes on gambling may also be considered to have a social aspect in deterring  such activity while fuel duties will have an environmental purpose in making fuel  consumption and hence travel more expensive 
14,356,Taxes can be justified both in terms of raising revenues to finance expenditures and in terms of  income and wealth redistribution policies  Economists typically consider four desirable  attributes of a tax policy

2,357,  Simplicity  This refers to ease of compliance by the taxpayer and enforcement by the  revenue authorities  The final liability should be certain and not easily manipulated 
3,357,  Efficiency  Taxation should interfere as little as possible in the choices individuals make  in the market place  Taxes affect behaviour and should in general discourage work and  investment as little as possible  A major philosophical issue among economists is whether  tax policy should deliberately deviate from efficiency to promote  good  economic  activities such as savings and discourage harmful ones such as tobacco consumption   Although most would accept a limited role in guiding consumer choices some will  question how well equipped policymakers are to decide on such objectives and whether  there will be unwanted ancillary effects such as giving tax breaks for saving among  people who already save and whose behaviour does not change 
4,357,  Fairness  This refers to the fact that people in similar situations should pay the same  taxes   horizontal equity   and that richer people should pay more taxes   vertical  equity    Of course the concept of fairness is really subjective  Still most would agree  that income tax rates should be progressive that is that households and corporations  should pay proportionately more as their incomes rise  However some people advocate   flat  tax rates whereby all should pay the same proportion of taxable income 
5,357,  Revenue sufficiency  Although revenue sufficiency may seem obvious as a criterion for  tax policy there may be a conflict with fairness and efficiency  For example one may  believe that increasing income tax rates to reduce fiscal deficits reduces labour effort and  that tax rate increases are thus an inefficient policy tool 
6,357,EXAMPLE   
7,357,Some Issues with Tax Policy
8,357,   Incentives  Some economists believe that income taxes reduce the incentive to  work save and invest and that the overall tax burden has become excessive   These ideas are often associated with supply side economics and the US  economist Arthur Laffer  A variety of income tax cuts and simplifications have  taken place in the United States since      and although there is substantial  controversy some claim that work effort did rise  although tax cuts had little  impact on savings   Similarly some found that business investment did rise while  others claimed it was independent of such cuts 
9,357,   Fairness  How do we judge the fairness of the tax system  One way is to calibrate  the tax burden falling on different groups of people ranked by their income and to  assess how changes in taxes affect these groups  Of course this imposes huge data  demands on investigators and must be considered incomplete  In the United  States it has been found that the federal system is indeed highly progressive   Many countries use such methods to analyze the impact of tax changes on  different income groups when they announce their annual fiscal policy plans

2,358,   Tax reform  There is continuous debate on reforming tax policy  Should there be a  flat rate tax on labour income  Should all investment be immediately deducted for  corporate taxes  Should more revenue be sourced from consumption taxes   Should taxes be indexed to inflation  Should dividends be taxed when profits  have already been subject to tax  Should estates be taxed at all  Many of these  issues are raised in the context of their impact on economic growth

4,358,Fiscal Tools
5,358,   Which of the following is not a tool of fiscal policy 
6,358,A  A rise in social transfer payments
7,358,B  The purchase of new equipment for the armed forces
8,358,C  An increase in deposit requirements for the buying of houses
9,358,   Which of the following is not an indirect tax 
10,358,A  Excise duty
11,358,B  Value added Tax
12,358,C  Employment taxes
13,358,   Which of the following statements is most accurate 
14,358,A  Direct taxes are useful for discouraging alcohol consumption 
15,358,B  Because indirect taxes cannot be changed quickly they are of no use in  fiscal policy 
16,358,C  Government capital spending decisions are slow to plan implement and  execute and hence are of little use for short term economic stabilization 
17,358,Solution to   
18,358,C is correct  Rises in deposit requirements for house purchases are intended to reduce  the demand for credit for house purchases and hence would be considered a tool of  monetary policy  This is a policy used actively in several countries and is under  consideration by regulators in other countries to constrain house price inflation 
19,358,Solution to   
20,358,C is correct  Both excise duty and VAT are applied to prices whereas taxes on  employment apply to labour income and hence are not indirect taxes

2,359,Solution to   
3,359,C is correct  Capital spending is much slower to implement than changes in indirect  taxes  and indirect taxes affect alcohol consumption more directly than direct taxes 
4,359,       The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the Different Tools of  Fiscal Policy
5,359,The different tools used to expedite fiscal policy as a means to try to put or keep an economy on  a path of positive stable growth with low inflation have both advantages and disadvantages 
6,359,Advantages 
7,359,  Indirect taxes can be adjusted almost immediately after they are announced and can  influence spending behaviour instantly and generate revenue for the government at little  or no cost to the government 
8,359,  Social policies such as discouraging alcohol or tobacco use can be adjusted almost  instantly by raising such taxes 
9,359,Disadvantages 
10,359,  Direct taxes are more difficult to change without considerable notice often many months  because payroll computer systems will have to be adjusted  although the announcement  itself may well have a powerful effect on spending behaviour more immediately   The  same may be said for welfare and other social transfers 
11,359,  Capital spending plans take longer to formulate and implement typically over a period of  years  For example building a road or hospital requires detailed planning legal  permissions and implementation  This is often a valid criticism of an active fiscal policy  and was widely heard during the US fiscal stimulus in            On the other hand  such policies add to the productive potential of an economy unlike a change in personal  or indirect taxes  Of course the slower the impact of a fiscal change the more likely  other exogenous changes will already be influencing the economy before the fiscal  change kicks in 
12,359,The above mentioned tools may also have expectational effects at least as powerful as the direct  effects  The announcement of future income tax rises a year ahead could potentially lead to  reduced consumption immediately  Such delayed tax rises were a feature of UK fiscal policy of             however the evidence is anecdotal because spending behaviour changed little until  the delayed tax changes actually came into force 
13,359,We may also consider the relative potency of the different fiscal tools  Direct government  spending has a far bigger impact on aggregate spending and output than income tax cuts or  transfer increases  however if the latter are directed at the poorest in society  basically those  who spend all their income  then this will give a relatively strong boost  Further discussion and  examples of these comparisons are given in section   below on the interaction between  monetary and fiscal policy

2,360,       Modeling the Impact of Taxes and Government Spending  The  Fiscal Multiplier
3,360,The conventional macroeconomic model has government spending G adding directly to  aggregate demand AD and reducing it via taxes T  these comprise both indirect taxes on  expenditures and direct taxes on factor incomes  Further government spending is increased via  the payment of transfer benefits B such as social security payments  Hence the net impact of  the government sector on aggregate demand is 
4,360,Equation    
5,360,G   T   B   Budget surplus OR deficit
6,360,Net taxes  NT  taxes less transfers  reduce disposable income  YD  available to individuals  relative to national income or output  Y  as follows 
7,360,Equation    
8,360,YD   Y   NT        t  Y
9,360,where t is the net tax rate  Net taxes are often assumed to be proportional to national income  Y and hence total tax revenue from net taxes is tY  If t       or     then for every    rise in  national income net tax revenue will rise by    cents and household disposable income will rise  by    cents 
10,360,The fiscal multiplier is important in macroeconomics because it tells us how much output  changes as exogenous changes occur in government spending or taxation  The recipients of the  increase in government spending will typically save a proportion     c of each additional dollar  of disposable income where c is the marginal propensity to consume  MPC  this additional  income  Ignoring income taxes we can see that  c will in turn be spent by these recipients on  more goods and services  The recipients of this  c will themselves spend a proportion c of this  additional income  i e   c   c or c squared   This process continues with income and spending  growing at a constant rate of c as it passes from hand to hand through the economy  This is the  familiar geometric progression with constant factor c where     c      The sum of this  geometric series is        c  
11,360,We define s as the marginal propensity to save  MPS  the amount saved out of an  additional dollar of disposable income  Because c   s     hence s      c

2,361,For every dollar of new  additional  spending total incomes and spending rises by         c    And because     c     this must be      this is the multiplier  If c        or individuals spend     percent of additions to income  then the multiplier                    
3,361,A formal definition of the multiplier would be the ratio of the change in equilibrium output to  the change in autonomous spending that caused the change  This is a monetary measure but  because prices are assumed to be constant in this analysis real and monetary amounts are  identical  Given that fiscal policy is about changes in government spending G net taxes NT  and tax rates t we can see that the multiplier is an important tool for calibrating the possible  impact of policy changes on output  How can we introduce tax changes into the multiplier  concept  We do this by introducing the idea of disposable income YD defined as income less  income taxes net of transfers Y   NT 
4,361,Households spend a proportion c of disposable income YD that is cYD or c Y   NT  or c      t Y  The marginal propensity to consume in the presence of taxes is then c     t   If the  government increases spending say on road building by an amount G then disposable income  rises by      t G and consumer spending by c     t G  Provided there are unused sources of  capital and labour in the economy this leads to a rise in aggregate demand and output  the  recipients of this extra consumption spending will have      t c     t G extra disposable income  available and will spend c of it  This cumulative extra spending and income will continue to  spread through the economy at a decreasing rate as     c     t       The overall final impact on  aggregate demand and output will effectively be the sum of this decreasing geometric series  with common ratio c     t  and this sums to        c     t    This is known as the fiscal  multiplier and is very relevant to studies of fiscal policy as changes in G or tax rates will affect  output in an economy through the value of the multiplier 
5,361,For example if the tax rate is    percent or     and the marginal propensity to spend is     percent or     then the fiscal multiplier will be                       or                In other  words if the government raises G by    billion total incomes and spending rise by        billion 
6,361,Discretionary fiscal policy  see below  will involve changes in these variables with a view to  influencing Y 
7,361,       The Balanced Budget Multiplier
8,361,If a government increases G by the same amount as it raises taxes the aggregate output actually  rises  Why is this 
9,361,It is because the marginal propensity to spend out of disposable income is less than   and hence  for every dollar less in YD spending only falls  c  Hence aggregate spending falls less than the  tax rise by a factor of c  A balanced budget leads to a rise in output which in turn leads to  further rises in output and incomes via the multiplier effect

2,362,Suppose an economy has an equilibrium output or income level of       consisting of      of  consumption and      of investment spending which is fixed and not related to income  If  government spending is set at      financed by a tax rate of    percent  giving tax revenue of        what will happen to output  First additional government spending of      will raise  output by that amount  but will taxes of      reduce output by a similar amount  Not if the  MPC is less than    suppose it is     and hence spending will only fall by    percent of       or       The initial impact of the balanced fiscal package on aggregate demand will be to raise  it by                  This additional output will in turn lead to further increases in income  and output through the multiplier effect 
3,362,Even though the above policy involved a combination of government spending and tax  increases that initially left the government s budget deficit surplus unchanged the induced rise  in output will lead to further tax revenue increases and a further change in the budget position   Could the government adjust the initial change in spending to offset exactly the eventual total  change in tax revenues  The answer is  yes  and we can ask what will be the effect on output  of this genuinely balanced budget change  This balanced budget multiplier always takes the  value unity 
4,362,EXAMPLE   
5,362,Government Debt Deficits and Ricardo
6,362,The total stock of government debt is the outstanding stock of IOUs issued by a  government and not yet repaid  They are issued when the government has insufficient  tax revenues to meet expenditures and has to borrow from the public  The size of the  outstanding debt equals the cumulative quantity of net borrowing it has done and the  fiscal or budget deficit is added in the current period to the outstanding stock of debt  If  the outstanding stock of debt falls we have a negative deficit or a surplus 
7,362,If a government reduces taxation by     billion one year and replaces that revenue with  borrowing of     billion from the public will it have any real impact on the economy   The important issue here is how people perceive that action  Do they recognize what  will happen over time as interest and bond principal have to be repaid out of future  taxes  If so they may think of the bond finance as equivalent to delayed taxation  finance  thus the reduction in current taxation will have no impact on spending because  individuals save more in anticipation of higher future taxes to repay the bond  This is  called Ricardian equivalence after the economist David Ricardo  If people do not  correctly anticipate all the future taxes required to repay the additional government debt  then they feel wealthier when the debt is issued and may increase their spending adding  to aggregate demand 
8,362,Whether Ricardian equivalence holds in practice is ultimately an empirical issue and is  difficult to calibrate conclusively given the number of things that are changing at any  time in a modern economy

2,363,     Fiscal Policy Implementation  Active and Discretionary  Fiscal Policy
3,363,In the following we discuss major issues in fiscal policy implementation 
4,363,       Deficits and the Fiscal Stance
5,363,An important question is the extent to which the budget is a useful measure of the government s  fiscal stance  Does the size of the deficit actually indicate whether fiscal policy is  expansionary or contractionary  Clearly such a question is important for economic  policymakers insofar as the deficit can change for reasons unrelated to actual fiscal policy  changes  For example the automatic stabilizers mentioned earlier will lead to changes in the  budget deficit unrelated to fiscal policy changes  a recession will cause tax revenues to fall and  the budget deficit to rise  An observer may conclude that fiscal policy has been loosened and is  expansionary and that no further government action is required 
6,363,To this end economists often look at the structural  or cyclically adjusted  budget deficit
7,363,as an indicator of the fiscal stance  This is defined as the deficit that would exist if the economy  was at full employment  or full potential output   Hence if we consider a period of relatively  high unemployment such as           with around      percent of the workforce out of work  in the United States and Europe then the budget deficits in those countries would be expected  to be reduced substantially if the economies returned to full employment  At this level tax  revenues would be higher and social transfers lower  Recent data for major countries are given  in Exhibit    where negative numbers refer to deficits and positive numbers are surpluses

2,364,A further reason why actual government deficits may not be a good measure of fiscal stance is  the distinction between real and nominal interest rates and the role of inflation adjustment when  applied to budget deficits  Although national economic statistics treat the cash interest payments  on debt as government expenditure it makes more sense to consider only the inflation adjusted   or real  interest payments because the real value of the outstanding debt is being eroded by  inflation  Automatic stabilizers such as income tax VAT and social benefits are important  because as output and employment fall and reduce tax revenues so net tax revenues also fall as  unemployment benefits rise  This acts as a fiscal stimulus and serves to reduce the size of the  multiplier dampening the output response of whatever caused the fall in output in the first  place  By their very nature automatic stabilizers do not require policy changes  no policymaker  has to decide that an economic shock has occurred and how to respond  Hence the  responsiveness of the economy to shocks is automatically reduced as are movements in  employment and output 
3,364,In addition to these automatic adjustments governments also use discretionary fiscal  adjustments to influence aggregate demand  These will involve tax changes and or spending  cuts or increases usually with the aim of stabilizing the economy  A natural question is why  fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate demand completely hence ensuring full employment at  all times 
4,364,       Difficulties in Executing Fiscal Policy
5,364,Fiscal policy cannot stabilize aggregate demand completely because the difficulties in executing  fiscal policy cannot be completely overcome 
6,364,First the policymaker does not have complete information on how the economy functions  It  may take several months for policymakers to realize that an economy is slowing because data  appear with a considerable time lag and even then are subject to substantial revision  This is  often called the recognition lag and has been likened to the problem of driving with the rear  view mirror  Then when policy changes are finally decided on they may take many months to  implement  This is the action lag  If a government decides to raise spending on capital projects  to increase employment and incomes for example these may take many months to plan and put  into action  Finally the result of these actions on the economy will take additional time to  become evident  this is the impact lag  These types of policy lags also occur in the case of  discretionary monetary policy 
7,364,A second aspect of time in this process is the uncertainty of where the economy is heading  independently of these policy changes  For example a stimulus may occur simultaneously with  a surprise rise in investment spending or in the demand for a country s exports just as  discretionary government spending starts to rise  Macroeconomic forecasting models do not  generally have a good track record for accuracy and hence cannot be relied on to aid the policy  making process in this context  In addition when discretionary fiscal adjustments are  announced  or are already underway  private sector behaviour may well change leading to rises  in consumption or investment both of which will reinforce the effects of a rise in government  expenditure  Again this will make it difficult to calibrate the required fiscal adjustment to  secure full employment 
8,364,There are wider macroeconomic issues also involved here

2,365,  If the government is concerned with both unemployment and inflation in an economy  then raising aggregate demand toward the full employment level may also lead to a  tightening labour market and rising wages and prices  The policymaker may be reluctant  to further fine tune fiscal policy in an uncertain world because it might induce inflation 
3,365,  If the budget deficit is already large relative to GDP and further fiscal stimulus is  required then the necessary increase in the deficit may be considered unacceptable by the  financial markets when government funding is raised leading to higher interest rates on  government debt and political pressure to tackle the deficit 
4,365,  Of course all this presupposes that we know the level of full employment which is  difficult to measure accurately  Fiscal expansion raises demand but what if we are  already at full employment which will be changing as productive capacity changes and  workers  willingness to work at various wage levels changes 
5,365,  If unused resources reflect a low supply of labour or other factors rather than a shortage  of demand then discretionary fiscal policy will not add to demand and will be ineffective  raising the risk of inflationary pressures in the economy 
6,365,  The issue of crowding out may occur  If the government borrows from a limited pool of  savings the competition for funds with the private sector may crowd out private firms  with subsequent less investing and economic growth  In addition the cost of borrowing  may rise leading to the cancellation of potentially profitable opportunities  This concept  is the subject of continuing empirical debate and investigation

12,367,Solution to

14,367,   THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MONETARY  AND FISCAL POLICY
15,367,Both monetary and fiscal policies can be used to try and influence the macroeconomy  But the  impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand may differ depending on the fiscal policy  stance  Conversely the impact of fiscal policy might vary under various alternative monetary  policy conditions  Clearly policymakers need to understand this interaction  For example they  need to consider the impact of changes to the budget when monetary policy is accommodative  as opposed to when it is restrictive  Can we expect the same impact on aggregate demand in  both situations

2,368,Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand they do so through  differing channels with differing impact on the composition of aggregate demand  The two  policies are not interchangeable  Consider the following cases in which the assumption is made  that wages and prices are rigid 
3,368,  Easy fiscal policy tight monetary policy  If taxes are cut or government spending rises  the expansionary fiscal policy will lead to a rise in aggregate output  If this is  accompanied by a reduction in money supply to offset the fiscal expansion then interest  rates will rise and have a negative effect on private sector demand  We have higher output  and higher interest rates and government spending will be a larger proportion of overall  national income 
4,368,  Tight fiscal policy easy monetary policy  If a fiscal contraction is accompanied by  expansionary monetary policy and low interest rates then the private sector will be  stimulated and will rise as a share of GDP while the public sector will shrink 
5,368,  Easy monetary policy easy fiscal policy  If both fiscal and monetary policy are easy then  the joint impact will be highly expansionary leading to a rise in aggregate demand  lower interest rates  at least if the monetary impact is larger  and growing private and  public sectors 
6,368,  Tight monetary policy tight fiscal policy  Interest rates rise  at least if the monetary  impact on interest rates is larger  and reduce private demand  At the same time higher  taxes and falling government spending lead to a drop in aggregate demand from both  public and private sectors 
7,368,     Factors Influencing the Mix of Fiscal and Monetary Policy
8,368,Although governments are concerned about stabilizing the level of aggregate demand at close to  the full employment level they are also concerned with the growth of potential output  To this  end encouraging private investment will be important  It may best be achieved by  accommodative monetary policy with low interest rates and a tight fiscal policy to ensure free  resources for a growing private sector 
9,368,At other times the lack of a good quality trained workforce or perhaps a modern capital  infrastructure will be seen as an impediment to growth  thus an expansion in government  spending in these areas may be seen as a high priority  If taxes are not raised to pay for this  then the fiscal stance will be expansionary  If a loose monetary policy is chosen to accompany  this expansionary spending then it is possible that inflation may be induced  Of course it is an  open question as to whether policymakers can judge the appropriate levels of interest rates or  fiscal spending levels 
10,368,Clearly the mix of policies will be heavily influenced by the political context  A weak  government may raise spending to accommodate the demands of competing vested interests   e g  subsidies to particular sectors such as agriculture in the EC  and thus a restrictive  monetary policy may be needed to hold back the possibly inflationary growth in aggregate  demand through raised interest rates and less credit availability 
11,368,Both fiscal and monetary policies suffer from lack of precise knowledge of where the economy  is today because data appear initially subject to revision and with a time lag  However fiscal  policy suffers from two further issues with regard to its use in the short run

2,369,As we saw earlier it is difficult to implement quickly because spending on capital projects takes  time to plan procure and put into practice  In addition it is politically easier to loosen fiscal  policy than to tighten it  in many cases automatic stabilizers are the source of fiscal tightening  because tax rates are not changing and political opposition is muted  Similarly the  independence of many central banks means that decisions on raising interest rates are outside  the hands of politicians and thus can be taken more easily 
3,369,The interaction between monetary and fiscal policies was also implicitly evident in our  discussion of Ricardian equivalence because if tax cuts have no impact on private spending as  individuals anticipate future higher taxes then clearly this may lead policymakers to favour  monetary tools 
4,369,Ultimately the interaction of monetary and fiscal policies in practice is an empirical question  which we touched on earlier  In their detailed research paper using the IMF S Global Integrated  Monetary and Fiscal Model  IMF       IMF researchers examined four forms of coordinated  global fiscal loosening over a two year period which will be reversed gradually after the two  years are completed  These are 
5,369,  an increase in social transfers to all households
6,369,  a decrease in tax on labour income
7,369,  a rise in government investment expenditure and
8,369,  a rise in transfers to the poorest in society 
9,369,The two types of monetary policy responses considered are 
10,369,  no monetary accommodation so rising aggregate demand leads to higher interest rates  immediately  or
11,369,  interest rates are kept unchanged  accommodative policy  for the two years 
12,369,The following important policy conclusions from this study emphasize the role of policy  interactions 
13,369,  No monetary accommodation  Government spending increases have a much bigger effect   six times bigger  on GDP than similar size social transfers because the latter are not  considered permanent although real interest rates rise as monetary authorities react to  rises in aggregate demand and inflation  Targeted social transfers to the poorest citizens  have double the effect of the non targeted transfers while labour tax reductions have a  slightly bigger impact than the latter 
14,369,  Monetary accommodation  Except for the case of the cut in labour taxes fiscal  multipliers are now much larger than when there is no monetary accommodation  The  cumulative multiplier  i e  the cumulative effect on real GDP over the two years divided  by the percentage of GDP which is a fiscal stimulus  is now     for government  expenditure compared to     with no monetary accommodation  The corresponding  numbers for targeted social transfer payments are     without monetary accommodation  and     with it  The larger multiplier effects with monetary accommodation result from  rises in aggregate demand and inflation leading to falls in real interest rates and  additional private sector spending  e g  on investment goods   Labour tax cuts are less  positive

2,370,     Quantitative Easing and Policy Interaction
3,370,What about the scenario of zero interest rates and deflation  Fiscal stimulus should still raise  demand and inflation lowering real interest rates and stimulating private sector demand  We  saw earlier that quantitative easing has been a feature of major economies during             This involves the purchase of government or private securities by the central bank from  individuals institutions or banks and substituting central bank balances for those securities   The ultimate aim is that recipients will subsequently increase expenditures lending or  borrowing in the face of raised cash balances and lower interest rates 
4,370,If the central bank purchases government securities on a large scale it is effectively funding the  budget deficit and the independence of monetary policy is an illusion  This so called  printing  of money  is feared by many economists as the monetization of the government deficit  Note  that it is unrelated to the conventional inflation target of central banks such as the Bank of  England  Some economists question whether an independent central bank should engage in  such activity 
5,370,     The Importance of Credibility and Commitment
6,370,The IMF model implies that if governments run persistently high budget deficits real interest  rates rise and crowd out private investment reducing each country s productive potential  As  individuals realize that deficits will persist inflation expectations and longer term interest rates  rise  This reduces the effect of the stimulus by half 
7,370,Further if there is a real lack of commitment to fiscal discipline over the longer term  e g   because of aging populations  and the ratio of government debt to GDP rose by    percentage  points permanently in the United States alone then world real interest rates would rise by       percent leading to a     percent permanent fall in world GDP

5,371,B  rise in transfer benefits 
6,371,C  cut in labour income tax across all income levels 
7,371,Solution to   
8,371,C is correct  If Ricardian equivalence holds then economic agents anticipate that the  consequence of any current tax cut will be future tax rises which leads them to increase  their saving in anticipation of this so that the tax cut has little effect on consumption and  investment decisions  Governments would be forced to use monetary policy to affect the  real economy on the assumption that money neutrality did not hold in the short term 
9,371,Solution to   
10,371,C is correct  With a tight monetary policy real interest rates should rise and reduce  private sector activity which could be at least partially offset by an expansion in  government activity via the loosening of fiscal policy  The net effect however would be  an expansion in the size of the public sector relative to the private sector 
11,371,Solution to   
12,371,A is correct  The study clearly showed that direct spending by the government leads to a  larger impact on GDP than changes in taxes or benefits 
13,371,SUMMARY
14,371,In this reading we have sought to explain the practices of both monetary and fiscal policy  Both  can have a significant impact on economic activity and it is for this reason that financial  analysts need to be aware of the tools of both monetary and fiscal policy the goals of the  monetary and fiscal authorities and most important the monetary and fiscal policy transmission  mechanisms 
15,371,  Governments can influence the performance of their economies by using combinations of  monetary and fiscal policy  Monetary policy refers to central bank activities that are  directed toward influencing the quantity of money and credit in an economy  By contrast  fiscal policy refers to the government s decisions about taxation and spending  The two  sets of policies affect the economy via different mechanisms

2,372,  Money fulfills three important functions  It acts as a medium of exchange provides  individuals with a way of storing wealth and provides society with a convenient unit of  account  Via the process of fractional reserve banking the banking system can create  money 
3,372,  The amount of wealth that the citizens of an economy choose to hold in the form of  money as opposed to for example bonds or equities is known as the demand for  money  There are three basic motives for holding money  transactions related  precautionary and speculative 
4,372,  The addition of   unit of additional reserves to a fractional reserve banking system can  support an expansion of the money supply by an amount equal to the money multiplier  defined as   reserve requirement  stated as a decimal  
5,372,  The nominal rate of interest is comprised of three components  a real required rate of  return a component to compensate lenders for future inflation and a risk premium to  compensate lenders for uncertainty  e g  about the future rate of inflation  
6,372,  Central banks take on multiple roles in modern economies  They are usually the  monopoly supplier of their currency the lender of last resort to the banking sector the  government s bank and bank of the banks and they often supervise banks  Although they  may express their objectives in different ways the overarching objective of most central  banks is price stability 
7,372,  For a central bank to be able to implement monetary policy objectively it should have a  degree of independence from government be credible and be transparent in its goals and  objectives 
8,372,  The ultimate challenge for central banks as they try to manipulate the supply of money to  influence the economy is that they cannot control the amount of money that households  and corporations put in banks on deposit nor can they easily control the willingness of  banks to create money by expanding credit  Taken together this also means that they  cannot always control the money supply  Therefore there are definite limits to the power  of monetary policy 
9,372,  The concept of money neutrality is usually interpreted as meaning that money cannot  influence the real economy in the long run  However by the setting of its policy rate a  central bank hopes to influence the real economy via the policy rate s impact on other  market interest rates asset prices the exchange rate and the expectations of economic  agents 
10,372,  Inflation targeting is the most common monetary policy although exchange rate  targeting is also used particularly in developing economies  Quantitative easing attempts  to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply 
11,372,  Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and revenue raising  taxation  to  impact a number of aspects of the economy  the overall level of aggregate demand in an  economy and hence the level of economic activity  the distribution of income and wealth  among different segments of the population  and hence ultimately the allocation of  resources between different sectors and economic agents

2,373,  The tools that governments use in implementing fiscal policy are related to the way in  which they raise revenue and the different forms of expenditure  Governments usually  raise money via a combination of direct and indirect taxes  Government expenditure can  be current on goods and services or can take the form of capital expenditure for example  on infrastructure projects 
3,373,  As economic growth weakens or when it is in recession a government can enact an  expansionary fiscal policy for example by raising expenditure without an offsetting  increase in taxation  Conversely by reducing expenditure and maintaining tax revenues a  contractionary policy might reduce economic activity  Fiscal policy can therefore play an  important role in stabilizing an economy 
4,373,  Although both fiscal and monetary policy can alter aggregate demand they work through  different channels the policies are therefore not interchangeable and they conceivably  can work against one another unless the government and central bank coordinate their  objectives

14,379,SOLUTIONS
15,379,   B is correct  There is an inverse relationship between the money multiplier and the  reserve requirement  The money multiplier is equal to   divided by the reserve  requirement 
16,379,   A is correct  Precautionary money demand is directly related to GDP  Precautionary  money balances are held to provide a buffer against unforeseen events that might require  money  Precautionary balances tend to rise with the volume and value of transactions in  the economy and therefore rise with GDP 
17,379,   B is correct  When the interest rate on bonds is I  there is an excess supply of money   equal to M    M        Economic agents would seek to buy bonds with their excess  money balances which would force the price of bonds up and the interest rate down to I  
18,379,   A is correct  According to the theory of money neutrality an increase in the money  supply ultimately leads to an increase in the price level and leaves real variables  unaffected in the long run 
19,379,   B is correct  If money were neutral in the short run monetary policy would not be  effective in influencing the economy

2,380,   B is correct  By definition monetarists believe prices may be controlled by manipulating  the money supply 
3,380,   A is correct  The Fisher effect is based on the idea that the real interest rate is relatively  stable  Changes in the nominal interest rate result from changes in expected inflation 
4,380,   A is correct  The Fisher effect implies that changes in the nominal interest rate reflect  changes in expected inflation which is consistent with Nominal interest rate   Real  interest rate   Expected rate of inflation 
5,380,   C is correct  Low levels of inflation has higher economic costs than moderate levels all  else equal  unanticipated inflation has greater costs than anticipated inflation 
6,380,    C is correct  Transfer payment programs represent fiscal not monetary policy 
7,380,    B is correct  The supervision of banks is not a role that all central banks assume  When it  is a central bank s role responsibility may be shared with one or more entities 
8,380,    A is correct  Central bank activities are typically intended to maintain price stability   Concerning choice B note that the transmission channels of monetary policy are not  independent 
9,380,    A is correct  Investment is expected to move inversely with the official policy rate 
10,380,    A is correct  Such action would tend to constrict the money supply and increase interest  rates all else equal 
11,380,    A is correct  The central bank described is target independent because it set its own  targets  e g  the target inflation rate  and operationally independent because it decides  how to achieve its targets  e g  the time horizon  
12,380,    A is correct  Interest rates are expected to rise to protect the exchange rate target 
13,380,    C is correct  The purchase of government bonds via open market operations increases  banking reserves and the money supply  it is consistent with an expansionary monetary  policy 
14,380,    A is correct  The neutral rate of interest is that rate of interest that neither stimulates nor  slows down the underlying economy  The neutral rate should be consistent with stable  long run inflation 
15,380,    B is correct  A central bank would decrease an official interest rate to stimulate the  economy  The setting in which an official interest rate is lowered to zero  or even slightly  below zero  without stimulating economic growth suggests that there are limits to  monetary policy 
16,380,    C is correct  Raising reserve requirements should slow money supply growth 
17,380,    C is correct  Deflation poses a challenge to conventional monetary policy because once  the central bank has cut nominal interest rates to zero  or slightly less than zero  to  stimulate the economy they cannot cut them further 
18,380,    A is correct  The inability to determine exactly the neutral rate of interest does not  necessarily limit the power of monetary policy

2,381,    A is correct  Public financing of a power plant could be described as a fiscal policy tool to  stimulate investment 
3,381,    C is correct  Ensuring stable purchasing power is a goal of monetary rather than fiscal  policy  Fiscal policy involves the use of government spending and tax revenue to affect  the overall level of aggregate demand in an economy and hence the level of economic  activity 
4,381,    A is correct  Monetary actions may face fewer delays to taking action than fiscal policy  especially when the central bank is independent 
5,381,    B is correct  Cyclically adjusted budget deficits are appropriate indicators of fiscal policy   These are defined as the deficit that would exist if the economy was at full employment   or full potential output  
6,381,    B is correct  Fiscal policy is subject to recognition action and impact lags 
7,381,    C is correct  A freeze in discretionary government spending is an example of a  contractionary fiscal policy 
8,381,    A is correct  A  pay as you go  rule is a neutral policy because any increases in spending  or reductions in revenues would be offset  Accordingly there would be no net impact on  the budget deficit surplus 
9,381,    B is correct  Quantitative easing is an example of an expansionary monetary policy  stance  It attempts to spur aggregate demand by drastically increasing the money supply 
10,381,    B is correct  The belief is that high levels of debt to GDP may lead to higher future tax  rates which may lead to disincentives to economic activity 
11,381,    A is correct  Government borrowing may compete with private sector borrowing for  investment purposes 
12,381,    A is correct  If both fiscal and monetary policies are  easy  then the joint impact will be  highly expansionary leading to a rise in aggregate demand low interest rates and  growing private and public sectors 
13,381,NOTES
14,381, Central banks can implement monetary policy almost completely independent of government interference and  influence at one end of the scale or simply as the agent of the government at the other end of the scale 
15,381, This is an example of a voluntary reserve requirement because it is self imposed 
16,381, This quantity known as the simple money multiplier represents a maximum expansion  To the extent that banks  hold excess reserves or that money loaned out is not re deposited the money expansion would be less  More  complex multipliers incorporating such factors are developed in more advanced texts 
17,381, Note that the full version of the quantity theory of money uses the symbol T rather than Y to indicate transactions  because money is used not just for buying goods and services but also for financial transactions  We will return to  this point in the discussion of quantitative easing 
18,381, See Goodhart        for a discussion

2,384,   INTRODUCTION
3,384,Global investors must address two fundamentally interrelated questions  where to invest and in what  asset classes  Some countries may be attractive from an equity perspective because of their strong  economic growth and the profitability of particular domestic sectors or industries  Other countries  may be attractive from a fixed income perspective because of their interest rate environment and  price stability  To identify markets that are expected to provide attractive investment opportunities  investors must analyze cross country differences in such factors as expected GDP growth rates  monetary and fiscal policies trade policies and competitiveness  From a longer term perspective  investors also need to consider such factors as a country s stage of economic and financial market  development demographics quality and quantity of physical and human capital  accumulated  education and training of workers  and its area s  of comparative advantage  
4,384,This reading provides a framework for analyzing a country s trade and capital flows and their  economic implications  International trade can facilitate economic growth by increasing the  efficiency of resource allocation providing access to larger capital and product markets and  facilitating specialization based on comparative advantage  The flow of financial capital  funds  available for investment  between countries with excess savings and those where financial capital is  scarce can increase liquidity raise output and lower the cost of capital  From an investment  perspective it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of international trade and  capital flows because investment opportunities are increasingly exposed to the forces of global  competition for markets capital and ideas 
5,384,This reading is organized as follows  Section   defines basic terminology used in the reading and  describes patterns and trends in international trade and capital flows  It also discusses the benefits of  international trade distinguishes between absolute and comparative advantage and explains two  traditional models of comparative advantage  Section   describes trade restrictions and their  implications and discusses the motivation for and advantages of trade agreements  Section    describes the balance of payments and Section   discusses the function and objectives of  international organizations that facilitate trade  A summary of key points and practice problems  conclude the reading

7,384,The following sections describe the role importance and possible benefits and costs of international  trade  Before beginning those discussions we define some basic terminology used in this area

2,385,     Basic Terminology
3,385,The aggregate output of a nation over a specified time period is usually measured as its gross  domestic product or its gross national product  Gross domestic product  GDP  measures the market  value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production  such as labor and capital   located within a country economy during a given period of time generally a year or a quarter  Gross  national product  GNP  however measures the market value of all final goods and services  produced by factors of production  such as labor and capital  supplied by residents of a country  regardless of whether such production takes place within the country or outside of the country  The  difference between a country s GDP and its GNP is that GDP includes and GNP excludes the  production of goods and services by foreigners within that country whereas GNP includes and GDP  excludes the production of goods and services by its citizens outside of the country  Countries that  have large differences between GDP and GNP generally have a large number of citizens who work  abroad  for example Pakistan and Portugal  and or pay more for the use of foreign owned capital in  domestic production than they earn on the capital they own abroad  for example Brazil and Canada    Therefore GDP is more widely used as a measure of economic activity occurring within the country  which in turn affects employment growth and the investment environment 
4,385,Imports are goods and services that a domestic economy  i e  households firms and government   purchases from other countries  For example the US economy imports  purchases  cloth from India  and wine from France  Exports are goods and services that a domestic economy sells to other  countries  For example South Africa exports  sells  diamonds to the Netherlands and China exports  clothing to the European Union  So how are services imported or exported  If a Greek shipping  company transports the wine that the United States imports from France the United States would  classify the cost of shipping as an import of services from Greece and the wine would be classified as  an import of goods from France  Similarly when a British company provides insurance coverage to a  South African diamond exporter Britain would classify the cost of the insurance as an export of  services to South Africa  Other examples of services exported imported include engineering  consulting and medical services 
5,385,The terms of trade are defined as the ratio of the price of exports to the price of imports  representing those prices by export and import price indexes respectively  The terms of trade capture  the relative cost of imports in terms of exports  If the prices of exports increase relative to the prices  of imports the terms of trade have improved because the country will be able to purchase more  imports with the same amount of exports   For example when oil prices increased during            major oil exporting countries experienced an improvement in their terms of trade because  they had to export less oil in order to purchase the same amount of imported goods  In contrast if the  price of exports decreases relative to the price of imports the terms of trade have deteriorated  because the country will be able to purchase fewer imports with the same amount of exports  Because  each country exports and imports a large number of goods and services the terms of trade of a  country are usually measured as an index number  normalized to     in some base year  that  represents a ratio of the average price of exported goods and services to the average price of imported  goods and services  Exhibit   shows the terms of trade reported in Salvatore         A value over   under      indicates that the country or group of countries experienced better  worse  terms of  trade relative to the base year of

8,386,As an example Exhibit   indicates that from      to      both of the broader groups developing  and industrial countries experienced a slight decline in their terms of trade  Looking at the  disaggregated data indicates that developing countries in Asia and the Western hemisphere  experienced a considerable decline in terms of trade while those in Europe and the Middle East   which benefited from rising prices of their petroleum exports  experienced a substantial increase   Africa also experienced a small improvement in its terms of trade during this period 
9,386,Net exports is the difference between the value of a country s exports and the value of its imports   i e  value of exports minus imports   If the value of exports equals the value of imports then trade is  balanced  If the value of exports is greater  less  than the value of imports then there is a trade  surplus  deficit   When a country has a trade surplus it lends to foreigners or buys assets from  foreigners reflecting the financing needed by foreigners running trade deficits with that country   Similarly when a country has a trade deficit it has to borrow from foreigners or sell some of its  assets to foreigners  Section   on the balance of payments explains these relationships more fully 
10,386,Autarky is a state in which a country does not trade with other countries  This means that all goods  and services are produced and consumed domestically  The price of a good or service in such an  economy is called its autarkic price  An autarkic economy is also known as a closed economy because it does not trade with other countries  An open economy in contrast is an economy that  trades with other countries  If there are no restrictions on trade then members of an open economy  can buy and sell goods and services at the price prevailing in the world market the world price  An  open economy can provide domestic households with a larger variety of goods and services give  domestic companies access to global markets and customers and offer goods and services that are  more competitively priced  In addition it can offer domestic investors access to foreign capital  markets foreign assets and greater investment opportunities  For capital intensive industries such as  automobiles and aircraft manufacturers can take advantage of economies of scale because they have  access to a much larger market  Free trade occurs when there are no government restrictions on a  country s ability to trade  Under free trade global aggregate demand and supply determine the  equilibrium quantity and price of imports and exports  Government policies that impose restrictions  on trade such as tariffs and quotas  discussed later in the reading  are known as trade protection and prevent market forces  demand and supply  from determining the equilibrium price and quantity  for imports and exports  According to Deardorff globalization refers to the  increasing worldwide  integration of markets for goods services and capital that began to attract special attention in the late      s    It also references  a variety of other changes that were perceived to occur at about the same  time such as an increased role for large corporations  multinational corporations  in the world  economy and increased intervention into domestic policies and affairs by international institutions   such as the International Monetary Fund the World Trade Organization and the World Bank

2,387,The levels of aggregate demand and supply and the quantities of imports and exports in an economy  are related to the concepts of excess demand and excess supply  Exhibit   shows supply and demand  curves for cars in the United Kingdom  E is the autarkic equilibrium at price PA and quantity QA with  the quantity of cars demanded equaling the quantity supplied  Now consider a situation in which the  country opens up to trade and the world price is P   At this price the quantity demanded domestically  is QK while the quantity supplied is QJ  Hence excess demand is QJ QK  This quantity is satisfied by  imports  For example at a world price of        the quantity of cars demanded in the United  Kingdom might be   million and UK production of cars only     million  As a result the excess  demand of        would be satisfied by imports  Returning to Exhibit   now consider a situation in  which the world price is P   The quantity demanded is QC while the quantity supplied is QD  Hence  the domestic excess supply at world price P  is QC QD which results in exports of QC QD

5,388, When exports are concentrated in labor intensive manufacturing trade increases the  wages for unskilled workers benefiting poor people  It also encourages macroeconomic  stability again benefiting the poor who are more likely to be hurt by inflation  And  through innovation and factor accumulation it enhances productivity and thus growth   There may be some empirical uncertainty about the strength of trade s relationship with  growth  But essentially all rich and emerging economies have a strong trade orientation

9,390,The increasing importance of multinational corporations is also apparent in Exhibit    Net FDI  inflows and outflows increased as a percentage of GDP between      and      for each of the  countries shown  Trade between multinational firms and their subsidiaries  i e  intra firm trade  has  become an important part of world trade  For example    percent of US imports occur between  related parties  Bernard Jensen Redding and Schott        Globalization of production has  increased the productive efficiency of manufacturing firms because they are able to decompose their  value chain into individual components or parts and then outsource their production to different  locations where these components can be produced most efficiently   For example Nintendo s Wii  remote is manufactured with components sourced from several locations around the world  the  accelerometer is manufactured in the United States  the base memory chip in Italy  the data converter  in the United States Thailand and India  the plastic casing is assembled in China and designed in  Japan  the Bluetooth chip is manufactured in Taiwan and designed in California  US   and the rumble  pack is manufactured in various locations in Asia   Foreign direct investment and outsourcing have  increased business investment in these economies and provided smaller and less developed  economies the opportunity to participate in international trade  For example the World Investment  Report        indicates that in January      Intel had    fabrication plants and    assembly and  testing sites in   countries regions  It was the leading national exporter from Ireland Philippines and  Costa Rica and   th among foreign exporters from China  These trends indicate the increasing  global interdependence of economies although the degree of interdependence varies  Greater  interdependence also means that economies are now more exposed to global competition  As a result  they must be more flexible in their production structure in order to respond effectively to changes in  global demand and supply 
10,390,The complexity of trading relationships has also increased with the development of sophisticated  global supply chains that include not only final goods but also intermediate goods and services   Increased global interdependence has changed the risk and return profiles of many economies   Economies that have greater international links are more exposed to and affected by economic  downturns and crises occurring in other parts of the world  The contagion effect of the Asian  financial crisis which began in Thailand in July      spread to many other markets such as  Indonesia Malaysia South Korea Philippines Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan  It even affected  Brazil and Russia to some degree although there is less clarity about the mechanisms by which the  crisis spread beyond Asia  Among the outward symptoms of the crisis were exchange rate problems  such as currency speculation and large depreciation of currencies capital flight and financial and  industrial sector bankruptcies  However recovery was surprisingly swift and all these economies  exhibited positive growth by the second quarter of       Gerber

2,391,     Benefits and Costs of International Trade
3,391,The preceding sections have described the growth of world trade and the increasing interdependence  of national economies  Has trade been beneficial  The benefits and costs of international trade have  been widely debated  The most compelling arguments supporting international trade are  countries  gain from exchange and specialization industries experience greater economies of scale households  and firms have greater product variety competition is increased and resources are allocated more  efficiently 
4,391,Gains from exchange occur when trade enables each country to receive a higher price for its exports   and greater profit  and or pay a lower price for imported goods instead of producing these goods  domestically at a higher cost  i e  less efficiently   This exchange in turn leads to a more efficient  allocation of resources by increasing production of the export good and reducing production of the  import good in each country  trading partner   This efficiency allows consumption of a larger bundle  of goods thus increasing overall welfare  The fact that trade increases overall welfare does not of  course mean that every individual consumer and producer is better off  What it does mean is that the  winners could in theory compensate the losers and still be better off 
5,391,Trade also leads to greater efficiency by fostering specialization based on comparative advantage   Traditional trade models such as the Ricardian model and the Heckscher Ohlin model focus on  specialization and trade according to comparative advantage arising from differences in technology  and factor endowments respectively  These models will be discussed in the next section 
6,391,Newer models of trade focus on the gains from trade that result from economies of scale greater  product variety and increased competition  In an open economy increased competition from foreign  firms reduces the monopoly power of domestic firms and forces them to become more efficient as  compared to a closed economy  Industries that exhibit increasing returns to scale  for example the  automobile and steel industries  benefit from increased market size as a country starts trading  because the average cost of production declines as output increases in these industries   Monopolistically competitive models of trade have been used to explain why there is significant two  way trade  known as intra industry trade  between countries within the same industry  Intra industry  trade occurs when a country exports and imports goods in the same product category or  classification 
7,391,In a monopolistically competitive industry there are many firms  each firm produces a unique or  differentiated product there are no exit or entry barriers and long run economic profits are zero  In  such a model even though countries may be similar they gain from trade because each country  focuses on the production and export of one or more varieties of the good and imports other varieties  of the good  For example the European Union exports and imports different types of cars   Consumers gain from having access to a greater variety of final goods  Firms benefit from greater  economies of scale because firms both within and outside the EU are able to sell their goods in both  markets  Hence scale economies allow firms to benefit from the larger market size and experience  lower average cost of production as a result of trade

2,392,Research suggests that trade liberalization can lead to increased real  that is inflation adjusted  GDP  although the strength of this relationship is still debated  The positive influence of trade on GDP can  arise from more efficient allocation of resources learning by doing higher productivity knowledge  spillovers and trade induced changes in policies and institutions that affect the incentives for  innovation   In industries where there is  learning by doing  such as the semiconductor industry the  cost of production per unit declines as output increases because of expertise and experience acquired  in the process of production  Trade can lead to increased exchange of ideas freer flow of technical  expertise and greater awareness of changing consumer tastes and preferences in global markets  It  can also contribute to the development of higher quality and more effective institutions and policies  that encourage domestic innovation  For example Coe and Helpman        show that foreign  research and development  R D  has beneficial effects on domestic productivity  These effects  become stronger the more open an economy is to foreign trade  They estimate that about a quarter of  the benefits of R D investment in a G   country accrues to their trading partners   Hill         discusses the case of Logitech a Swiss company that manufactures computer mice  In order to win  original equipment manufacturer  OEM  contracts from IBM and Apple Logitech needed to develop  innovative designs and provide high volume production at a low cost  So in the late     s they  moved to Taiwan which had a highly qualified labor force competent parts suppliers a rapidly  expanding local computer industry and offered Logitech space in a science park at a very  competitive rate  Soon thereafter Logitech was able to secure the Apple contract 
3,392,Opponents of free trade point to the potential for greater income inequality and the loss of jobs in  developed countries as a result of import competition  As a country moves toward free trade there  will be adjustments in domestic industries that are exporters as well as those that face import  competition  Resources  investments  may need to be reallocated into or out of an industry depending  on whether that industry is expanding  exporters  or contracting  i e  facing import competition   As  a result of this adjustment process less efficient firms may be forced to exit the industry which may  in turn lead to higher unemployment and the need for displaced workers to be retrained for jobs in  expanding industries  The counter argument is that although there may be short term and even some  medium term costs these resources are likely to be more effectively  re  employed in other  industries in the long run  Nonetheless the adjustment process is virtually certain to impose costs on  some groups of stakeholders  For example the US textile industry has undergone significant changes  over the past    years as a result of competition from lower priced imports produced in developing  countries including increased outsourcing of production by US firms  Example   discusses recent  developments and projections for future employment in the industry

2,393,The US Textile Industry
3,393,According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  the textile textile product and apparel  manufacturing industry is very labor intensive and faces strong import competition  Changing  trade regulations have a big impact on employment in this industry  In      members of the  World Trade Organization terminated the Multi Fiber Agreement that imposed quotas for  apparel and textile products  This agreement included most US trading partners and in  particular China  The expiration of quotas in      has allowed more apparel and textile  products to be imported into the United States  Although some bilateral quotas have been re  imposed between the United States and China imports have increased substantially  The low  skilled labor intensive parts of the industry such as fabric for apparel have lost many jobs as  firms shift their operations to countries with very cheap labor costs  The more skill intensive  jobs such as design jobs and custom or high end items that are produced domestically have  not been as adversely affected by trade  Firms in the highly automated and innovative sectors  of the industry such as industrial fabrics carpets and specialty yarns are competitive on a  global scale and it is expected that they will increase their exports as a result of the  liberalization of trade in textiles 
4,393,The BLS estimates in Exhibit   indicate that in      there were        wage and salary  workers in the textile textile product and apparel manufacturing industries  California  Georgia and North Carolina together accounted for about    percent of these workers  The  BLS also estimates that there will be a      percent decline in employment in this sector  between      and       Increased labor productivity and foreign competition will both  continue to contribute to this trend

2,394,The segment of the industry that remains in the United States has responded to competitive  pressures by adopting new and more advanced technologies and becoming very labor  efficient  Advanced technology includes computers and computer controlled equipment that  aid in many functions such as design pattern making and cutting wider looms and the use  of robotics to move material within the plant  All these initiatives are boosting productivity  providing workers with increased training and new skills and changing the nature of work in  the industry  Among the domestic industry s advantages are its proximity to the domestic  market and its ability to respond to fashion trends more rapidly than foreign competitors  The  domestic industry is also better positioned to participate in retailers  move to just in time  inventory management systems and electronic data exchange systems 
3,394,   What are the key changes in trade policy that affected the US textile textile product  and apparel manufacturing industry 
4,394,   How did increased import competition affect the US industry 
5,394,Solution to   
6,394,The Multi Fiber Agreement that imposed quotas for apparel and textile products came to an  end in       This affected trade with most US trading partners and in particular China  The  expiration of quotas in      has allowed more apparel and textile products to be imported  into the United States  Although some bilateral quotas have been re imposed between the  United States and China imports have increased substantially 
7,394,Solution to   
8,394,One of the main impacts was that many low skilled workers lost their jobs as firms moved  production out of the United States to lower wage countries  The effect on more skill  intensive jobs such as those involved with design and domestically produced custom and  high end items has been less severe  The highly automated and innovative sectors of the  industry such as industrial fabrics carpets and specialty yarns are competitive on a global  scale  The industry has responded to competitive pressures by adopting new and advanced  technologies and becoming very labor efficient

2,395,Solution to   
3,395,The lumber industry in Lumberland would benefit from trade  Because the cost of producing  lumber relative to producing cotton is lower in Lumberland than in Cottonland  i e  lumber is  relatively cheap in Lumberland  Lumberland will export lumber and the industry will  expand 
4,395,Solution to   
5,395,The lumber industry in Cottonland would not benefit from trade at least in the short run   Because lumber is relatively expensive to produce in Cottonland the domestic lumber  industry will shrink as lumber is imported from Lumberland 
6,395,Solution to   
7,395,The overall welfare effect in both countries is positive  However in the short run many  lumber producers in Cottonland  and cotton producers in Lumberland  are likely to find  themselves without jobs as the lumber industry in Cottonland and the cotton industry in  Lumberland contract  Those with skills that are also needed in the other industry may find  jobs fairly quickly  Others are likely to do so after some re training  In the long run displaced  workers should be able to find jobs in the expanding export industry  However those who  remain in the import competing industry may be permanently worse off because their  industry specific skills are now less valuable  Thus even in the long run trade does not  necessarily make every stakeholder better off  But the winners could compensate the losers  and still be better off so the overall welfare effect of opening trade is positive 
8,395,Solution to   
9,395,Gains from trade imply that the overall benefits of trade outweigh the losses from trade  It  does not mean that all stakeholders  producers consumers government  benefit  or benefit  equally  from trade 
10,395,Solution to   
11,395,Some of the benefits from trade include  gains from exchange and specialization based on  relative cost advantage  gains from economies of scale as the companies add new markets for  their products  greater variety of products available to households and firms  greater  efficiency from increased competition  and more efficient allocation of resources 
12,395,     Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade
13,395,Up to this point we have not been precise about what it means for a country to have a comparative  advantage in the production of specific goods and services  In this section we define comparative  advantage distinguish it from the notion of absolute advantage and demonstrate the gains from  trading in accordance with comparative advantage  We then explain two traditional models of  trade the Ricardian and Heckscher Ohlin models and the source of comparative advantage in  each model

2,396,       Gains from Trade  Absolute and Comparative Advantage
3,396,A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good  or service  if it is able to produce that  good at a lower cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading partner  For example  suppose a worker in Brazil can produce either    pens or    pencils in a day  A worker in China can  produce either    pens or    pencils  A Chinese worker produces    pencils a day while a Brazilian  worker produces only    pencils a day  Hence China produces pencils at a lower cost than Brazil  and has an absolute advantage in the production of pencils  Similarly Brazil produces pens at a lower  cost than China and hence has an absolute advantage in the production of pens  A country has a  comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of producing that good is less  than that of its trading partner  In our example the opportunity cost of producing an extra pen in  China is   pencils  It is the opportunity foregone  namely the number of pencils China would have to  give up to produce an extra pen  If Brazil does not trade and has to produce both pens and pencils it  will have to give up   pencils in order to produce a pen  Similarly in China each pen will cost    pencils  Hence the opportunity cost of a pen in Brazil is   pencils whereas in China it is   pencils   Brazil has the lower opportunity cost and thus a comparative advantage in the production of pens   China has a lower opportunity cost    pencil costs  th of a pen  than Brazil    pencil costs   a pen   in the production of pencils and thus has a comparative advantage in the production of pencils   Example   further illustrates these concepts

2,397,Solution to  A 
3,397,The United Kingdom has an absolute advantage in the production of machinery because it  produces more machinery per worker per day than India 
4,397,Solution to  B 
5,397,India has an absolute advantage in the production of cloth because it produces more cloth per  worker per day than the United Kingdom 
6,397,Solution to  A and  B 
7,397,In both cases the answer is  yes   In the case of machinery the opportunity cost of a machine  in the United Kingdom is   yards of cloth        or   machine     yards cloth   This amount  is the autarkic price of machines in terms of cloth in the United Kingdom  In India the  opportunity cost of a machine is   yards of cloth         or   machine     yards cloth   Thus  the United Kingdom has a comparative advantage in producing machines  In contrast the  opportunity cost of a yard of cloth in the United Kingdom and in India is   and   of a  machine respectively  India has a lower opportunity cost     of a machine  and therefore a  comparative advantage in the production of cloth 
8,397,   
9,397,   
10,397,   
11,397,It is important to note that even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in producing any of  the goods it can still gain from trade by exporting the goods in which it has a comparative  advantage  In Example   if India could produce only   yards of cloth per day instead of    yards of  cloth the United Kingdom would have an absolute advantage in both machines and cloth  However  India would still have a comparative advantage in the production of cloth because the opportunity  cost of a yard of cloth in India   of a machine in this case would still be less than the opportunity  cost of a yard of cloth in the United Kingdom     of a machine as before  
12,397,   
13,397,   
14,397,Let us now illustrate the gains from trading according to comparative advantage  In Example   if the  United Kingdom could sell a machine for more than   yards of cloth and if India could purchase a  machine for less than   yards of cloth both countries would gain from trade  Although it is not  possible to determine the exact world price without additional details regarding demand and supply  conditions both countries would gain from trade as long as the world price for machinery in terms of  cloth is between the autarkic prices of the trading partners  In our example this price corresponds to  a price of between   and   yards of cloth for a machine  The further away the world price of a good  or service is from its autarkic price in a given country the more that country gains from trade  For  example if the United Kingdom was able to sell a machine to India for   yards of cloth  i e  closer to  India s autarkic price  it would gain   yards of cloth per machine sold to India compared with its  own autarkic price  with no trade  of   machine for   yards of cloth  However if the United  Kingdom was able to sell a machine to India for only   yards of cloth  closer to the UK autarkic  price  it would gain only   yard of cloth per machine sold to India compared with its own autarkic  price 
15,397,Exhibits   and   provide the production and consumption schedules of both countries at autarky and  after trade has commenced  In autarky  Exhibit    the United Kingdom produces and consumes      machines and     yards of cloth  without trade consumption of each product must equal domestic  production   Similarly India produces     machines and     yards of cloth in autarky  In a world  economy consisting of only these two countries total output for each commodity is the sum of  production in both countries  Therefore total world output is     machines and      yards of cloth

5,399,Exhibit    shows a more general case of gains from trade under increasing costs  In Panel A the  curve connecting the X and Y axes is the UK production possibilities frontier  PPF    That is it  represents the combinations of cloth and machinery that the United Kingdom can produce given its  technology and resources  capital and labor   The slope of the PPF at any point is the opportunity  cost of one good in terms of the other  The shape of the PPF indicates increasing opportunity cost in  terms of machines as more cloth is produced and vice versa  To maximize the value of output  production occurs where the slope of the PPF equals the relative price of the goods  PA represents the  autarkic price line which is tangent to the PPF at A the autarkic equilibrium  The slope of the  autarkic price line represents the opportunity cost before trade  In autarky the United Kingdom  produces and consumes    machines and    thousand yards cloth and is on indifference curve I   When the United Kingdom starts trading with India it faces the world price line P   This new price  line is tangent to the PPF at B  The change in relative prices of the goods encourages the United  Kingdom to increase the production of the good in which it has comparative advantage  machines   and produce at B instead of A  We note that at B the United Kingdom has increased the production of  machines to     units and reduced the production of cloth to    thousand yards  We also note that  trade has expanded the UK consumption possibilities  The United Kingdom consumes at point E after trade exports    machines to India and imports    thousand yards of cloth from India  Note that  E is outside the PPF but on the world price line that is tangent to the PPF at B  This line is also the  trading possibilities line because trade occurs along this line  The slope of this line is the opportunity  cost of a machine in terms of cloth in the world market  The United Kingdom has clearly increased  its welfare through trade because it is able to consume at point E which is on a higher indifference  curve  III  and thus represents a higher level of welfare compared with the autarkic consumption  point A on indifference curve I 
6,399,Panel B shows the corresponding situation for India  When trade opens with the United Kingdom  India shifts production from A  to B  producing more cloth the good in which it has a comparative  advantage and fewer machines  It now exports    thousand yards of cloth to the United Kingdom  and imports    machines from the United Kingdom  India now consumes at E  which is on the world  price line and also on a higher indifference curve III  than the autarkic consumption point  A   on  indifference curve I   Thus by specializing  incompletely as is typically the case with increasing  production costs  in the good in which it has a comparative advantage each country increases its  welfare  We should also note that P  is the price at which trade is balanced  At this relative world  price the export of cloth from India equals the import of cloth into the United Kingdom     thousand  yards  and the export of machines from the United Kingdom equals the imports of machines into  India     machines

2,403,From an investment perspective it is critical for analysts to be able to examine a country s  comparative and absolute advantages and to analyze changes in them  It is also important to  understand changes in government policy and regulations demographics human capital demand  conditions and other factors that may influence comparative advantage and production and trade  patterns  This information can then be used to identify sectors industries within those sectors and  companies within those industries that will benefit 
3,403,       Ricardian and Heckscher Ohlin Models of Comparative Advantage
4,403,A discussion of absolute and comparative advantage and the gains from specialization would be  incomplete without a discussion of two important theories of trade the Ricardian Model and the  Heckscher Ohlin Model  These models are based on cross country differences in technology and in  factor endowments respectively  These theoretical models are based on several assumptions some of  which may not be fully satisfied in the real world  nonetheless they provide extremely useful insights  into the determinants and patterns of trade 
5,403,Adam Smith argued that a country could gain from trade if it had an absolute advantage in the  production of a good  David Ricardo extended Smith s idea of the gains from trade by arguing that  even if a country did not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good it could still gain  from trade if it had a comparative advantage in the production of a good  In the Ricardian model  labor is the only  variable  factor of production  Differences in labor productivity reflecting  underlying differences in technology are the source of comparative advantage and hence the key  driver of trade in this model  A country with a lower opportunity cost in the production of a good has  a comparative advantage in that good and will specialize in its production  In our two country model  if countries vary in size the smaller country may specialize completely but may not be able to meet  the total demand for the product  Hence the larger country may be incompletely specialized  producing and exporting the good in which it has a comparative advantage but still producing  and  consuming  some of the good in which it has a comparative disadvantage  It is important to recognize  that although differences in technology may be a major source of comparative advantage at a given  point in time other countries can close the technology gap or even gain a technological advantage   The shift of information technology services from developed countries to India is an example of  comparative advantage shifting over time    This shift was facilitated by India s growing pool of  highly skilled and relatively low wage labor the development and growth of its telecommunication  infrastructure and government policies that liberalized trade in the     s 
6,403,In the Heckscher Ohlin Model  also known as the factor proportions theory  both capital and labor  are variable factors of production  That is each good can be produced with varying combinations of  labor and capital  According to this model differences in the relative endowment of these factors are  the source of a country s comparative advantage  This model assumes that technology in each  industry is the same among countries but it varies between industries  According to the theory a  country has a comparative advantage in goods whose production is intensive in the factor with which  it is relatively abundantly endowed and would tend to specialize in and export that good  Capital is  relatively more  less  abundant in a country if the ratio of its endowment of capital to labor is greater   less  than that of its trading partner    This scenario means a country in which labor is relatively  abundant would export relatively labor intensive goods and import relatively capital intensive goods   For example because the manufacture of textiles and clothing is relatively labor intensive they are  exported by such countries as China and India where labor is relatively abundant

2,404,Relative factor intensities in production can be illustrated with the following example  In       capital per worker in the Canadian paper industry was C        whereas in the clothing  manufacturing sector it was C         These amounts indicate that manufacturing paper is more  capital intensive than clothing production  Canada trades with Thailand and being relatively capital  abundant compared with Thailand it exports relatively capital intensive paper to Thailand and  imports relatively labor intensive clothing from Thailand 
3,404,Because the Heckscher Ohlin model has two factors of production labor and capital  unlike the  Ricardian model that has only labor  it allows for the possibility of income redistribution through  trade  The demand for an input is referred to as a derived demand because it is derived from the  demand for the product it is used to produce  As a country opens up to trade it has a favorable  impact on the abundant factor and a negative impact on the scarce factor  This result is because trade  causes output prices to change  more specifically the price of the export good increases and the price  of the import good declines  These price changes affect the demand for factors used to produce the  import and export goods and hence affect the incomes received by each factor of production 
4,404,To illustrate this point consider again the opening of trade between the United Kingdom and India in  Exhibit     When trade opened the United Kingdom expanded production of machines which are  assumed to be the capital intensive industry and reduced production of clothing  India did the  opposite  Machines became more expensive relative to clothing in the United Kingdom  line P  is  steeper than line PA   The relative price change along with the shift in output it induces leads to a  redistribution of income from labor to capital in the United Kingdom  The opposite occurs in  India machines become cheaper relative to clothing  line P  is flatter than PA    production shifts  toward clothing and income is redistributed from capital to labor 
5,404,Note that in each country the relatively cheap good and the relatively cheap factor of production  both get more expensive when trade is opened  That raises an interesting question  If free trade  equalizes the prices of goods among countries does it also equalize the prices of the factors of  production  In the simple Heckscher Ohlin world of homogeneous products homogeneous inputs  and identical technologies among countries the answer is yes  The absolute and relative factor prices  are equalized in both countries if there is free trade  In the real world we see that factor prices do not  converge completely even if there is free trade because several assumptions of the models are not  fully satisfied in the real world  Nonetheless it is important to note that with international trade  factor prices display a tendency to move closer together in the long run 
6,404,Changes in factor endowments can cause changes in the patterns of trade and can create profitable  investment opportunities  For example in      Japan had a comparative advantage in unskilled  labor intensive goods such as textiles apparel and leather  Meier        notes that by      Japan  had greatly increased its skilled labor and consequently had a comparative advantage in skill  intensive products especially non electrical machinery 
7,404,It is important to note that technological differences as emphasized in the Ricardian trade model and  differences in factor abundance as emphasized in the Heckscher Ohlin model are both important  drivers of trade  They are complementary not mutually exclusive  Tastes and preferences can also  vary among countries and can change over time leading to changes in trade patterns and trade flows

2,405,Trade restrictions  or trade protection  are government policies that limit the ability of domestic  households and firms to trade freely with other countries  Examples of trade restrictions include  tariffs import quotas voluntary export restraints  VER  subsidies embargoes and domestic content  requirements  Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods  Quotas restrict the  quantity of a good that can be imported into a country generally for a specified period of time  A  voluntary export restraint is similar to a quota but is imposed by the exporting country  An export  subsidy is paid by the government to the firm when it exports a unit of a good that is being  subsidized  The goal here is to promote exports but it reduces welfare by encouraging production  and trade that is inconsistent with comparative advantage  Domestic content provisions stipulate  that some percentage of the value added or components used in production should be of domestic  origin  Trade restrictions are imposed by countries for several reasons including protecting  established domestic industries from foreign competition protecting new industries from foreign  competition until they mature  infant industry argument  protecting and increasing domestic  employment protecting strategic industries for national security reasons generating revenues from  tariffs  especially for developing countries  and retaliation against trade restrictions imposed by  other countries 
3,405,Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners  ability to own domestic assets  and or domestic residents  ability to own foreign assets  Thus in contrast with trade restrictions  which limit the openness of goods markets capital restrictions limit the openness of financial  markets  Sections     through     discuss trade restrictions  Section     briefly addresses capital  restrictions 
4,405,     Tariffs
5,405,Tariffs are taxes that a government levies on imported goods    The primary objective of tariffs is to  protect domestic industries that produce the same or similar goods  They may also aim to reduce a  trade deficit  Tariffs reduce the demand for imported goods by increasing their price above the free  trade price  The economic impact of a tariff on imports in a small country is illustrated in Exhibit      In this context a small country is not necessarily small in size population or GDP  Instead a small  country is one that is a price taker in the world market for a product and cannot influence the world  market price  For example by many measures Brazil is a large country but it is a price taker in the  world market for cars  A large country however is a large importer of the product and can exercise  some influence on price in the world market  When a large country imposes a tariff the exporter  reduces the price of the good to retain some of the market share it could lose if it did not lower its  price  This reduction in price alters the terms of trade and represents a redistribution of income from  the exporting country to the importing country  So in theory it is possible for a large country to  increase its welfare by imposing a tariff if    its trading partner does not retaliate and    the  deadweight loss as a result of the tariff  see below  is smaller than the benefit of improving its terms  of trade  However there would still be a net reduction in global welfare the large country cannot  gain by imposing a tariff unless it imposes an even larger loss on its trading partner 
6,405,In Exhibit    the world price  free trade price  is P   Under free trade domestic supply is Q   domestic consumption is Q  and imports are Q Q   After the imposition of a per unit tariff t the  domestic price increases to Pt which is the sum of the world price and the per unit tariff t  At the  new domestic price domestic production increases to Q  and domestic consumption declines to Q   resulting in a reduction in imports to Q Q  
7,405,The welfare effects can be summarized as follows 
8,405,  Consumers suffer a loss of consumer surplus because of the increase in price    This effect is  represented by areas A   B   C   D in Exhibit

2,408,     Quotas
3,408,A quota restricts the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country generally for a specified  period of time  An import license specifies the quantity that can be imported  For example the  European Union operates a system of annual import quotas for steel producers who are not members  of the World Trade Organization  The      quota was     million tons a year for Kazakhstan  In the  case of Russia the      quota of     million tons per year was a part of an EU Russia agreement    A key difference between tariffs and quotas is that the government is able to collect the revenue  generated from a tariff  This effect is uncertain under a quota  With quotas foreign producers can  often raise the price of their goods and earn greater profits than they would without the quota  These  profits are called quota rents  In Exhibit    if the quota is Q Q  the equivalent tariff that will  restrict imports to Q Q  is t and the domestic price after the quota is Pt  This is the same as the  domestic price after the tariff t was imposed  Area C however is now the quota rent or profits that  are likely to be captured by the foreign producer rather than tariff revenue that is captured by the  domestic government  If the foreign producer or foreign government captures the quota rent C then  the welfare loss to the importing country represented by areas B   D   C in Exhibit    under a  quota is greater than under the equivalent tariff  If the government of the country that imposes the  quota can capture the quota rents by auctioning the import licenses for a fee then the welfare loss  under the quota is similar to that of a tariff represented by areas B   D 
4,408,A voluntary export restraint  VER  is a trade barrier under which the exporting country agrees to  limit its exports of the good to its trading partners to a specific number of units  The main difference  between an import quota and a VER is that the former is imposed by the importer whereas the latter  is imposed by the exporter  The VER allows the quota rent resulting from the decrease in trade to be  captured by the exporter  or exporting country  whereas in the case of an import quota there is  ambiguity regarding who captures the quota rents  Hence a VER results in welfare loss in the  importing country  For example in      the Japanese government imposed VERs on automobile  exports to the United States 
5,408,     Export Subsidies
6,408,An export subsidy is a payment by the government to a firm for each unit of a good that is exported   Its goal is to stimulate exports  But it interferes with the functioning of the free market and may  distort trade away from comparative advantage  Hence it reduces welfare  Countervailing duties are  duties that are levied by the importing country against subsidized exports entering the country  As an  example agricultural subsidies in developed countries notably the EU have been a contentious issue  in trade negotiations with less developed countries and developed countries that are agricultural  exporters such as New Zealand and Australia 
7,408,In the case of an export subsidy the exporter has the incentive to shift sales from the domestic to the  export market because it receives the international price plus the per unit subsidy for each unit of the  good exported  This scenario raises the price in the domestic market by the amount of the subsidy in  the small country case  price before subsidy plus subsidy   In the large country case the world price  declines as the large country increases exports  The net welfare effect is negative in both the large  and small country cases with a larger decline in the large country case  This result is because in the  large country case the decline in world prices implies that a part of the subsidy is transferred to the  foreign country unlike in the small country case

3,410,Thailand a small country has to decide whether to impose a tariff or a quota on the import of  computers  You are considering investing in a local firm that is a major importer of  computers 
4,410,   What will be the impact of a tariff on prices quantity produced and quantity imported  in Thailand  the importing country  
5,410,   If Thailand imposes a tariff what will the impact be on prices in the exporting country 
6,410,   How would a tariff affect consumer surplus producer surplus and government revenue  in Thailand 
7,410,   Explain whether the net welfare effect of a tariff is the same as that of a quota 
8,410,   Which policy a tariff or a quota would be most beneficial to the local importer in  which you may invest and why 
9,410,   If Thailand were to negotiate a VER with the countries from which it imports  computers would this be better or worse than an import quota for the local importing  firm in which you may invest  Why 
10,410,Solution to   
11,410,A tariff imposed by a small country such as Thailand raises the price of computers in the  importing country reduces the quantity imported and increases domestic production 
12,410,Solution to   
13,410,A tariff imposed by a small country would not change the price of computers in the exporting  country 
14,410,Solution to   
15,410,When a small country imposes a tariff it reduces consumer surplus increases producer  surplus and increases government revenue in that country 
16,410,Solution to   
17,410,The quota can lead to a greater welfare loss than a tariff if the quota rents are captured by the  foreign government or foreign firms 
18,410,Solution to   
19,410,A tariff will hurt importers because it will reduce their share of the computer market in  Thailand  The impact of a quota depends on whether the importers can capture a share of the  quota rents  Assuming importers can capture at least part of the rents they will be better off  with a quota

2,411,Solution to   
3,411,The VER would not be better for the local importer than the import quota and would most  likely be worse  Under the VER all of the quota rents will be captured by the exporting  countries whereas with an import quota at least part of the quota rents may be captured by  local importers 
4,411,It is important to understand existing trade policies and the potential for policy changes that may  impact return on investment  Changes in the government s trade policy can affect the pattern and  value of trade and may result in changes in industry structure  These changes may have important  implications for firm profitability and growth because they can affect the goods a firm can  import export change demand for its products impact its pricing policies and create delays through  increased paperwork procurement of licenses approvals and so on  For example changes in import  policies that affect the ability of a firm to import vital inputs for production may increase the cost of  production and reduce firm profitability 
5,411,     Trading Blocs Common Markets and Economic Unions
6,411,There has been a proliferation of trading blocs or regional trading agreements  RTA  in recent years   Important examples of regional integration include the North American Free Trade Agreement   NAFTA  and the European Union  EU   A regional trading bloc is a group of countries that have  signed an agreement to reduce and progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors  of production among the members of the bloc  It may or may not have common trade barriers against  countries that are not members of the bloc 
7,411,There are many different types of regional trading blocs depending on the level of integration that  takes place  Free trade areas  FTA  are one of the most prevalent forms of regional integration in  which all barriers to the flow of goods and services among members have been eliminated  However  each country maintains its own polices against non members  The North American Free Trade  Agreement  NAFTA  among the United States Canada and Mexico is an example of a FTA  A  customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and services among  members but also creating a common trade policy against non members  In      Belgium the  Netherlands and Luxemburg   Benelux   formed a customs union that became a part of the  European Community in       The common market is the next level of economic integration that  incorporates all aspects of the customs union and extends it by allowing free movement of factors of  production among members  The Southern Cone Common Market  MERCOSUR  of Argentina  Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay is an example of a common market    An economic union requires  an even greater degree of integration  It incorporates all aspects of a common market and in addition  requires common economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members  The  European Community became the European Union in       If the members of the economic union  decide to adopt a common currency then it is also a monetary union  For example with the  adoption of the euro    EU member countries also formed a monetary union

13,412,Solution to   
14,412,C is correct  A basic FTA does not entail common external tariffs  A is incorrect  whereas a  common market and an economic union entail integration beyond common external tariffs  B  and D are incorrect  
15,412,Regional integration is popular because eliminating trade and investment barriers among a small  group of countries is easier politically less contentious and quicker than multilateral trade  negotiations under the World Trade Organization  WTO   The WTO is a negotiating forum that deals  with the rules of global trade between nations and where member countries can go to sort out trade  disputes  The latest rounds of trade negotiations launched by the WTO in      at Doha Qatar  included several contentious issues of specific concern to developing countries such as the cost of  implementing trade policy reform in developing countries market access in developed countries for  developing countries  agricultural products and access to affordable pharmaceuticals in developing  countries  After nearly a decade of negotiations very limited progress has been made on the major  issues  Hence it is not surprising to see a renewed interest in bilateral and multilateral trade  liberalization on a smaller scale  Policy coordination and harmonization are also easier among a  smaller group of countries  Regional integration can be viewed as a movement toward freer trade 
16,412,Regional integration results in preferential treatment for members compared with non members and  can lead to changes in the patterns of trade  Member countries move toward freer trade by  eliminating or reducing trade barriers against each other leading to a more efficient allocation of  resources  But regional integration may also result in trade and production being shifted from a  lower cost non member who still faces trade barriers to a higher cost member who faces no trade  barriers  This shift leads to a less efficient allocation of resources and could reduce welfare  Hence  there are two static effects that are direct results of the formation of the customs union  trade creation  and trade diversion

2,413,Trade creation occurs when regional integration results in the replacement of higher cost domestic  production by lower cost imports from other members  For example consider two hypothetical  countries Qualor and Vulcan  Qualor produces    million shirts annually and imports   million  shirts from Vulcan which has a lower cost of production  Qualor has    percent tariffs on imports  from Vulcan  Qualor and Vulcan then agree to form a customs union  Qualor reduces its production  of shirts to   million and now imports    million shirts from Vulcan  The decline in Qualor s  domestic production  from    million to   million shirts  is replaced by importing   million  additional shirts from the low cost producer Vulcan  This scenario represents trade creation  The rest  of the additional imports    million shirts  represent increased consumption by Qualor s consumers  because the price of shirts declines after formation of the custom union 
3,413,Trade diversion occurs when lower cost imports from nonmember countries are replaced with  higher cost imports from members  In the example in the preceding paragraph suppose Qualor  initially imposes a    percent tariff on imports from both Vulcan and Aurelia  Aurelia is the lowest  cost producer of shirts so Qualor initially imports   million shirts from Aurelia instead of from  Vulcan  Qualor and Vulcan then form a customs union which eliminates tariffs on imports from  Vulcan but maintains a    percent tariff on imports from Aurelia  Now trade diversion could occur if  the free trade price on imports from Vulcan is lower than the price on imports from Aurelia  Even  though Aurelia is the lowest cost producer it may be a higher priced source of imports because of  the tariff  If this is the case then Qualor will stop importing from Aurelia a non member and divert  its imports to Vulcan a member of the RTA  Both trade creation and trade diversion are possible in  an RTA  If trade creation is larger than trade diversion then the net welfare effect is positive   However there are concerns that this may not always be the case 
4,413,The benefits ascribed to free trade greater specialization according to comparative advantage  reduction in monopoly power because of foreign competition economies of scale from larger market  size learning by doing technology transfer knowledge spillovers greater foreign investment and  better quality intermediate inputs at world prices also apply to regional trading blocs  In addition  fostering greater interdependence among members of the regional trading bloc reduces the potential  for conflict  Members of the bloc also have greater bargaining power and political clout in the global  economy by acting together instead of as individual countries 
5,413,The      World Development Report points to spillover of growth across borders as one of the main  benefits of regional integration  Collier and O Connell        There is evidence of considerable  spillovers among OECD countries which are highly integrated both as a group and within their own  geographic regions  The long run growth of integrated countries is interconnected because members  have greater access to each other s markets  Strong growth in any RTA country could have a positive  impact on growth in other RTA member countries  RTAs also enhance the benefits of good policy  and lead to convergence in living standards  For example growth spillovers are likely to be much  smaller among Sub Saharan African countries because of a lack of integration arising from  deficiencies in RTAs and inadequate levels of transportation and telecommunications infrastructure   Roberts and Deichmann        estimated what the cumulative loss in real GDP between      and       would have been if Switzerland which is landlocked and fully integrated with both its  immediate neighbors and the world economy had been subject to the same level of spillovers as the  Central African Republic  Under such a scenario Switzerland s GDP per capita in      would have  been     percent lower  The cumulative GDP loss would have been      billion  constant US  dollars       which was the equivalent of     percent of Switzerland s real GDP in

2,414,Although regional integration has many advantages it may impose costs on some groups  For  example there was significant concern in the United States that NAFTA and especially low skilled  labor intensive imports from Mexico could hurt low skilled workers  Adjustment costs arose as  import competition caused inefficient firms to exit the market and the workers in those firms were at  least temporarily unemployed as they sought new jobs  However the surviving firms experienced an  increase in productivity and US consumers benefited from the increase in product varieties imported  from Mexico  Feenstra and Taylor        estimated that the product varieties exported from  Mexico to the United States had grown by an average of     percent a year across all industries  They  estimated that NAFTA imposed private costs of nearly      billion a year in the United States during            but that these costs were offset by an average welfare gain of      billion a year accruing  from increased varieties imported from Mexico  Consumer gains from more varieties of products  continued over time as long as the imports continued while adjustment costs arising from job losses  declined over time  In      the gain from increased product varieties from Mexico was     billion  far exceeding the adjustment costs of      billion    Their analysis concluded 
3,414, Thus the consumer gains from increased product variety when summed over the  years considerably exceed the private loss from displacement  This outcome is  guaranteed to occur because the gains from expanded import varieties occur every year  that the imports are available whereas labor displacement is a temporary phenomenon 
4,414, Feenstra and Taylor      p      
5,414,It is important to recognize however that workers displaced by regional integration may have to  bear long term losses if they are unable to find jobs with wages comparable with the jobs they lost or  they remain unemployed for a long period  For example although import competition was certainly  not the only factor that led to a dramatic contraction of the US automobile industry the impact on  employment in that industry is likely to be permanent and many former autoworkers especially older  workers may never find comparable jobs 
6,414,Concerns regarding national sovereignty especially where big and small nations may be part of the  same bloc have also been an impediment to the formation of FTAs  The proposal for a South Asian  regional bloc has faced challenges regarding India s role because it is one of the biggest economies  in the region 
7,414,Regional integration is important from an investment perspective because it offers new opportunities  for trade and investment  The cost of doing business in a large single regional market is lower and  firms can benefit from economies of scale  However it is important to note that differences in tastes  culture and competitive conditions still exist among members of a trading bloc  These differences  may limit the potential benefits from investments within the bloc  In addition depending on the level  of integration and the safeguards in place problems faced by individual member countries in an RTA  may quickly spread to other countries in the bloc

2,415,There are at least two challenges in the formation of an RTA and in its potential progression from a  free trade area to deeper integration in the form of a customs union common market or economic  union  First cultural differences and historical considerations for example wars and  conflicts may complicate the social political process of integration  Second maintaining a high  degree of economic integration limits the extent to which member countries can pursue independent  economic and social policies  Free trade and mobility of labor and capital tend to thwart policies  aimed at controlling relative prices and or quantities within a country while balance of payments and  fiscal credibility considerations limit the viability of divergent macroeconomic policies  This  situation is especially true in the case of a monetary union because monetary policy is not under the  control of individual countries and currency devaluation revaluation is not available as a tool to  correct persistent imbalances    When persistent imbalances do arise they may lead to a crisis that  spills over to other countries facing similar problems  A recent example is the fear of contagion  caused by the Greek fiscal crisis in       In May      Standard   Poor s reduced the credit ratings  on Greece s government from investment grade to junk status  It also downgraded the government  debt of Spain and Portugal  These countries were suffering from a combination of high government  deficits and slow GDP growth  The credit downgrades increased fears that Greece in particular  would default on its debt and cause economic turmoil not only among the healthier countries in the  EU but also in the United States and Asia  The EU and the International Monetary Fund  IMF   agreed on a USD    billion  EUR    billion  bailout for Greece in May      and provided Ireland  with a financing package of about USD    billion  EUR   billion  in November       As of late       there were continuing concerns about the financial health of Greece Ireland Portugal and  Spain  The EU which created the European Financial Stability Facility  EFSF  in      to help EU  countries in need has been debating the need for an expansion in the scope and financing capacity of  the EFSF

5,415,Bagopia Cropland and Technopia decide to enter into an RTA  In the first stage they decide  to sign a free trade agreement  FTA   After several successful years they decide that it is time  to form a common market 
6,415,   Does an FTA make exporting firms in member countries more attractive as investment  options 
7,415,   How does the common market affect firms doing business in these countries compared  with an FTA 
8,415,Solution to   
9,415,The first stage where there is free movement of goods and services among RTA members is  called a free trade area  It makes exporting firms a more attractive investment proposition  because they are able to serve markets in member countries without the additional costs  imposed by trade barriers 
10,415,Solution to   
11,415,Unlike an FTA a common market allows for free movement of factors of production such as  labor and capital among the member economies  Like an FTA it provides access to a much  larger market and free movement of goods and services  But the common market can create  more profitable opportunities for firms than an FTA by allowing them to locate production in  and purchase components from anywhere in the common market according to comparative  advantage

2,416,     Capital Restrictions
3,416,There are many reasons for governments to restrict inward and outward flow of capital  For example  the government may want to meet some objective regarding employment or regional development or  it may have a strategic or defense related objective  Many countries require approval for foreigners to  invest in their country and for citizens to invest abroad  Control over inward investment by foreigners  results in restrictions on how much can be invested and on the type of industries in which capital can  be invested  For example such strategic industries as defense and telecommunications are often  subject to ownership restrictions  Outflow restrictions can include restrictions on repatriation of  capital interest profits royalty payments and license fees  Citizens are often limited in their ability  to invest abroad especially in foreign exchange scarce economies and there can be deadlines for  repatriation of income earned from any investments abroad 
4,416,Economists consider free movement of financial capital to be beneficial because it allows capital to  be invested where it will earn the highest return  Inflows of capital also allow countries to invest in  productive capacity at a rate that is higher than could be achieved with domestic savings alone and it  can enable countries to achieve a higher rate of growth  Longer term investments by foreign firms  that establish a presence in the local economy can bring in not only much needed capital but also new  technology skills and advanced production and management practices as well as create spillover  benefits for local firms  Investment by foreign firms can also create a network of local suppliers if  they source some of their components locally  Such suppliers may receive advanced training and  spillover benefits from a close working relationship with the foreign firms  On the one hand  increased competition from foreign firms in the market may force domestic firms to become more  efficient  On the other hand it is possible that the domestic industry may be hurt because domestic  firms that are unable to compete are forced to exit the market 
5,416,In times of macroeconomic crisis capital mobility can result in capital flight out of the country  especially if most of the inflow reflects short term portfolio flows into stocks bonds and other liquid  assets rather than foreign direct investment  FDI  in productive assets  In such circumstances capital  restrictions are often used in conjunction with other policy instruments such as fixed exchange rate  targets  Capital restrictions and fixed exchange rate targets are complementary instruments because  in a regime of perfect capital mobility governments cannot achieve domestic and external policy  objectives simultaneously using only standard monetary and fiscal policy tools    By limiting the  free flow of capital capital controls provide a way to exercise control over a country s external  balance whereas more traditional macro policy tools are used to address other objectives

2,417,Modern capital controls were developed by the belligerents in World War I as a method to finance  the war effort  At the start of the war all major powers restricted capital outflows  i e  the purchase  of foreign assets or loans abroad   These restrictions raised revenues by keeping capital in the  domestic economy facilitating the taxation of wealth and producing interest income  Moreover  capital controls helped to maintain a low level of interest rates reducing the government s borrowing  costs on its liabilities  Since WWI controls on capital outflows have been used similarly in other  countries mostly developing nations to generate revenue for governments or to permit them to  allocate credit in the domestic economy without risking capital flight  In broad terms a capital  restriction is any policy designed to limit or redirect capital flows  Such restrictions may take the  form of taxes price or quantity controls or outright prohibitions on international trade in assets   Price controls may take the form of special taxes on returns to international investment taxes on  certain types of transactions or mandatory reserve requirements that is a requirement forcing  foreign parties wishing to deposit money in a domestic bank account to deposit some percentage of  the inflow with the central bank for a minimum period at zero interest  Quantity restrictions on  capital flows may include rules imposing ceilings or requiring special authorization for new or  existing borrowing from foreign creditors  Or there may be administrative controls on cross border  capital movements in which a government agency must approve transactions for certain types of  assets 
3,417,Effective implementation of capital restrictions may entail non trivial administration costs  particularly if the measures have to be broadened to close potential loopholes  There is also the risk  that protecting the domestic financial markets by capital restrictions may postpone necessary policy  adjustments or impede private sector adaptation to changing international circumstances  Most  importantly controls may give rise to negative market perceptions which may in turn make it more  costly and difficult for the country to access foreign funds 
4,417,In a study on the effectiveness of capital controls the International Monetary Fund considered  restrictions on capital outflows and inflows separately    The authors concluded that for restrictions  on capital inflows to be effective  i e  not circumvented  the coverage needs to be comprehensive  and the controls need to be implemented forcefully  Considerable administrative costs are incurred in  continuously extending amending and monitoring compliance with the regulations  Although  controls on inflows appeared to be effective in some countries it was difficult to distinguish the  impact of the controls from the impact of other policies such as strengthening of prudential  regulations increased exchange rate flexibility and adjustment of monetary policy  In the case of  capital outflows the imposition of controls during episodes of financial crisis seems to have  produced mixed results providing only temporary relief of varying duration to some countries while  successfully shielding others  e g  Malaysia  and providing them with sufficient time to restructure  their economies

2,418,Capital Restrictions  Malaysia s Capital  Controls in          
3,418,After the devaluation of the Thai baht in July      Southeast Asia suffered from significant  capital outflows that led to falling local equity and real estate prices and declining exchange  rates  To counter the outflows of capital the IMF urged many of the countries in the region to  increase interest rates thus making their assets more attractive to foreign investors  Higher  interest rates however weighed heavily on the domestic economies  In response to this  dilemma Malaysia imposed capital controls on   September       These controls prohibited  transfers between domestic and foreign accounts eliminated credit facilities to offshore  parties prevented repatriation of investment until   September      and fixed the exchange  rate of the Malaysian ringgit at     per US dollar  In February      a system of taxes on  capital flows replaced the prohibition on repatriation of capital  Although the details were  complex the net effect was to discourage short term capital flows while permitting long term  transactions  By imposing capital controls Malaysia hoped to regain monetary independence  and to be able to cut interest rates without provoking a fall in the value of its currency as  investors avoided Malaysian assets  The imposition of outflow controls indeed curtailed  speculative capital outflows and allowed interest rates to be reduced substantially  At the  same time under the umbrella of the capital controls the authorities pursued bank and  corporate restructuring and achieved a strong economic recovery in      and       With the  restoration of economic and financial stability administrative controls on portfolio outflows  were replaced by a two tier price based exit system in February      which was finally  eliminated in May       Although Malaysia s capital controls did contribute to a stabilization  of its economy they came with long term costs associated with the country s removal from  the MSCI developed equity market index an important benchmark in the institutional asset  management industry and its relegation to the emerging market universe  The Malaysian  market was no longer seen as on par with developed equity markets whose institutional and  regulatory frameworks provide a higher standard of safety for investors  As a consequence it  became more difficult for Malaysia to attract net long term capital inflows  Kawai and

2,419,   THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
3,419,The balance of payments  BOP  is a double entry bookkeeping system that summarizes a  country s economic transactions with the rest of the world for a particular period of time typically a  calendar quarter or year  In this context a transaction is defined as  an economic flow that reflects  the creation transformation exchange or extinction of economic value and involves changes in  ownership of goods and or financial assets the provision of services or the provision of labour and  capital     In other words the BOP reflects payments for exports and imports as well as financial  transactions and financial transfers  Analyzing the BOP is an important element in assessing a  country s macroeconomic environment its monetary and fiscal policies and its long term growth  potential  Investors use data on trade and capital flows to evaluate a country s overall level of capital  investment profitability and risk  The following section describes the balance of payments the  factors that influence it and its impact on exchange rates interest rates and capital market  transactions 
4,419,     Balance of Payments Accounts
5,419,The BOP is a double entry system in which every transaction involves both a debit and credit  In  principle the sum of all debit entries should equal the sum of all credit entries and the net balance of  all entries on the BOP statement should equal zero  In practice however this is rarely the case  because the data used to record balance of payments transactions are often derived from different  sources 
6,419,Debit entries reflect purchases of imported goods and services purchases of foreign financial assets  payments received for exports and payments  interest and principal  received from debtors  Credit  entries reflect payments for imported goods and services payments for purchased foreign financial  assets and payments to creditors  see Exhibit    Panel A   Put differently a debit represents an  increase in a country s assets  the purchase of foreign assets or the receipt of cash from foreigners  or  a decrease in its liabilities  the amount owed to foreigners   a credit represents a decrease in assets   the sale of goods and services to foreigners or the payment of cash to foreigners  or an increase in  liabilities  an amount owed to foreigners  
7,419,For example as shown in Panel B of Exhibit    on   September Country A purchases    million of  goods from Country B and agrees to pay for these goods on   December  On   September Country  A would record in its BOP a    million debit to reflect the value of the goods purchased  i e   increase in assets  and    million credit to reflect the amount owed to Country B  On   December  Country A would record in its BOP a    million debit to reflect a decrease in the amount owed   liability  to Country B and    million a credit to reflect the actual payment to Country B  decrease  in assets  
8,419,From Country B s perspective on   September it would record in its BOP a    million debit to  reflect the amount owed by Country A and a    million credit to reflect the sale of goods  exports    On   December Country B would record a    million debit to reflect the cash received from Country  A and    million credit to reflect the fact that it is no longer owed    million by Country A

3,421,The current account can be decomposed into four sub accounts 
4,421,   Merchandise trade consists of all commodities and manufactured goods bought sold or  given away 
5,421,   Services include tourism transportation engineering and business services such as legal  services management consulting and accounting  Fees from patents and copyrights on new  technology software books and movies are also recorded in the services category 
6,421,   Income receipts include income derived from ownership of assets such as dividends and  interest payments  income on foreign investments is included in the current account because  that income is compensation for services provided by foreign investments  When a German  company builds a plant in China for instance the services the plant generates are viewed as a  service export from Germany to China equal in value to the profits the plant yields for its  German owner 
7,421,   Unilateral transfers represent one way transfers of assets such as worker remittances from  abroad to their home country and foreign direct aid or gifts 
8,421,Capital Account
9,421,The capital account consists of two sub accounts 
10,421,   Capital transfers include debt forgiveness and migrants  transfers  goods and financial assets  belonging to migrants as they leave or enter the country     Capital transfers also include the  transfer of title to fixed assets and the transfer of funds linked to the sale or acquisition of fixed  assets gift and inheritance taxes death duties uninsured damage to fixed assets and legacies 
11,421,   Sales and purchases of non produced non financial assets such as the rights to natural  resources and the sale and purchase of intangible assets such as patents copyrights  trademarks franchises and leases 
12,421,Financial Account
13,421,The financial account can be broken down in two sub accounts  financial assets abroad and foreign  owned financial assets within the reporting country 
14,421,   A country s assets abroad are further divided into official reserve assets government assets  and private assets  These assets include gold foreign currencies foreign securities the  government s reserve position in the International Monetary Fund   direct foreign investment  and claims reported by resident banks 
15,421,   Foreign owned assets in the reporting country are further divided into official assets and other  foreign assets  These assets include securities issued by the reporting country s government  and private sectors  e g  bonds equities mortgage backed securities  direct investment and  foreign liabilities reported by the reporting country s banking sector

2,424,Commercial Exports  Transactions  ia  and  ib 
3,424,A company in Germany sells technology equipment to a South Korean auto manufacturer for a total  price of EUR   million including freight charges of EUR  million to be paid within    days  The  merchandise will be shipped via a German cargo ship  In this case Germany is exporting two assets   equipment and transportation services  The cargo shipped is viewed as being created in Germany and  used by South Korean customers  In return for relinquishing these two assets Germany acquires a  financial asset the promise by the South Korean manufacturer to pay for the equipment in    days 
4,424,Germany would record a EUR   million debit to an account called  private short term claims  to  show an increase in this asset  It would also record a credit of EUR   million to  goods  and another  credit of EUR  million to  services   Both credit entries are listed in the export category and show  the decrease in assets available to German residents  These figures are entered as credits on lines    and   and as a debit on    in Exhibit    and are marked with  ia  to identify a typical commercial  export transaction  To pay for the technology equipment purchased from Germany the South Korean  auto manufacturer may purchase euros from its local bank  i e  a EUR demand deposit held by the  Korean bank in a German bank  and then transfer them to the German exporter  As a result German  liabilities to South Korean residents  i e  South Korean private short term claims  would be debited   The respective entries marked with  ib  are on lines    and    in Exhibit    
5,424,Commercial Imports  Transaction  ii 
6,424,A German utility company imports gas from Russia valued at EUR    million  ii  and agrees to pay  the Russian company within three months  The imported gas generates a debit on line    The  obligation pay is recorded as a credit to foreign private short term claims on line    
7,424,Loans to Borrowers Abroad  Transaction  iii 
8,424,A German commercial bank purchases EUR     million in intermediate term bonds issued by a  Ukrainian steel company  The bonds are denominated in euros so payment is made in euros  i e  by  transferring EUR demand deposits   A debit entry on line    records the increase in German holdings  of Ukrainian bonds and a credit entry on line    records the increase in demand deposits held by  Ukrainians in German banks

32,425,Private foreigners may not wish to retain euro balances acquired in earlier transactions  Those who  are holding foreign currency in our example euro claims typically do so for purposes of financing  purchases from Germany  or other euro area member countries   Assume for instance that Swiss  residents attempt to sell EUR   million in exchange for their native currency the Swiss franc  CHF   but there is a lack of demand for EUR funds in Switzerland  In such circumstances the CHF would  appreciate against the EUR  To prevent an undesired CHF appreciation the Swiss National Bank   SNB  might sell CHF in exchange for EUR balances

2,426,Suppose that the Swiss National Bank purchased EUR   million typically in the form of a EUR  demand deposit held with a German bank from local commercial banks in Switzerland  The German  BOP would register an increase of EUR   million in German liabilities held by foreign monetary  authorities the Swiss National Bank  line     and an equivalent decline in short term liabilities held  by private foreigners  i e  Swiss private investors line      It may be noteworthy that when the SNB  purchases EUR funds from Swiss commercial banks it also credits them the CHF equivalent of  EUR   million  The SNB s liabilities to Swiss commercial banks arising from this transaction are in  fact reserve deposits that Swiss banks can use when they expand their lending business and create  new deposits  Currency interventions by central banks therefore can contribute to an increase in a  country s overall money supply all else remaining unchanged 
3,426,Receipts of Income from Foreign Investments  Transaction  v 
4,426,Each year residents of Germany receive billions of EUR in interest and dividends from capital  invested in foreign securities and other financial claims  German residents receive these payments in  return for allowing foreigners to use German capital that otherwise could be put to work in Germany   Foreign residents in turn receive similar returns for their investments in Germany  Assume that a  German firm has a long term capital investment in a profitable subsidiary abroad and that the  subsidiary transfers to its German parent EUR  million in dividends in the form of funds held in a  foreign bank  The German firm then has a new  or increased  demand deposit in a foreign bank as  compensation for allowing its capital to be used by its subsidiary  A debit entry on line    shows  German private short term claims on foreigners have increased by EUR  million and a credit entry  on line   reflects the fact that German residents have given up an asset  the services of capital  covered over the period  valued at EUR  million 
5,426,Purchase of Non financial Assets  Transaction  vi 
6,426,In a move to safeguard its long term supply of uranium a German utility company purchases the  rights to exploit a uranium mine from the government of Kazakhstan  It agrees to pay within three  months  The respective entries are on lines    and     Because a non financial non produced asset is  involved in this transaction it is recorded in Germany s capital account 
7,426,Note that the sum of all BOP entries in Exhibit    is    Transactions  i   iv  produce a current  account surplus of EUR   million a capital account deficit of EUR    million and a financial  account surplus of EUR   million 
8,426,Although it is important to understand the detailed structure of official balance of payments accounts  as described in the preceding paragraphs this example is not necessarily how investment  professionals think about the balance of payments day to day  Practitioners often think of the current  account as roughly synonymous with the trade balance  merchandise trade   services  and lump all  the financing flows  financial account   capital account  into one category that is usually referred to  simply as the  capital account   They then think of the capital account as consisting of two types of  flows portfolio investment flows and foreign direct investment  FDI   The former are shorter term  investments in foreign assets  stocks bonds etc   whereas the latter are long term investments in  production capacity abroad  Although not completely accurate this way of thinking about the  balance of payments focuses attention on the components trade portfolio flows and FDI that are  most sensitive to and most likely to affect market conditions prices of goods and services asset  prices and exchange rates  In addition this perspective fits well with the role that the balance of  payments plays in the macroeconomy

2,427,In a closed economy all output Y is consumed or invested by the private sector domestic  households and businesses or purchased by the government  Letting Y denote GDP C private  consumption I investment and G government purchases of goods and services the national income  identity for a closed economy is given by 
3,427,Equation    
4,427,Y   C   I   G
5,427,Once foreign trade is introduced however some output is purchased by foreigners  exports  whereas  some domestic spending is used for purchases of foreign goods and services  imports   The national  income identity for an open economy is thus
6,427,Equation    
7,427,Y   C   I   G   X   M
8,427,where X denotes exports and M denotes imports 
9,427,For most countries exports rarely equal imports  Net exports or the difference between exports and  imports  X   M  is the equivalent of the current account balance from a BOP perspective    When a  country s imports exceed its exports the current account is in deficit  When a country s exports  exceed its imports the current account is in surplus  As the right side of Equation   shows a current  account surplus or deficit can affect GDP  and also employment   The balance of the current account  is also important because it measures the size and direction of international borrowing 
10,427,In order for the balance of payments to balance a deficit or surplus in the current account must be  offset by an opposite balance in the sum of the capital and financial accounts  This requirement  means that a country with a current account deficit has to increase its net foreign debts by the amount  of the current account deficit  For example the United States has run current account deficits for  many years while accumulating net foreign liabilities  The current account deficit was financed by  net capital imports  i e  direct investments by foreigners  loans by foreign banks and the sale of US  equities and fixed income securities to foreign investors  By the same token an economy with a  current account surplus is earning more for its exports than it spends for its imports  Japan Germany  and China are traditional current account surplus countries accumulating substantial net foreign  claims especially against the United States  An economy with a current account surplus finances the  current account deficit of its trading partners by lending to them that is granting bank loans and  investing in financial and real assets  As a result the foreign wealth of a surplus country rises  because foreigners pay for imports by issuing liabilities that they will eventually have to redeem 
11,427,By rearranging Equation   we can define the current account balance from the perspective of the  national income accounts as 
12,427,Equation    
13,427,CA   X   M   Y    C   I   G 
14,427,Only by borrowing money from foreigners can a country have a current account deficit and consume  more output than it produces  If it consumes less output than it produces it has a current account  surplus and can  indeed must  lend the surplus to foreigners  International capital flows essentially  reflect an inter temporal trade  An economy with a current account deficit is effectively importing  present consumption and exporting future consumption 
15,427,Let us now turn to the relationship between output Y and disposable income Yd  We have to recognize  that part of income is spent on taxes T and that the private sector receives net transfers R in addition  to  national  income  Disposable income Yd is thus equal to income plus transfers minus taxes

2,428,Equation    
3,428,Yd   Y   R   T
4,428,Disposable income in turn is allocated to consumption and saving so that we can write
5,428,Equation    
6,428,Yd   C   Sp
7,428,where Sp denotes private sector saving  Combining Equations   and   allows us to write  consumption as income plus transfers minus taxes and saving 
8,428,Equation    
9,428,C   Yd   Sp   Y   R   T   Sp
10,428,We can now use the right side of Equation   to substitute for C in Equation    With some  rearrangement we obtain
11,428,Equation    
12,428,CA   Sp   I    T   G   R 
13,428,Because  T   G   R  is taxes minus government spending and transfers it is the government surplus  or put differently government savings Sg  Equation   can therefore be restated as
14,428,Equation    
15,428,Sp   Sg   I   CA
16,428,Equation   highlights an essential difference between open and closed economies  An open economy  can use its saving for domestic investment or for foreign investment  i e  by exporting its savings  and acquiring foreign assets  while in a closed economy savings can only be used for domestic  investment  Put another way an open economy with promising investment opportunities is not  constrained by its domestic savings rate in order to exploit these opportunities  As Equation   shows  it can raise investment by increasing foreign borrowing  a reduction in CA  without increasing  domestic savings  For example if India decides to build a network of high speed trains it can import  all the required materials it needs from France and then borrow the funds perhaps also from France  to pay for the materials  This transaction increases India s domestic investment because the imported  materials contribute to the expansion in the country s capital stock  All else being equal this  transaction will also produce a current account deficit for India by an amount equal to the increase in  investment  India s savings does not have to increase even though investment increases  This  example can be interpreted as an inter temporal trade in which India imports present consumption   when it borrows to fund current expenditure  and exports future consumption  when it repays the  loan  
17,428,Rearranging Equation   we can write
18,428,Equation    
19,428,Sp   I   CA   Sg
20,428,Equation   states that an economy s private savings can be used in three ways      investment in  domestic capital  I      purchases of assets from foreigners  CA  and     net purchases  or  redemptions  of government debt   Sg

2,429,Finally we can rearrange Equation   again to illustrate the macroeconomic sources of a current  account imbalance 
3,429,Equation     
4,429,CA   Sp   Sg   I
5,429,A current account deficit tends to result from low private savings high private investment a  government deficit  Sg      or a combination of the three  Alternatively a current account surplus  reflects high private savings low private investment or a government surplus 
6,429,As outlined above trade deficits can result from a lack of private or government savings or booming  investments  If trade deficits primarily reflect high private or government consumption  i e  scarce  savings   Sp   Sg  the deficit country s capacity to repay its liabilities from future production  remains unchanged  If a trade deficit primarily reflects strong investments  I  however the deficit  country can increase its productive resources and its ability to repay its liabilities 
7,429,We can also see from Equation   that a current account deficit tends to reflect a strong domestic  economy  elevated consumer government and investment spending  which is usually accompanied  by elevated domestic credit demand and high interest rates  In such an environment widening  interest rate differentials vis   vis other countries can lead to growing net capital imports and  produce an appreciating currency  In the long run however a persistent current account deficit leads  to a permanent increase in the claims held by other countries against the deficit country  As a result  foreign investors may require rising risk premiums for such claims a process that appears to lead to a  depreciating currency 
8,429,EXAMPLE

11,429,The UK s budget deficit is the highest in the G     in Europe only Ireland  borrows more  These are the stark facts facing Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne as he plans his first Budget tomorrow  He intends to tackle the  problem even if that involves severe spending cuts and large tax increases

15,429,Solution to   
16,429,The combination of spending cuts and tax increases will all else the same lead to an  improvement in the UK current account position 
17,429,Solution to   
18,429,UK imports are likely to be reduced by tax increases and spending cuts because government  demand for foreign goods will fall and growth in private household income which finances  private imports will be restricted as more household income goes to taxes

4,431,As illustrated in Equation    current account deficits or surpluses reflect imbalances  between national savings  including government savings  and investments  Current account  deficits are often related to expansionary fiscal policy and government deficits  In the     s  for instance the growing deficit in the US current account was widely seen as the  consequence of tax cuts and rising defence spending adopted by the Reagan administration   Since the mid     s however the current account imbalances depicted in Exhibit    appear  to reflect other more complex factors  Exhibit    illustrates US net savings  S I  for private  domestic businesses households and the government  i e  federal state and local  from       to the second quarter of       The exhibit indicates that business sector net savings and  government net savings as a percentage of GDP have been near mirror images since        During the technology bubble businesses invested heavily and ran progressively larger  savings deficits while the government moved to a surplus  After the bubble burst the pattern  reversed with businesses moving to net positive savings and the government fiscal balance  deteriorating sharply  Meanwhile the household sector gradually reduced its savings rate  By       each of the three sectors was dis saving roughly   percent of US GDP  From that point  the public and private sectors diverged sharply  In the wake of the global financial crisis  households and businesses cut spending and increased savings sharply while the government  deficit exploded to more than    percent of GDP

5,432,During the Great Depression in the     s countries attempted to support their failing economies by  sharply raising barriers to foreign trade devaluing their currencies to compete against each other for  export markets and restricting their citizens  freedom to hold foreign exchange  These attempts  proved to be self defeating  World trade declined dramatically and employment and living standards  fell sharply in many countries  By the     s it had become a wide spread conviction that the world  economy was in need of organizations that would help promote international economic cooperation   In July      during the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods New  Hampshire representatives of    governments agreed on a framework for international economic  cooperation  Two crucial multinational organizations emanated from this conference the World  Bank which was founded during the conference and the International Monetary Fund  IMF  which  came into formal existence in December       Although the IMF was founded with the goal to  stabilize exchange rates and assist the reconstruction of the world s international payment system the  World Bank was created to facilitate post war reconstruction and development

2,433,A third institution the International Trade Organization  ITO  was to be created to handle the trade  side of international economic cooperation joining the other two  Bretton Woods  institutions  The  draft ITO charter was ambitious extending beyond world trade regulations to include rules on  employment commodity agreements restrictive business practices international investment and  services  The objective was to create the ITO at a United Nations Conference on Trade and  Employment in Havana Cuba in       Meanwhile    countries had begun negotiations in  December      to reduce and regulate customs tariffs  With World War II only barely ended they  wanted to give an early boost to trade liberalization and begin to correct the legacy of protectionist  measures that had remained in place since the early     s  The group had expanded to    nations by  the time the deal was signed on    October      and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   GATT  was born  The Havana conference began on    November      less than a month after  GATT was signed  The ITO charter was finally approved in Havana in March      but ratification  in some national legislatures proved impossible  The most serious opposition was in the US  Congress even though the US government had been one of the driving forces  In      the United  States government announced that it would not seek congressional ratification of the Havana Charter  and the ITO was effectively dead  As a consequence the GATT became the only multilateral  instrument governing international trade from      until the World Trade Organization  WTO  was  officially established in      
3,433,     International Monetary Fund
4,433,As we saw earlier current account deficits reflect a shortage of net savings in an economy and can be  addressed by policies designed to rein in domestic demand  This approach could however have  adverse consequences for domestic employment  The IMF stands ready to lend foreign currencies to  member countries to assist them during periods of significant external deficits  A pool of gold and  currencies contributed by members provides the IMF with the resources required for these lending  operations  The funds are only lent under strict conditions and borrowing countries  macroeconomic  policies are continually monitored  The IMF s main mandate is to ensure the stability of the  international monetary system the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables  countries to buy goods and services from each other  More specifically the IMF 
5,433,  provides a forum for cooperation on international monetary problems 
6,433,  facilitates the growth of international trade and promotes employment economic growth and  poverty reduction 
7,433,  supports exchange rate stability and an open system of international payments  and
8,433,  lends foreign exchange to members when needed on a temporary basis and under adequate  safeguards to help them address balance of payments problems 
9,433,The global financial crisis of           demonstrated that domestic and international financial  stability cannot be taken for granted even in the world s most developed countries  In light of these  events the IMF has redefined and deepened its operations by   
10,433,  enhancing its lending facilities  The IMF has upgraded its lending facilities to better serve its  members  As part of a wide ranging reform of its lending practices it has also redefined the  way it engages with countries on issues related to structural reform of their economies  In this  context it has doubled member countries  access to fund resources and streamlined its lending  approach to reduce the stigma of borrowing for countries in need of financial help

2,434,  improving the monitoring of global regional and country economies  The IMF has taken  several steps to improve economic and financial surveillance which is its framework for  providing advice to member countries on macroeconomic policies and warning member  countries of risks and vulnerabilities in their economies 
3,434,  helping resolve global economic imbalances  The IMF s analysis of global economic  developments provides finance ministers and central bank governors with a common  framework for discussing the global economy 
4,434,  analyzing capital market developments  The IMF is devoting more resources to the analysis of  global financial markets and their links with macroeconomic policy  It also offers training to  country officials on how to manage their financial systems monetary and exchange regimes  and capital markets 
5,434,  assessing financial sector vulnerabilities  Resilient well regulated financial systems are  essential for macroeconomic stability in a world of ever growing capital flows  The IMF and  the World Bank jointly run an assessment program aimed at alerting countries to  vulnerabilities and risks in their financial sectors 
6,434,From an investment perspective the IMF helps to keep country specific market risk and global  systemic risk under control  The Greek sovereign debt crisis which threatened to destabilize the  entire European banking system is a recent example  In early      the Greek sovereign debt rating  was downgraded to non investment grade by leading rating agencies as a result of serious concerns  about the sustainability of Greece s public sector debt load  Yields on Greek government bonds rose  substantially following the downgrading and the country s ability to refinance its national debt was  seriously questioned in international capital markets  Bonds issued by some other European  governments fell and equity markets worldwide declined in response to spreading concerns of a  Greek debt default  The downgrading of Greek sovereign debt was the ultimate consequence of  persistent and growing budget deficits the Greek government had run before and after the country  had joined the European Monetary Union  EMU  in       Most of the budget shortfalls reflected  elevated outlays for public sector jobs pensions and other social benefits as well as persistent tax  evasion  Reports that the Greek government had consistently and deliberately misreported the  country s official economic and budget statistics contributed to further erosion of confidence in  Greek government bonds in international financial markets  Facing default the Greek government  requested that a joint European Union IMF bailout package be activated and a loan agreement was  reached between Greece the other EMU member countries and the IMF  The deal consisted of an  immediate EUR   billion in loans to be provided in      with more funds available later  A total of  EUR    billion was agreed depending on strict economic policy conditions that included cuts in  wages and benefits an increase in the retirement age for public sector employees limits on public  pensions increases in direct and indirect taxes and a substantial reduction in state owned companies   By providing conditional emergency lending facilities to the Greek government and designing a joint  program with the European Union on how to achieve fiscal consolidation the IMF prevented a  contagious wave of sovereign debt crises in global capital markets 
7,434,Another example of IMF activities is the East Asian Financial Crisis in the late     s  It began in  July      when Thailand was forced to abandon its currency s peg with the US dollar  Currency  devaluation subsequently hit other East Asian countries that had similar balance of payment  problems such as South Korea Malaysia the Philippines and Indonesia  They had run persistent  and increasing current account deficits financed mainly with short term capital imports in particular  domestic banks borrowing in international financial markets  External financing was popular because  of the combination of lower foreign especially US interest rates and fixed exchange rates  Easy  money obtained from abroad led to imprudent investment which contributed to overcapacities in  several industries and inflated prices on real estate and stock markets  The IMF came to the rescue of  the affected countries with considerable loans accompanied by policies designed to control domestic  demand which included fiscal austerity and tightened monetary reins

2,435,     World Bank Group
3,435,The World Bank s main objective is to help developing countries fight poverty and enhance  environmentally sound economic growth  For developing countries to grow and attract business they  have to
4,435,  strengthen their governments and educate their government officials 
5,435,  implement legal and judicial systems that encourage business 
6,435,  protect individual and property rights and honour contracts 
7,435,  develop financial systems robust enough to support endeavours ranging from micro credit to  financing larger corporate ventures  and
8,435,  combat corruption 
9,435,Given these targets the World Bank provides funds for a wide range of projects in developing  countries worldwide and financial and technical expertise aimed at helping those countries reduce  poverty 
10,435,The World Bank s two closely affiliated entities the International Bank for Reconstruction and  Development  IBRD  and the International Development Association  IDA  provide low or no  interest loans and grants to countries that have unfavourable or no access to international credit  markets  Unlike private financial institutions neither the IBRD nor the IDA operates for profit  The  IBRD is market based and uses its high credit rating to pass the low interest it pays for funds on to  its borrowers developing countries  It pays for its own operating costs because it does not look to  outside sources to furnish funds for overhead 
11,435,IBRD lending to developing countries is primarily financed by selling AAA rated bonds in the  world s financial markets  Although the IBRD earns a small margin on this lending the greater  proportion of its income comes from lending out its own capital  This capital consists of reserves  built up over the years and money paid in from the Bank s     member country shareholders   IBRD s income also pays for World Bank operating expenses and has contributed to IDA and debt  relief  IDA is the world s largest source of interest free loans and grant assistance to the poorest  countries  IDA s funds are replenished every three years by    donor countries  Additional funds are  regenerated through repayments of loan principal on    to    year no interest loans which are then  available for re lending  At the end of September      the IBRD had net loans outstanding of  USD      billion while its borrowings amounted to USD    billion 
12,435,Besides acting as a financier the World Bank also provides analysis advice and information to its  member countries to enable them to achieve the lasting economic and social improvements their  people need  Another of the Bank s core functions is to increase the capabilities of its partners  people in developing countries and its own staff  Links to a wide range of knowledge sharing  networks have been set up by the Bank to address the vast need for information and dialogue about  development 
13,435,From an investment perspective the World Bank helps to create the basic economic infrastructure  that is essential for the creation of domestic financial markets and a well functioning financial  industry in developing countries  Moreover the IBRD is one of the most important supranational  borrowers in the international capital markets  Because of its strong capital position and its very  conservative financial liquidity and lending policies it enjoys the top investment grade rating from  the leading agencies and investors have confidence in its ability to withstand adverse events  As a  result IBRD bonds denominated in various major currencies are widely held by institutional and  private investors

2,436,     World Trade Organization
3,436,The WTO provides the legal and institutional foundation of the multinational trading system  It is the  only international organization that regulates cross border trade relationships among nations on a  global scale  It was founded on   January      replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade  GATT  that had come into existence in       The GATT was the only multilateral body  governing international trade from      to       It operated for almost half a century as a quasi  institutionalized provisional system of multilateral treaties  Several rounds of negotiations took place  under the GATT of which the Tokyo round and the Uruguay round may have been the most far  reaching  The Tokyo round was the first major effort to address a wide range of non tariff trade  barriers whereas the Uruguay round focused on the extension of the world trading system into  several new areas particularly trade in services and intellectual property but also to reform trade in  agricultural products and textiles  The GATT still exists in an updated      version and is the  WTO s principal treaty for trade in goods  The GATT and the General Agreement on Trade in  Services  GATS  are the major agreements within the WTO s body of treaties that encompasses a  total of about    agreements annexes decisions and understandings 
4,436,In November      the most recent and still ongoing round of negotiations was launched by the  WTO in Doha Qatar  The Doha round was an ambitious effort to enhance globalization by slashing  barriers and subsidies in agriculture and addressing a wide range of cross border services  So far  under GATS which came into force in January      banks insurance companies  telecommunication firms tour operators hotel chains and transport companies that want to do  business abroad can enjoy the same principles of free and fair trade that had previously applied only  to international trade in goods  No agreement has been reached in Doha so far however despite  intense negotiations at several ministerial conferences and at other sessions  The Doha round  nevertheless marks one of the most crucial events in global trade over the past several decades   China s accession to the WTO in December      
5,436,The WTO s most important functions are the implementation administration and operation of  individual agreements  acting as a platform for negotiations  and settling disputes  Moreover the  WTO has the mandate to review and propagate its members  trade policies and ensure the coherence  and transparency of trade policies through surveillance in a global policy setting  The WTO also  provides technical cooperation and training to developing least developed and low income  countries to assist with their adjustment to WTO rules  In addition the WTO is a major source of  economic research and analysis producing ongoing assessments of global trade in its publications  and research reports on special topics  Finally the WTO is in close cooperation with the other two  Bretton Woods institutions the IMF and the World Bank 
6,436,From an investment perspective the WTO s framework of global trade rules provides the major  institutional and regulatory base without which today s global multinational corporations would be  hard to conceive  Modern financial markets would look different without the large multinational  companies whose stocks and bonds have become key elements in investment portfolios  In the equity  universe for instance investment considerations focusing on global sectors rather than national  markets would make little sense without a critical mass of multinational firms competing with each  other in a globally defined business environment

6,439,SUMMARY
7,439,This reading provides a framework for analyzing a country s trade and capital flows and their  economic implications  It examines basic models that explain trade based on comparative advantage  and provides a basis for understanding how international trade can affect the rate and composition of  economic growth as well as the attractiveness of investment in various sectors 
8,439,  The benefits of trade include
9,439,  gains from exchange and specialization 
10,439,  gains from economies of scale as companies add new markets for their products 
11,439,  greater variety of products available to households and firms  and
12,439,  increased competition and more efficient allocation of resources 
13,439,  A country has an absolute advantage in producing a good  or service  if it is able to produce  that good at a lower absolute cost or use fewer resources in its production than its trading  partner  A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if its opportunity cost of  producing that good is less than that of its trading partner 
14,439,  Even if a country does not have an absolute advantage in the production of any good it can  gain from trade by producing and exporting the good s  in which it has a comparative  advantage and importing good s  in which it has a comparative disadvantage 
15,439,  In the Ricardian model of trade comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined  by differences in technology between countries  In the Heckscher Ohlin model of trade  comparative advantage and the pattern of trade are determined by differences in factor  endowments between countries  In reality technology and factor endowments are  complementary not mutually exclusive determinants of trade patterns 
16,439,  Trade barriers prevent the free flow of goods and services among countries  Governments  impose trade barriers for various reasons including  to promote specific developmental  objectives to counteract certain imperfections in the functioning of markets or to respond to  problems facing their economies

2,440,  For purposes of international trade policy and analysis a small country is defined as one that  cannot affect the world price of traded goods  A large country s production and or  consumption decisions do alter the relative prices of trade goods 
3,440,  In a small country trade barriers generate a net welfare loss arising from distortion of  production and consumption decisions and the associated inefficient allocation of resources 
4,440,  Trade barriers can generate a net welfare gain in a large country if the gain from improving its  terms of trade  higher export prices and lower import prices  more than offsets the loss from  the distortion of resource allocations  However the large country can only gain if it imposes an  even larger welfare loss on its trading partner s  
5,440,  An import tariff and an import quota have the same effect on price production and trade  With  a quota however some or all of the revenue that would be raised by the equivalent tariff is  instead captured by foreign producers  or the foreign government  as quota rents  Thus the  welfare loss suffered by the importing country is generally greater with a quota 
6,440,  A voluntary export restraint is imposed by the exporting country  It has the same impact on the  importing country as an import quota from which foreigners capture all of the quota rents 
7,440,  An export subsidy encourages firms to export their product rather than sell it in the domestic  market  The distortion of production consumption and trade decisions generates a welfare  loss  The welfare loss is greater for a large country because increased production and export of  the subsidized product reduces its global price that is worsens the country s terms of trade 
8,440,  Capital restrictions are defined as controls placed on foreigners  ability to own domestic assets  and or domestic residents  ability to own foreign assets  In contrast to trade restrictions which  limit the openness of goods markets capital restrictions limit the openness of financial  markets 
9,440,  A regional trading bloc is a group of countries who have signed an agreement to reduce and  progressively eliminate barriers to trade and movement of factors of production among the  members of the bloc 
10,440,  They may or may not have common trade barriers against those countries that are not  members of the bloc  In a free trade area all barriers to the flow of goods and services  among members are eliminated but each country maintains its own polices against non  members 
11,440,  A customs union extends the FTA by not only allowing free movement of goods and  services among members but also creating a common trade policy against non members 
12,440,  A common market incorporates all aspects of a customs union and extends it by  allowing free movement of factors of production among members 
13,440,  An economic union incorporates all aspects of a common market and requires common  economic institutions and coordination of economic policies among members 
14,440,  Members of a monetary union adopt a common currency 
15,440,  From an investment perspective it is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature  of trading relationships because they can help identify potential profitable investment  opportunities as well as provide some advance warning signals regarding when to disinvest in  a market or industry

3,441,  capital account balance which mainly consists of capital transfers and net sales of non  produced non financial assets 
4,441,  financial account which measures net capital flows based on sales and purchases of  domestic and foreign financial assets 
5,441,  Decisions by consumers firms and governments influence the balance of payments 
6,441,  Low private savings and or high investment tend to produce a current account deficit  that must be financed by net capital imports  high private savings and or low investment  however produce a current account surplus balanced by net capital exports 
7,441,  All else the same a government deficit produces a current account deficit and a  government surplus leads to a current account surplus 
8,441,  All else the same a sustained current account deficit contributes to a rise in the risk  premium for financial assets of the deficit country  Current account surplus countries  tend to enjoy lower risk premiums than current account deficit countries

2,447,SOLUTIONS
3,447,   A is correct  Countries gain from exchange when trade enables each country to receive a  higher price for exported goods and or pay a lower price for imported goods  This leads to  more efficient resource allocation and allows consumption of a larger variety of goods 
4,447,   B is correct  Resources may need to be reallocated into or out of an industry depending on  whether that industry is an exporting sector or an import competing sector of that economy  As  a result of this adjustment process less efficient companies may be forced to exit the industry  which in turn may lead to higher unemployment and the need for retraining in order for  displaced workers to find jobs in expanding industries 
5,447,   A is correct  The copper industry in Copperland would benefit from trade  Because the cost of  producing copper relative to producing tea is lower in Copperland than in Tealand Copperland  will export copper and the industry will expand 
6,447,   B is correct  Comparative advantage is present when the opportunity cost of producing a good  is less than that of a trading partner 
7,447,   C is correct  While Brazil has an absolute advantage in the production of both flashlights and  vegetables Mexico has a comparative advantage in the production of vegetables  The  opportunity cost of vegetables in Mexico is   per flashlight while the opportunity cost of  vegetables in Brazil is   per flashlight 
8,447,   C is correct  Mexico has the lowest opportunity cost to produce an extra ruler  The opportunity  cost is   pencils per ruler in Mexico   pencils per ruler in Brazil and   pencils per ruler in  China 
9,447,   C is correct  A country gains if trade increases the price of its exports relative to its imports as  compared to its autarkic prices i e  the final terms of trade are more favorable than its autarkic  prices  If the relative price of exports and imports remains the same after trade opens then the  country will consume the same basket of goods before and after trade opens and it gains  nothing from the ability to trade  In that case its trade partner will capture all of the gains  Of  course the opposite is true if the roles are reversed  More generally a country captures more of  the gains from trade the more the final terms of trade differ from its autarkic prices 
10,447,   A is correct  In the Heckscher Ohlin model a country has a comparative advantage in goods  whose production is intensive in the factor with which it is relatively abundantly endowed  In  this case capital is relatively abundant in Germany so Germany has a comparative advantage  in producing the capital intensive product  machine tools  Portugal is relatively labor abundant  hence should produce and export the labor intensive product  wine 
11,447,   B is correct  As a country opens up to trade it has a favorable impact on the abundant factor  and a negative impact on the scarce factor  This is because trade causes the output mix to  change and therefore changes the relative demand for the factors of production  Increased  output of the export product increases demand for the factor that is used intensively in its  production while reduced output of the import product decreases demand for the factor used  intensively in its production  Because the export  import  product uses the abundant  scarce   factor intensively the abundant factor gains relative to the scarce factor in each country 
12,447,    A is correct  The imposition of a tariff will most likely increase domestic government revenue   A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the importing country s government

2,448,    C is correct  With a voluntary export restraint the price increase induced by restricting the  quantity of imports    quota rent for equivalent quota   tariff revenue for equivalent tariff   accrues to foreign exporters and or the foreign government 
3,448,    A is correct  By definition a large country is big enough to affect the world price of its imports  and exports  A large country can benefit by imposing a tariff if its terms of trade improve by  enough to outweigh the welfare loss arising from inefficient allocation of resources 
4,448,    A is correct  A customs union extends a free trade area  FTA  by not only allowing free  movement of goods and services among members but also creating common trade policy  against non members  Unlike a more integrated common market a customs union does not  allow free movement of factors of production among members 
5,448,    C is correct  Regional trading agreements are politically less contentious and quicker to  establish than multilateral trade negotiations  for example under the World Trade  Organization   Policy coordination and harmonization is easier among a smaller group of  countries 
6,448,    A is correct  The capital account measures capital transfers and sale and purchase of non  produced non financial assets such as mineral rights and intangible assets 
7,448,    B is correct  The current account measures the flows of goods and services  including income  from foreign investments   Patent fees and legal services are both captured in the services sub  account of the current account 
8,448,    C is correct  The current account includes income received on foreign investments  The Korean  company effectively  exported  the use of its capital during the quarter to its US subsidiary  and the dividend represents payment for those services 
9,448,    B is correct  A current account deficit tends to result from low private saving high private  investment a government deficit or a combination of the three  Of the choices only low  private savings contributes toward a current account deficit 
10,448,    B is correct  A current account deficit tends to result from low private saving high private  investment low government savings or a combination of the three  Of these choices only high  investments can increase productive resources and improve future ability to repay creditors 
11,448,    B is correct  The WTO provides the legal and institutional foundation of the multinational  trading system and is the only international organization that regulates cross border trade  relations among nations on a global scale  The WTO s mission is to foster free trade by  providing a major institutional and regulatory framework of global trade rules  Without such  global trading rules today s global transnational corporations would be hard to conceive 
12,448,    A is correct  The World Bank s mission is to help developing countries fight poverty and  enhance environmentally sound economic growth  The World Bank helps to create the basic  economic infrastructure essential for creation and maintenance of domestic financial markets  and a well functioning financial industry in developing countries 
13,448,    C is correct  From an investment perspective the IMF helps to keep country specific market  risk and global systemic risk under control  The Greek sovereign debt crisis on      which  threatened to destabilize the entire European banking system is a recent example  The IMF s  mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system the system of exchange  rates and international payments which enables countries to buy goods and services from each  other

2,449,    C is correct  The GATT was the only multilateral body governing international trade from       to       It operated for almost half a century as a quasi institutionalized provisional  system of multilateral treaties and included several rounds of negotiations 
3,449,NOTES
4,449, Comparative advantage refers to a country s ability to produce a good at a relatively lower cost than other goods it  produces as compared with another country  It will be more precisely defined and illustrated in Section     
5,449, Although the prices of imports and exports are each stated in currency units the currency units cancel out when we take  the ratio so the terms of trade reflect the relative price of imports and exports in real  i e  quantity  terms  units of  imports per unit of exports  To see this note that if one unit of imports costs PM currency units and one unit of exports is  priced at PX currency units then the country can buy PX PM    Terms of trade  units of imports for each unit of exports

2,452,   INTRODUCTION
3,452,Measured by daily turnover the foreign exchange  FX  market the market in which currencies  are traded against each other is by far the world s largest market  Current estimates put daily  turnover at approximately USD  trillion for       This is about    to    times larger than daily  turnover in global fixed income markets and about    times larger than global turnover in  equities  Moreover volumes in FX turnover continue to grow  Some predict that daily FX  turnover will reach USD   trillion by      as market participation spreads and deepens 
4,452,The FX market is also a truly global market that operates    hours a day each business day  It  involves market participants from every time zone connected through electronic  communications networks that link players as large as multibillion dollar investment funds and  as small as individuals trading for their own account all brought together in real time   International trade would be impossible without the trade in currencies that facilitates it and so  too would cross border capital flows that connect all financial markets globally through the FX  market 
5,452,These factors make foreign exchange a key market for investors and market participants to  understand  The world economy is increasingly transnational in nature with both production  processes and trade flows often determined more by global factors than by domestic  considerations  Likewise investment portfolio performance increasingly reflects global  determinants because pricing in financial markets responds to the array of investment  opportunities available worldwide not just locally  All of these factors funnel through and are  reflected in the foreign exchange market  As investors shed their  home bias  and invest in  foreign markets the exchange rate the price at which foreign currency denominated  investments are valued in terms of the domestic currency becomes an increasingly important  determinant of portfolio performance 
6,452,Even investors adhering to a purely  domestic  portfolio mandate are increasingly affected by  what happens in the foreign exchange market  Given the globalization of the world economy  most large companies depend heavily on their foreign operations  for example by some  estimates about    percent of S P     Index earnings are from outside the United States    Almost all companies are exposed to some degree of foreign competition and the pricing for  domestic assets equities bonds real estate and others will also depend on demand from  foreign investors  All of these various influences on investment performance reflect  developments in the foreign exchange market 
7,452,This reading introduces the foreign exchange market providing the basic concepts and  terminology necessary to understand exchange rates as well as some of the basics of exchange  rate economics

2,453,The reading is divided up as follows  Section   describes the organization of the foreign  exchange market and discusses the major players who they are how they conduct their  business and how they respond to exchange rate changes  Section   takes up the mechanics of  exchange rates  definitions quotes and calculations  This section shows that the reader has to  pay close attention to conventions used in various foreign exchange markets around the world  because they can vary widely  Sometimes exchange rates are quoted in the number of domestic  currency units per unit of foreign currency and sometimes they are quoted in the opposite way   The exact notation used to represent exchange rates can vary widely as well and occasionally  the same exchange rate notation will be used by different sources to mean completely different  things  The notation used here may not be the same as that encountered elsewhere  Therefore  the focus should be on understanding the underlying concepts rather than relying on rote  memorization of formulas  We also show how to calculate cross exchange rates and how to  compute the forward exchange rate given either the forward points or the percentage forward  premium or discount  In Section   we discuss alternative exchange rate regimes operating  throughout the world  Finally in Section   we discuss how exchange rates affect a country s  international trade  exports and imports  and capital flows  A summary and practice problems  conclude the reading 
3,453,   THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET
4,453,To understand the FX market it is necessary to become familiar with some of its basic  conventions  Individual currencies are often referred to by standardized three letter codes that  the market has agreed upon through the International Organization for Standardization  ISO    Exhibit   lists some of the major global currencies and their identification codes

3,454,It is important to understand that there is a difference between referring to an individual  currency and an exchange rate  One can hold an individual currency  for example in a EUR     million deposit  but an exchange rate refers to the price of one currency in terms of another  for  example the exchange rate between the EUR and USD   An individual currency can be  singular but there are always two currencies involved in an exchange rate  the price of one  currency relative to another  The exchange rate is the number of units of one currency  called  the price currency  that one unit of another currency  called the base currency  will buy  An  equivalent way of describing the exchange rate is as the cost of one unit of the base currency in  terms of the price currency 
4,454,This distinction between individual currencies and exchange rates is important because as we  will see in a later section these three letter currency codes can be used both ways   For  example when used as an exchange rate in the professional FX market EUR is understood to  be the exchange rate between the euro and US dollar   But be aware of the context  either as a  currency or as an exchange rate  in which these three letter currency codes are being used  To  avoid confusion this reading will identify exchange rates using the convention of  A B   referring to the number of units of currency A that one unit of currency B will buy  For  example a USD EUR exchange rate of        means that   euro will buy        US dollars   i e    euro costs        US dollars    In this case the euro is the base currency and the US  dollar is the price currency  A decrease in this exchange rate would mean that the euro costs less  or that fewer US dollars are needed to buy one euro  In other words a decline in this exchange  rate indicates that the USD is appreciating against the EUR or equivalently the EUR is  depreciating against the USD 
5,454,The exchange rates described above are referred to as nominal exchange rates  This is to  distinguish them from real exchange rates which are indexes often constructed by economists  and other market analysts to assess changes in the relative purchasing power of one currency  compared with another  Creating these indexes requires adjusting the nominal exchange rate by  using the price levels in each country of the currency pair  hence the name  real exchange  rates   in order to compare the relative purchasing power between countries 
6,454,In a world of homogenous goods and services and with no market frictions or trade barriers the  relative purchasing power across countries would tend to equalize  Why would you pay more  in real terms domestically for a  widget  if you could import an identical  widget  from  overseas at a cheaper price  This basic concept is the intuition behind a theory known as   purchasing power parity   PPP  which describes the long term equilibrium of nominal  exchange rates  PPP asserts that nominal exchange rates adjust so that identical goods  or  baskets of goods  will have the same price in different markets  Or put differently the  purchasing power of different currencies is equalized for a standardized basket of goods

2,455,In practice the conditions required to enforce PPP are not satisfied  Goods and services are not  identical across countries  countries typically have different baskets of goods and services  produced and consumed  many goods and services are not traded internationally  there are trade  barriers and transaction costs  e g  shipping costs and import taxes   and capital flows are at  least as important as trade flows in determining nominal exchange rates  As a result nominal  exchange rates exhibit persistent deviations from PPP  Moreover relative purchasing power  among countries displays a weak if any tendency toward long term equalization  A simple  example of a cross country comparison of the purchasing power of a standardized good is the   Big Mac  index produced by the Economist which shows the relative price of this  standardized hamburger in different countries  The Big Mac index shows that fast food  hamburger prices can vary widely internationally and that this difference in purchasing power is  typical of most goods and services  Hence movements in real exchange rates provide  meaningful information about changes in relative purchasing power among countries 
3,455,Consider the case of an individual who wants to purchase goods from a foreign country  The  individual would be able to buy fewer of these goods if the nominal spot exchange rate for the  foreign currency appreciated or if the foreign price level increased  Conversely the individual  could buy more foreign goods if the individual s domestic income increased   For this example  we will assume that changes in the individual s income are proportional to changes in the  domestic price level   Hence in real purchasing power terms the real exchange rate that an  individual faces is an increasing function of the nominal exchange rate  quoted in terms of the  number of units of domestic currency per one unit of foreign currency  and the foreign price  level and a decreasing function of the domestic price level  The higher the real exchange rate  that this individual faces the fewer foreign goods in real terms the individual can purchase and  the lower that individual s relative purchasing power compared with the other country 
4,455,An equivalent way of viewing the real exchange rate is that it represents the relative price levels  in the domestic and foreign countries  Mathematically we can represent the foreign price level  in terms of the domestic currency as 
5,455,Foreign price level in domestic currency   Sd f   Pf
6,455,where Sd f is the spot exchange rate  quoted in terms of the number of units of domestic  currency per one unit of foreign currency  and Pf is foreign price level quoted in terms of the  foreign currency  We can define the domestic price level in terms of the domestic currency as  Pd  Hence the ratio between the foreign and domestic price levels is 
7,455,Real exchange rate d f     Sd f   Pf  Pd   Sd f    Pf Pd 
8,455,For example for a British consumer wanting to buy goods made in the Eurozone the real  exchange rate  defined in GBP EUR terms  note that the domestic currency for the United  Kingdom is the price currency not the base currency  will be an increasing function of the  nominal spot exchange rate  GBP EUR  and the Eurozone price level and a decreasing function  of the UK price level  This is written as

15,455, 
16,455,Let s examine the effect of movements in the domestic and foreign price levels and the  nominal spot exchange rate on the real purchasing power of an individual in the United  Kingdom wanting to purchase Eurozone goods  Assume that the nominal spot exchange rate   GBP EUR  increases by    percent the Eurozone price level by   percent and the UK price  level by   percent  The change in the real exchange rate is then

12,456,                         
13,456,In this case the real exchange rate for the UK based individual has increased about    percent  meaning that it now costs more in real terms to buy Eurozone goods  Or put differently the  UK individual s real purchasing power relative to Eurozone goods has declined by about     percent  An easy way to remember this relationship is to consider the real exchange rate  stated  with the domestic currency as the price currency  as representing the real price you face in order  to purchase foreign goods and services  The higher the price  real exchange rate  the lower your relative purchasing power 
14,456,The real exchange rate for a currency can be constructed for the domestic currency relative to a  single foreign currency or relative to a basket of foreign currencies  In either case these real  exchange rate indexes depend on the assumptions made by the analyst creating them  Several  investment banks and central banks create proprietary measures of real exchange rates  It is  important to note that real exchange rates are not quoted or traded in global FX markets  They  are only indexes created by analysts to understand the international competitiveness of an  economy and the real purchasing power of a currency 
15,456,In this context real exchange rates can be useful for understanding trends in international trade  and capital flows and hence can be seen as one of the influences on nominal spot exchange  rates  As an example consider the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar   During      the nominal yuan exchange rate against the US dollar  CNY USD  declined by  approximately   percent meaning that the US dollar depreciated against the yuan  However  the annual inflation rates in the United States and China were different during       approximately     percent for the United States and     percent for China  This means  that the real exchange rate  in CNY USD terms  was depreciating more rapidly than the  nominal CNY USD exchange rate

21,456,                             
22,456,This combination of a stronger yuan and a higher Chinese inflation rate meant that the real  exchange rate faced by China was declining thus increasing Chinese purchasing power in USD  terms 
23,456,Movements in real exchange rates can have a similar effect as movements in nominal exchange  rates in terms of affecting relative prices and hence trade flows  Even if the nominal spot  exchange rate does not move differences in inflation rates between countries affect their  relative competitiveness 
24,456,Although real exchange rates can exert some influence on nominal exchange rate movements  they are only one of many factors  it can be difficult to disentangle all of these inter  relationships in a complex and dynamic FX market  As discussed earlier PPP is a poor guide to  predicting future movements in nominal exchange rates because these rates can deviate from  PPP equilibrium and even continue to trend away from their PPP level for years at a time   Hence it should not be surprising that real exchange rates which reflect changes in relative  purchasing power have a poor track record as a predictor of future nominal exchange rate  movements

2,457,EXAMPLE  
3,457,Nominal and Real Exchange Rates
4,457,An investment adviser located in Sydney Australia is meeting with a local client who is  looking to diversify her domestic bond portfolio by adding investments in fixed rate  long term bonds denominated in HKD  The client frequently visits Hong Kong and  many of her annual expenses are denominated in HKD  The client however is  concerned about the foreign currency risks of offshore investments and whether the  investment return on her HKD denominated investments will maintain her purchasing  power both domestically  i e  for her AUD denominated expenses  and in terms of her  foreign trips  i e  denominated in HKD for her visits to Hong Kong   The investment  adviser explains the effect of changes in nominal and real exchange rates to the client  and illustrates this explanation by making the following statements 
5,457,Statement  
6,457,All else equal an increase in the nominal AUD HKD exchange rate  will lead to an increase in the AUD denominated value of your  foreign investment 
7,457,Statement  
8,457,All else equal an increase in the nominal AUD HKD exchange rate  means that your relative purchasing power for your Hong Kong  trips will increase  based on paying for your trip with the income  from your HKD denominated bonds  
9,457,Statement  
10,457,All else equal an increase in the Australian inflation rate will lead  to an increase in the real exchange rate  AUD HKD   A higher real  exchange rate means that the relative purchasing power of your  AUD denominated income is higher 
11,457,Statement  
12,457,All else equal a decrease in the nominal exchange rate   AUD HKD  will decrease the real exchange rate  AUD HKD  and  increase the relative purchasing power of your AUD denominated  income 
13,457,To demonstrate the effects of the changes in inflation and nominal exchange rates on  relative purchasing power the adviser uses the following scenario   Suppose that the  AUD HKD exchange rate increases by   percent the price of goods and services in  Hong Kong goes up by   percent and the price of Australian goods and services goes up  by   percent  
14,457,   Statement   is 
15,457,A  correct 
16,457,B  incorrect because based on the quote convention the investment s value  would be decreasing in AUD terms 
17,457,C  incorrect because the nominal AUD value of the foreign investments will  depend on movements in the Australian inflation rate

2,458,   Statement   is 
3,458,A  correct 
4,458,B  incorrect because purchasing power is not affected in this case 
5,458,C  incorrect because based on the quote convention the client s relative  purchasing power would be decreasing 
6,458,   Statement   is 
7,458,A  correct 
8,458,B  incorrect with respect to the real exchange rate only 
9,458,C  incorrect with respect to both the real exchange rate and the purchasing  power of AUD denominated income 
10,458,   Statement   is 
11,458,A  correct 
12,458,B  incorrect with respect to the real exchange rate 
13,458,C  incorrect with respect to the purchasing power of AUD denominated  income 
14,458,   Based on the adviser s scenario and assuming that the HKD value of the HKD  bonds remained unchanged the nominal AUD value of the client s HKD  investments would 
15,458,A  decrease by about   percent 
16,458,B  increase by about   percent 
17,458,C  remain approximately the same 
18,458,   Based on the adviser s scenario the change in the relative purchasing power of  the client s AUD denominated income is closest to 
19,458,A     percent 
20,458,B     percent 
21,458,C      percent 
22,458,Solution to   
23,458,A is correct  Given the quoting convention an increase in the AUD HKD rate means  that the base currency  HKD  is appreciating  one HKD will buy more AUD   This is  increasing the nominal value of the HKD denominated investments when measured in  AUD terms

2,459,B is correct  When paying for HKD denominated expenses with HKD denominated  income the value of the AUD HKD spot exchange rate  or any other spot exchange  rate  would not be relevant  In fact this is a basic principle of currency risk  management  reducing FX risk exposures by denominating assets and liabilities  or  income and expenses  in the same currency 
3,459,Solution to   
4,459,C is correct  An increase in the Australian  i e  domestic  inflation rate means that the  real exchange rate  measured in domestic foreign or AUD HKD terms  would be  decreasing not increasing  Moreover an increase in the real exchange rate  RAUD HKD   would be equivalent to a reduction of the purchasing power of the Australian client   Goods and services denominated in HKD would cost more 
5,459,Solution to   
6,459,A is correct  As the spot AUD HKD exchange rate decreases the HKD is depreciating  against the AUD  or equivalently the AUD is appreciating against the HKD  This is  reducing the real exchange rate  RAUD HKD  and increasing the Australian client s  purchasing power 
7,459,Solution to   
8,459,B is correct  As the AUD HKD spot exchange rate increases by   percent the HKD is  appreciating against the AUD by   percent and all else equal the value of the HKD  denominated investment is increasing by   percent in AUD terms 
9,459,Solution to   
10,459,A is correct  The real exchange rate  RAUD HKD  is expressed as 
11,459,R
12,459,AUD HKD
13,459,  S
14,459,AUD HKD
15,459, 
16,459,PHKD PAUD
17,459,The information in the adviser s scenario can be expressed as 
18,459,  R
19,459,AUD HKD
20,459,    S
21,459,AUD HKD
22,459,    PHKD     PAUD                      
23,459,Because the real exchange rate  expressed in AUD HKD terms  has gone up by about    percent the real purchasing power of the investor based in Australia has declined by  about   percent  This can be seen from the fact that HKD has appreciated against the  AUD in nominal terms and the Hong Kong price level has also increased  This increase  in the cost of Hong Kong goods and services  measured in AUD  is only partially offset  by the small    percent  increase in the investor s income  assumed equal to the change  in the Australian price level

2,460,     Market Functions
3,460,FX markets facilitate international trade in goods and services where companies and  individuals need to make transactions in foreign currencies  This would cover everything from  companies and governments buying and selling products in other countries to tourists engaged  in cross border travel  for example a German tourist selling euros and buying sterling for a visit  to London   Although this is an important dimension of FX markets and despite the growth of  global trade in recent years an even larger proportion of the daily turnover in FX markets is  accounted for by capital market transactions where investors convert between currencies for the  purpose of moving funds into  or out of  foreign assets  These types of transactions cover the  range from direct investments  for example companies buying such fixed assets as factories  in  other countries to portfolio investments  the purchase of stocks bonds and other financial  assets denominated in foreign currencies   Because capital is extremely mobile in modern  financial markets this ebb and flow of money across international borders and currencies  generates a huge and growing volume of FX transactions 
4,460,Regardless of the underlying motivation for the FX transaction it will eventually require that  one currency be exchanged for another in the FX market  In advance of that required  transaction market participants are exposed to the risk that the exchange rate will move against  them  Often they will try to reduce  hedge  this risk through a variety of FX instruments   described in more detail later   Conversely market participants may form opinions about future  FX movements and undertake speculative FX risk exposures through a variety of FX  instruments in order to profit from their views 
5,460,The distinction between hedging and speculative positions is not always clear cut  For example  consider the case of a corporation selling its products overseas  This creates an FX risk  exposure because the revenue from foreign sales will ultimately need to be converted into the  corporation s home currency  This risk exposure is typically hedged and corporate hedging  often accounts for large FX flows passing through the market  The amount and timing of  foreign revenue however are generally hard to predict with precision  They will depend on the  pace of foreign sales the sales prices realized the pace at which foreign clients pay for their  purchases and so forth  In the face of this uncertainty the corporate treasury will estimate the  timing and amount of foreign revenue and will then hedge a portion of this estimated amount   Many corporate treasuries have hedging targets based on this estimate but they also have the  flexibility to under hedge or over hedge based on their opinions about future FX rate  movements  In order to judge the effectiveness of these discretionary trades the performance of  the corporate treasury is compared with a benchmark usually stated in terms of a fixed amount  hedged relative to total sales   For example the benchmark may be a     percent fully hedged  position  The profitability of the hedge actually implemented which based on the treasury s  discretion can vary above or below     percent is then compared with what would have been  achieved with a passive     percent fully hedged position   Treasury managers  performance is  judged based on gains or losses relative to the benchmark just as an investment fund manager s  performance is benchmarked against performance targets 
6,460,At the other end of the spectrum between hedging and speculation consider the archetypical  speculative account  a hedge fund  Although it is true that hedge funds will seek out accept  and manage risk for profit a hedge fund is after all a hedge fund  Strict risk control procedures  are critical to the fund s success especially when leverage is involved  This mixture of  speculative and hedging motives is common throughout the FX space as market participants  shape their FX exposures to suit their market forecasts operational mandates and appetites for  risk

2,461,The FX market provides a variety of products that provide the flexibility to meet this varied and  complex set of financial goals  Spot transactions involve the exchange of currencies for  immediate delivery  For most currencies this corresponds to  T      delivery meaning that the  exchange of currencies is settled two business days after the trade is agreed to by the two sides  of the deal   One exception is the Canadian dollar for which spot settlement against the US  dollar is on a T     basis   The exchange rate used for these spot transactions is referred to as  the spot exchange rate and it is the exchange rate that most people refer to in their daily lives   for example this is the exchange rate usually quoted by the financial press on the evening  news and so forth  
3,461,It is important to realize however that spot transactions make up only a minority of total daily  turnover in the global FX market  The rest is accounted for by trade in outright forward  contracts FX swaps and FX options  Although these products will be covered in more depth in  a subsequent section and at Level II of the CFA curriculum we will provide a brief  introduction to these products here 
4,461,Outright forward contracts  often referred to simply as forwards  are agreements to deliver  foreign exchange at a future date at an exchange rate agreed upon today  For example suppose  that a UK based company expects to receive a payment of     million euros in    days   Although it could convert these euros to British pounds with a spot transaction  the spot rate  would be the GBP EUR rate in    days because of T     settlement  this future spot rate is  currently unknown and represents a foreign exchange risk to the company  The company can  avoid this risk by entering into a transaction with a foreign exchange dealer to sell     million  euros against the British pound for settlement    days from today at a rate the forward  exchange rate agreed upon today 
5,461,As such forward contracts are any exchange rate transactions that occur with currency  settlement longer than the usual T     settlement for spot delivery  Each of these contracts  requires two specifications  the date at which the currencies are to be exchanged and the  exchange rate to be applied on the settlement date  Accordingly exchange rates for these  transactions are called forward exchange rates to distinguish them from spot rates 
6,461,Dealers will typically quote forward rates for a variety of standard forward settlement dates  for  example one week one month or    days  on their dealing screens  In an over the counter   OTC  market however traders can arrange forward settlement at any future date they agree  upon with the forward exchange rate scaled appropriately for the specific term to settlement   Standard forward settlement dates  such as three months  are defined in terms of the spot  settlement date which is generally T      For example if today is    October and spot  settlement is for    October then a three month forward settlement would be defined as     January of the following year  Note as well that these standard forward settlement dates may not  always be good business days     January could be a weekend or a holiday  In that case the  forward settlement date is set to the closest good business day  Traders always confirm the  exact forward settlement date when making these types of trades and the forward rate is scaled  by the exact number of days to settlement 
7,461,In an OTC market the size of the forward contracts can also be any size that the two  counterparties agree upon  In general however liquidity in forward markets declines the longer  the term to maturity and the larger the trade size  The concept of the forward exchange rate and  exchange hedging is developed further in Section

2,462,Although the OTC market accounts for the majority of foreign exchange trades with future  i e   greater than T      settlement dates there is also a deep liquid market in exchange traded  futures contracts for currencies  Although there are technical differences between futures and  forward contracts the basic concept is the same  The price is set today for settlement on a  specified future date  Futures contracts on currencies trade on several exchanges globally but  the majority of volume in exchange traded currency futures contracts is found on the  International Monetary Market  IMM  division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME    Futures contracts differ from OTC forward contracts in several important ways  They trade on  exchanges  such as the CME  rather than OTC  they are only available for fixed contract  amounts and fixed settlement dates  the exchanges demand that a fixed amount of collateral be  posted against the futures contract trade  and this collateral is marked to market daily with  counterparties asked to post further collateral if their positions generate losses  On balance  futures contracts are somewhat less flexible than forward contracts  Nonetheless they provide  deep liquid markets for deferred delivery with a minimum of counterparty  i e  default  risk a  proposition that many FX traders find attractive  Accordingly daily turnover in FX futures  contracts is huge  As of      the average daily trading volume of FX futures on the CME alone  was estimated to be about USD    billion which is almost comparable in size to the interbank  volume of spot transactions 
3,462,Because forward contracts eventually expire existing speculative positions or FX hedges that  need to be extended must be rolled prior to their settlement dates  This typically involves a spot  transaction to offset  settle  the expiring forward contract and a new forward contract to be set  at a new more distant settlement date  The combination of an offsetting spot transaction and a  new forward contract is referred to as an FX swap  
4,462,An FX swap is best illustrated by an example  Suppose that a trader sells     million euros with  settlement    days from today at a forward exchange rate  USD EUR  of         In    days  the forward contract is two days from settlement specifically the T     days to spot settlement   To roll the forward contract the trader will engage in the following FX swap  First the trader  will need to buy     million euros spot for which T     settlement will fall on day    the same  day as the settlement of the expiring forward contract  The purchase of the     million euros  spot will be used to satisfy the delivery of the     million euros sold in the expiring forward  contract  Because     million euros are being both bought and sold on day    there is no  exchange of euros between counterparties on that day  The amounts net to zero  However there  will be an exchange of US dollars reflecting the movement in exchange rates between the date  the forward contract was agreed to  day    and day     Suppose that on day    the spot  exchange rate for USD EUR is         This means that the trader will see a cash flow on day     of USD         This is calculated as follows 
5,462,EUR                                USD       
6,462,The trader receives USD        from the counterparty because the euro was sold forward to  day    at a price of         it was bought  on day     for spot settlement on day    at a price of          This price movement in the euro indicates a profit to the trader but because the euro  quantities exchanged on day    net to zero            euros both bought and sold  this cash  flow is realized in US dollars  The second leg of the FX swap is then to initiate a new forward  sale of     million euros at the USD EUR forward exchange rate being quoted on day     This  renews the forward position  a forward sale of the euro  to a new date

2,463,FX swaps will be dealt with in more detail at Level II in the curriculum  For the purposes of this  reading it is only necessary to understand that     an FX swap consists of a simultaneous spot  and forward transaction      these swap transactions can extend  roll  an existing forward  position to a new future date  and     rolling the position forward leads to a cash flow on  settlement day  This cash flow can be thought of as a mark to market on the forward position   FX swaps are a large component of daily FX market turnover because market participants have  to roll over existing speculative or hedging positions as the underlying forward contracts mature  in order to extend the hedge or speculative position  otherwise the position is closed out on the  forward settlement date  
3,463,One other area where FX swaps are used in FX markets also bears mentioning  They are often  used by market participants as a funding source  called swap funding   Consider the case of a  UK based firm that needs to borrow GBP    million for    days starting   days from today   One way to do this is simply to borrow    day money in GBP denominated funds starting at T       An alternative is to borrow in US dollars and exchange these for British pounds in the spot  FX market  both with T     settlement  and then sell British pounds    days forward against the  US dollar   Recall that the maturity of a forward rate contract is defined in terms of the spot  settlement date so the    day forward rate would be for settlement in    days from today   The  company has the use of GBP    million for    days starting on T     and at the end of this  period can pay off the US dollar loan at a known pre determined exchange rate  the    day  forward rate   By engaging in simultaneous spot and forward transactions  i e  an FX swap   the company has eliminated any FX risk from the foreign borrowing  The all in financing rate  using an FX swap will typically be close to that of domestic borrowing usually within a few  basis points  This near equivalence is enforced by an arbitrage relationship that will be  described in Section      On large borrowing amounts however even a small differential can  add up to substantial cost savings 
4,463,Another way to hedge FX exposures or implement speculative FX positions is to use options  on currencies  FX options are contracts that for an upfront premium or fee give the purchaser  the right but not the obligation to make an FX transaction at some future date at an exchange  rate agreed upon today  when the contract is agreed to   The holder of an FX option will  exercise the option only if it is advantageous to do so that is if the agreed upon exchange rate  for the FX option contract is better than the FX rate available in the market at option expiry  As  such options are extremely flexible tools for managing FX exposures and account for a large  percentage of daily turnover in the FX market 
5,463,Another concept to bear in mind is that spot forward swap and option products are typically  not used in isolation  Most major market participants manage their FX transactions and FX risk  exposures through concurrent spot forward swap and option positions  Taken together these  instruments  the building blocks of the FX market  provide an extremely flexible way for  market participants to shape their FX risk exposures to match their operational mandate risk  tolerance and market opinion  Moreover FX transactions are often made in conjunction with  transactions in other financial markets such as equities fixed income and commodities  These  markets have a variety of instruments as well and market participants jointly tailor their overall position simultaneously using the building blocks of the FX market and these other markets

2,464,Spot and Forward Exchange Rates
3,464,The investment adviser based in Sydney Australia continues her meeting with the local  client who has diversified her domestic bond portfolio by adding investments in fixed  rate long term bonds denominated in HKD  Given that the client spends most of the  year in Australia she remains concerned about the foreign exchange risk of her foreign  investments and asks the adviser how these might be managed  The investment adviser  explains the difference between spot and forward exchange rates and their role in  determining foreign exchange risk exposures  The investment adviser suggests the  following investment strategy to the client   You can exchange AUD for HKD in the  spot exchange market invest in a risk free one year HKD denominated zero coupon  bond and use a one year forward contract for converting the proceeds back into AUD  
4,464,Spot exchange rate  AUD HKD          One year HKD interest rate       One year forward exchange rate  AUD HKD        
5,464,   Which of the following statements is most correct  Over a one year horizon the  exchange rate risk of the client s investment in HKD denominated bonds is  determined by uncertainty over 
6,464,A  today s AUD HKD forward rate 
7,464,B  the AUD HKD spot rate one year from now 
8,464,C  the AUD HKD forward rate one year from now 
9,464,   To reduce the exchange rate risk of the Hong Kong investment the client should 
10,464,A  sell AUD spot 
11,464,B  sell AUD forward 
12,464,C  sell HKD forward 
13,464,   Over a one year horizon the investment proposed by the investment adviser is  most likely 
14,464,A  risk free 
15,464,B  exposed to interest rate risk 
16,464,C  exposed to exchange rate risk 
17,464,   To set up the investment proposed by the adviser the client would need to 
18,464,A  sell AUD spot  sell a one year HKD denominated bond  and buy AUD  forward

2,465,C  sell AUD spot  buy a one year HKD denominated bond  and buy AUD  forward 
3,465,   The return  in AUD  on the investment proposed by the investment adviser is  closest to 
4,465,A       percent 
5,465,B       percent 
6,465,C       percent 
7,465,Solution to   
8,465,B is correct  The exchange rate risk  for an unhedged investment  is defined by the  uncertainty over future spot rates  In this case the relevant spot rate is that which would  prevail one year from now  Forward rates that would be in effect one year from now  would be irrelevant and the current forward rate is known with certainty 
9,465,Solution to   
10,465,C is correct  The Australian based investor owns HKD denominated bonds meaning  that she is long HKD exposure  To hedge this exposure she could enter into a forward  contract to sell the HKD against the AUD for future delivery  that is match a long HKD  exposure in the cash market with a short HKD exposure in the derivatives market   The  forward rate is established at the time the forward contract is entered into eliminating  any uncertainty about what exchange rate would be used to convert HKD denominated  cash flows back into AUD 
11,465,Solution to   
12,465,A is correct  The investment is risk free because the investment is based on a risk free  one year zero coupon HKD denominated bond meaning there is no default or  reinvestment risk  The investment will mature in one year at par  there is no interest rate  risk  The use of a forward contract to convert the HKD denominated proceeds back to  AUD eliminates any exchange rate risk 
13,465,Solution to   
14,465,C is correct  To create the investment the client needs to convert AUD to HKD in the  spot exchange market invest in  buy  the one year HKD bond and sell the HKD  forward buy the AUD forward  Note that this process is directly comparable to the swap  financing approach described in this section of the reading 
15,465,Solution to   
16,465,A is correct  Converting one AUD to HKD in the spot market gives the client               HKD      Investing this for one year leads to                 HKD      Selling this  amount of HKD at the forward rate gives                 AUD      rounding to two  decimal places   This implies an AUD denominated return of   percent

2,466,     Market Participants
3,466,We now turn to the counterparties that participate in FX markets  As mentioned previously  there is an extremely diverse range of market participants ranging in size from multi billion  dollar investment funds down to individuals trading for their own account  including foreign  tourists exchanging currencies at airport kiosks  
4,466,To understand the various market participants it is useful to separate them into broad  categories  One broad distinction is between what the market refers to as the buy side and the  sell side  The sell side generally consists of large FX trading banks  such as Citigroup UBS  and Deutsche Bank   the buy side consists of clients who use these banks to undertake FX  transactions  i e  buy FX products  from the sell side banks 
5,466,The buy side can be further broken down into several categories 
6,466,  Corporate accounts  Corporations of all sizes undertake FX transactions during cross  border purchases and sales of goods and services  Many of their FX flows can also be  related to cross border investment flows such as international mergers and acquisitions   M A  transactions investment of corporate funds in foreign assets and foreign  currency borrowing 
7,466,  Real money accounts  These are investment funds managed by insurance companies  mutual funds pension funds endowments exchange traded funds  ETFs  and other  institutional investors  These accounts are referred to as real money because they are  usually restricted in their use of leverage or financial derivatives  This distinguishes them  from leveraged accounts  discussed next   although many institutional investors often  engage in some form of leverage either directly through some use of borrowed funds or  indirectly using financial derivatives 
8,466,  Leveraged accounts  This category often referred to as the professional trading  community consists of hedge funds proprietary trading shops commodity trading  advisers  CTAs  high frequency algorithmic traders and the proprietary trading desks at  banks and indeed almost any active trading account that accepts and manages FX risk  for profit  The professional trading community accounts for a large and growing  proportion of daily FX market turnover  These active trading accounts also have a wide  diversity of trading styles  Some are macro hedge funds that take longer term FX  positions based on their views of the underlying economic fundamentals of a currency   Others are high frequency algorithmic traders that use technical trading strategies  such  as those based on moving averages or Fibonacci levels  and whose trading cycles and  investment horizons are sometimes measured in milliseconds 
9,466,  Retail accounts  The simplest example of a retail account is the archetypical foreign  tourist exchanging currency at an airport kiosk  However it is important to realize that as  electronic trading technology has reduced the barriers to entry into FX markets and the  costs of FX trading there has been a huge surge in speculative trading activity by retail  accounts consisting of individuals trading for their own accounts as well as smaller  hedge funds and other active traders  This also includes households using electronic  trading technology to move their savings into foreign currencies  this is relatively  widespread among households in Japan for example   It is estimated that retail trading  accounts for as much as    percent of all spot transactions in some currency pairs and that  this proportion is growing

2,467,  Governments  Public entities of all types often have FX needs ranging from relatively  small  e g  maintaining consulates in foreign countries  to large  e g  military equipment  purchases or maintaining overseas military bases   Sometimes these flows are purely  transactional the business simply needs to be done and sometimes government FX  flows reflect at least in part the public policy goals of the government  Some  government FX business resembles that of investment funds although sometimes with a  public policy mandate as well  In some countries public sector pension plans and public  insurance schemes are run by a branch of the government  One example is the Caisse de  d p t et placement du Qu bec which was created by the Qu bec provincial government  in Canada to manage that province s public sector pension plans  The Caisse as it is  called is a relatively large player in financial markets with about CAD    billion of  assets under management as of       Although it has a mandate to invest these assets for  optimal return it is also called upon to help promote the economic development of  Qu bec  It should be noted that many governments both at the federal and  provincial state levels issue debt in foreign currencies  this too creates FX flows  Such  supranational agencies as the World Bank and the African Development Bank issue debt  in a variety of currencies as well 
3,467,  Central banks  These entities sometimes intervene in FX markets in order to influence  either the level or trend in the domestic exchange rate  This often occurs when the central  banks judge their domestic currency to be too weak and when the exchange rate has  overshot any concept of equilibrium level  e g  because of a speculative attack  to the  degree that the exchange rate no longer reflects underlying economic fundamentals   Alternatively central banks also intervene when the FX market has become so erratic and  dysfunctional that end users such as corporations can no longer transact necessary FX  business  Conversely sometimes central banks intervene when they believe that their  domestic currency has become too strong to the point that it undercuts that country s  export competitiveness  The Bank of Japan intervened against yen strength versus the US  dollar in      and again in September       Similarly in      the Swiss National Bank  intervened against strength in the Swiss franc versus the euro by selling the Swiss franc  on the euro Swiss  CHF EUR  cross rate  Central bank reserve managers are also  frequent participants in FX markets in order to manage their country s FX reserves  In  this context they act much like real money investment funds although generally with a  cautious conservative mandate to safeguard the value of their country s foreign exchange  reserves  The foreign exchange reserves of some countries are enormous and central  bank participation in FX markets can sometimes have a material impact on exchange  rates even when these reserve managers are not intervening for public policy purposes   Exhibit   provides information on central bank reserve holdings as of the second quarter  of

2,468,a This percentage is calculated using that amount of global currency reserves for which the currency  composition can be identified 
3,468,Note that the amount of foreign exchange reserves now held by emerging economies  comfortably exceeds those held by developed economies  This largely reflects the rapid growth  in foreign reserves held by Asian central banks because these countries typically run large  current account surpluses with the United States and other developed economies  Reserve  accumulation by energy exporting countries in the Middle East and elsewhere is also a factor   Most of the global currency reserves are held in US dollars  the percentage held in USD is more  than twice the portion held in the euro the second most widely held currency in central bank  foreign exchange reserves 
4,468,  Sovereign wealth funds  SWFs   Many countries with large current account surpluses  have diverted some of the resultant international capital flows into SWFs rather than into  foreign exchange reserves managed by central banks  Although SWFs are government  entities their mandate is usually more oriented to purely investment purposes rather than  public policy purposes  As such SWFs can be thought of as akin to real money accounts  although some SWFs can employ derivatives or engage in aggressive trading strategies  It  is generally understood that SWFs use their resources to help fulfill the public policy  mandate of their government owners  The SWFs of many current account surplus  countries  such as exporting countries in East Asia or oil exporting countries  are  enormous and their FX flows can be an important determinant of exchange rate  movements in almost all of the major currency pairs 
5,468,As mentioned the sell side generally consists of the FX dealing banks that sell FX products to  the buy side  Even here however distinctions can be made 
6,468,  A large and growing proportion of the daily FX turnover is accounted for by the very  largest dealing banks such as Deutsche Bank Citigroup UBS HSBC and a few other  multinational banking behemoths  Maintaining a competitive advantage in FX requires  huge fixed cost investments in the electronic technology that connects the FX market  and it also requires a broad global client base  As a result only the largest banks are able  to compete successfully in providing competitive price quotes to clients across the broad  range of FX products  In fact among the largest FX dealing banks a large proportion of  their business is crossed internally meaning that these banks are able to connect buyers  and sellers within their own extremely diverse client base and have no need to show these  FX flows outside of the bank 
7,468,  All other banks fall into the second and third tier of the FX market sell side  Many of  these financial institutions are regional or local banks with well developed business  relationships but they lack the economies of scale broad global client base or  information technology  IT  expertise required to offer competitive pricing across a wide  range of currencies and FX products  In many cases these are banks in emerging markets  that don t have the business connections or credit lines required to access the FX market  on a cost effective basis on their own  As a result these banks often outsource FX  services by forming business relationships with the larger tier one banks  otherwise they  depend on the deep competitive liquidity provided by the largest FX market participants

2,469,The categories presented are based on functions that are closely associated with the named  groups  However in some cases functions typifying a group may also be assumed by or shared  with another group  For example sell side banks provide FX price quotes  However hedge  funds and other large players may access the professional FX market on equal terms with the  dealing banks and effectively act as market makers 
3,469,One of the most important ideas to draw from this categorization of market participants is that  there is an extremely wide variety of FX market participants reflecting a complex mix of  trading motives and strategies that can vary with time  Most market participants reflect a  combination of hedging and speculative motives in tailoring their FX risk exposures  Among  public sector market participants public policy motives may also be a factor  The dynamic  complex interaction of FX market participants and their trading objectives makes it difficult to  analyze or predict movements in FX rates with any precision or to describe the FX market  adequately with simple characterizations 
4,469,     Market Size and Composition
5,469,In this section we present a descriptive overview of the global FX market drawn from the       Triennial Survey undertaken by the Bank for International Settlements         The BIS is an  umbrella organization for the world s central banks  Every three years participating central  banks undertake a survey of the FX market in their jurisdictions the results of which are  aggregated and compiled at the BIS  The most recent survey taken in April      gives a broad  indication of the current size and distribution of global FX market flows 
6,469,As of April      the BIS estimates that average daily turnover in the traditional FX market   comprised of spot outright forward and FX swap transactions  totaled approximately USD     trillion  Exhibit   shows the approximate percentage allocation among FX product types  including both traditional FX products and exchange traded FX derivatives  Note that this table  of percentage allocations adds exchange traded derivatives to the BIS estimate of average daily  turnover of USD    trillion  the  Spot  and  OTC forwards  categories include only  transactions that are not executed as part of a swap transaction

2,470,The survey also provides a percentage breakdown of the average daily flows between sell side  banks  called the interbank market  between banks and financial customers  all non bank  financial entities such as real money and leveraged accounts SWFs and central banks  and  between banks and non financial customers  such as corporations retail accounts and  governments   The breakdown is provided in Exhibit    It bears noting that the proportion of  average daily FX flow accounted for by financial clients is much larger than that for non  financial clients  The BIS also reports that the proportion of financial client flows has been  growing rapidly and as of      it exceeded interbank trading volume for the first time  This  underscores the fact that only a minority of the daily FX flow is accounted for by corporations  and individuals buying and selling foreign goods and services  Huge investment pools and  professional traders are accounting for a large and growing proportion of the FX business

2,471,Market Participants and Composition of  Trades
3,471,The investment adviser based in Sydney Australia makes the following statements to  her client when describing some of the basic characteristics of the foreign exchange  market 
4,471,Statement  
5,471, Foreign exchange transactions for spot settlement see the most  trade volume in terms of average daily turnover because the FX  market is primarily focused on settling international trade flows  
6,471,Statement  
7,471, The most important foreign exchange market participants on the  buy side are corporations engaged in international trade  on the sell  side they are the local banks that service their FX needs  
8,471,   Statement   is 
9,471,A  correct 
10,471,B  incorrect with respect to the importance of spot settlements 
11,471,C  incorrect both with respect to the importance of spot settlements and  international trade flows 
12,471,   Statement   is 
13,471,A  correct 
14,471,B  incorrect with respect to corporations engaged in international trade 
15,471,C  incorrect with respect to both corporations and the local banks that service  their trade needs 
16,471,Solution to   
17,471,C is correct  Although the media generally focus on the spot market when discussing  foreign exchange the majority of average daily trade volume involves the FX swap  market as market participants either roll over or modify their existing hedging and  speculative positions  or engage in FX swap financing   Although it is true that all  international trade transactions eventually result in some form of spot settlement this  typically generates a great deal of hedging  and speculative  activity in advance of spot  settlement  Moreover an important group of FX market participants engages in purely  speculative positioning with no intention of ever delivering receiving the principal  amount of the trades  Most FX trading volume is not related to international trade   Portfolio flows  cross border capital movements  and speculative activities dominate

2,472,Solution to   
3,472,C is correct  As of      the most important foreign exchange market participants in  terms of average daily turnover are found not among corporations engaged in  international trade but among huge investment managers both private  e g  pension  funds  and public  e g  central bank reserve managers or sovereign wealth funds   A  large and growing amount of daily turnover is also being generated by high frequency  traders who use computer algorithms to automatically execute extremely high numbers  of speculative trades  although their individual ticket sizes are generally small they add  up to large aggregate flows   On the sell side the largest money center banks  e g   Deutsche Bank Citigroup HSBC UBS  are increasingly dominating the amount of  trading activity routed through dealers  Regional and local banks are increasingly being  marginalized in terms of their share of average daily turnover in FX markets 
4,472,   CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE  CALCULATIONS
5,472,     Exchange Rate Quotations
6,472,Exchange rates represent the relative price of one currency in terms of another  This price can  be represented in two ways     currency A buys how many units of currency B  or    currency  B buys how many units of currency A  Of course these two prices are simply the inverse of  each other 
7,472,To distinguish between these two prices market participants sometimes distinguish between  direct and indirect exchange rates  In the quoting convention A B  where there is a certain  number of units of currency A per one unit of currency B  we refer to currency A as the price  currency  or quote currency   currency B is referred to as the base currency   The reason for  this choice of names will become clearer below   The base currency is always set at a quantity  of one  A direct currency quote takes the domestic country as the price currency and the foreign  country as the base currency  For example for a Paris based trader the domestic currency  would be the euro  EUR  and a foreign currency would be the UK pound  GBP   For this Paris  based trader a direct quote would be EUR GBP  An exchange rate quote of EUR GBP           means that   GBP costs        EUR  For this Paris based trader an indirect quote has  the domestic currency the euro as the base currency  An indirect quote of GBP EUR           means that   EUR costs        GBP  Direct and indirect quotes are just the inverse   reciprocal  of each other 
8,472,It can be confusing to describe exchange rates as either being direct or indirect because  determining the domestic currency and the foreign currency depends on where one is located   For a London based market participant the UK pound  GBP  is the domestic currency and the  euro  EUR  is a foreign currency  For a Paris based market participant it would be the other  way around

2,473,To avoid confusion the professional FX market has developed a set of market conventions that  all market participants typically adhere to when making and asking for FX quotes  Exhibit   displays some of these for the major currencies  the currency code used for obtaining exchange  rate quotes how the market lingo refers to this currency pair and the actual ratio price  currency per unit of base currency represented by the quote

2,474,Several things should be noted in this exhibit  First the three letter currency codes in the first  column  for FX rate quotes  refer to what are considered the major exchange rates  Remember  that an exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another  There are always two  currencies involved in the price  This is different from referring to a single currency in its own  right  For example one can refer to the euro  EUR  as a currency  but if we refer to a euro  exchange rate  EUR  it is always the price of the euro in terms of another currency in this case  the US dollar  This is because in the professional FX market the three letter code EUR is  always taken to refer to the euro US dollar exchange rate which is quoted in terms of the  number of US dollars per euro  USD EUR   Second where there are six letter currency codes  in the first column these refer to some of the major cross rates  This topic will be covered in  the next section but generally these are secondary exchange rates and they are not as common  as the main exchange rates   It can be noted that three letter codes are always in terms of an  exchange rate involving the US dollar while the six letter codes are not   Third when both  currencies are mentioned in the code or the name convention the base currency is always  mentioned first the opposite order of the actual ratio  price currency base currency   Thus the  code for  Sterling yen  is  GBPJPY  but the actual number quoted is the number of yen per  sterling  JPY GBP   It should also be noted that the codes may appear in a variety of formats  that all mean the same thing  For example GBPJPY might instead appear as GBP JPY or GBP  JPY  Fourth regardless of where a market participant is located there is always a mix of direct  and indirect quotes in common market usage  For example a trader based in Toronto will  typically refer to the euro Canada and Canada yen exchange rates a mixture of direct   CAD EUR  and indirect  JPY CAD  quotes for a Canadian based trader  There is no overall  consistency in this mixture of direct and indirect quoting conventions in the professional FX  market  a market participant just has to get familiar with how the conventions are used  
3,474,Another concept involving exchange rate quotes in professional FX markets is that of a two  sided price  When a client asks a bank for an exchange rate quote the bank will provide a   bid   the price at which the bank is willing to buy the currency  and an  offer   the price at  which the bank is willing to sell the currency   But there are two currencies involved in an  exchange rate quote which is always the price of one currency relative to the other  So which  one is being bought and sold in this two sided price quote  This is where the lingo involving the  price currency  or quote currency  and the base currency explained above becomes useful  The  two sided price quoted by the dealer is in terms of buying selling the base currency  It shows  the number of units of the price currency that the client will receive from the dealer for one unit  of the base currency  the bid  and the number of units of the price currency that the client must  sell to the dealer to obtain one unit of the base currency  the offer   Consider the case of a client  that is interested in a transaction involving the Swiss franc  CHF  and the euro  EUR   As we  have seen above the market convention is to quote this as euro Swiss  CHF EUR   The EUR is  the base currency and the two sided quote  price  shows the number of units of the price  currency  CHF  that must be paid or will be received for   euro  For example a two sided price  in euro Swiss  CHF EUR  might look like                 The client will receive CHF        for selling EUR  to the dealer and must pay CHF       to the dealer to buy EUR   Note that  the price is shown in terms of the price currency and that the bid is always less than the offer   The bank buys the base currency  EUR in this case  at the low price and sells the base currency  at the high price  Buying low and selling high is profitable for banks and spreading  clients trying to widen the bid offer spread is how dealers try to increase their profit  margins  However it should be noted that the electronic dealing systems currently used in  professional FX markets are extremely efficient in connecting buyers and sellers globally   Moreover this worldwide competition for business has compressed most bid offer spreads to  very tight levels  For simplicity in the remainder of this reading we will focus on exchange  rates as a single number  with no bid offer spread

2,475,One last thing that can be pointed out in exchange rate quoting conventions is that most major  spot exchange rates are typically quoted to four decimal places  One exception among the major  currencies involves the yen for which spot exchange rates are usually quoted to two decimal  places   For example using spot exchange rates from the middle of      a USD EUR quote  would be expressed as        while a JPY EUR quote would be expressed as          This  difference involving the yen comes from the fact that the units of yen per unit of other  currencies is typically relatively large already and hence extending the exchange rate quote to  four decimal places is viewed as unnecessary 
3,475,Regardless of what quoting convention is used changes in an exchange rate can be expressed as  a percentage appreciation of one currency against the other  One simply has to be careful in  identifying which currency is the price currency and which is the base currency  For example  let s suppose the exchange rate for the euro  USD EUR  increases from        to         This  represents an  un annualized  percentage change of 
4,475,             
5,475,           
6,475,This represents a   percent appreciation in the euro against the US dollar  and not an  appreciation of the US dollar against the euro  because the USD EUR exchange rate is  expressed with the dollar as the price currency 
7,475,Note that this appreciation of the euro against the US dollar can also be expressed as a  depreciation of the US dollar against the euro  but in this case the depreciation is not equal to      percent  Inverting the exchange rate quote from USD EUR to EUR USD so that the euro is  now the price currency leads to 
8,475,   
9,475,      
10,475,     
11,475,      
12,475,     
13,475,             
14,475,            
15,475,Note that the US dollar depreciation is not the same in percentage terms as the euro  appreciation  This will always be true  it is simply a matter of arithmetic 
16,475,EXAMPLE  
17,475,Exchange Rate Conventions
18,475,A dealer based in New York City provides a spot exchange rate quote of          MXN USD to a client in Mexico City  The inverse of         is        
19,475,   From the perspective of the Mexican client the most accurate statement is that  the 
20,475,A  direct exchange rate quotation is equal to        
21,475,B  direct exchange rate quotation is equal to         
22,475,C  indirect exchange rate quotation is equal to         
23,475,   If the bid offer quote from the dealer was                   MXN USD then the  bid offer quote in USD MXN terms would be closest to

3,476,B                    
4,476,C                    
5,476,Solution to   
6,476,B is correct  A direct exchange rate uses the domestic currency as the price currency and  the foreign currency as the base currency  For an MXN USD quote the MXN is the  price currency  therefore the direct quote for the Mexican client is          it costs          pesos to purchase   US dollar   Another way of understanding a direct exchange rate quote is that it is the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of your  own currency  This purchase of a unit of foreign currency can be thought of as a  purchase much like any other you might make  think of the unit of foreign currency as  just another item that you might be purchasing with your domestic currency  For  example for someone based in Canada a liter of milk currently costs about CAD      and USD  costs about CAD      This direct currency quote uses the domestic currency   the Canadian dollar in this case  as the price currency and simply gives the price of a  unit of foreign currency that is being purchased 
7,476,Solution to   
8,476,A is correct  An MXN USD quote means the amount of MXN the dealer is bidding   offering  to buy  sell  USD   The dealer s bid to buy USD  at MXN        is  equivalent to the dealer paying MXN        to buy USD   Dividing both terms by          means the dealer is paying  i e  selling  MXN  to buy USD         This is the  offer in USD MXN terms  The dealer offers to sell MXN  at a price of USD         In  USD MXN terms the dealer s bid for MXN  is         calculated by inverting the  offer of         in MXN USD terms                        Note that in any bid offer  quote no matter what the base or price currencies the bid is always lower than the offer 
9,476,     Cross Rate Calculations
10,476,Given two exchange rates involving three currencies it is possible to back out what the cross  rate must be  For example as we have seen the FX market convention is to quote the exchange  rate between the US dollar and the euro as euro dollar  USD EUR   The FX market also quotes  the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and US dollar as dollar Canada  CAD USD    Given these two exchange rates it is possible to back out the cross rate between the euro and  the Canadian dollar which according to market convention is quoted as euro Canada   CAD EUR   This calculation is shown as 
11,476,CAD USD
12,476, 
13,476,USD EUR
14,476, 
15,476,CAD USD
16,476, 
17,476,USD EUR
18,476, 
19,476,CAD EUR
20,476,Hence to get a euro Canada  CAD EUR  quote we must multiply the dollar Canada   CAD USD  quote by the euro dollar  USD EUR  quote  For example assume the exchange  rate for dollar Canada is        and the exchange rate for euro dollar is         Using these  sample spot exchange rates calculating the euro Canada cross rate equals

2,477,                         CAD per EUR
3,477,It is best to avoid talking in terms of direct or indirect quotes because as noted above these  conventions depend on where one is located and hence what the domestic and foreign  currencies are  Instead focus on how the math works  Sometimes it is necessary to invert one of  the quotes in order to get the intermediary currency to cancel out in the equation to get the  cross rate  For example to get a Canada yen  JPY CAD  quote one is typically using the  dollar Canada  CAD USD  rate and dollar yen  JPY USD  rate which are the market  conventions  This Canada yen calculation requires that the dollar Canada rate  CAD USD  be  inverted to a USD CAD quote for the calculations to work as shown below 
4,477, 
5,477,CAD USD

14,477,USD CAD
15,477, 
16,477,JPY USD
17,477, 
18,477,JPY CAD
19,477,Hence to get a Canada yen  JPY CAD  quote we must first invert the dollar Canada   CAD USD  quote before multiplying by the dollar yen  JPY USD  quote  As an example let s  assume that we have spot exchange rates of        for dollar Canada  CAD USD  and        for dollar yen  JPY USD   The dollar Canada rate of        inverts to         multiplying this  value by the dollar yen quote of       gives a Canada yen quote of 
20,477,                       JPY per CAD
21,477,Market participants asking for a quote in a cross rate currency pair typically will not have to do  this calculation themselves  Either the dealer or the electronic trading platform will provide a  quote in the specified currency pair   For example a client asking for a quote in Canada yen  will receive that quote from the dealer  he will not be given separate dollar Canada and dollar  yen quotes in order to do the math   But be aware that dealers providing the quotes often have  to do this calculation themselves if only because the dollar Canada and dollar yen currency  pairs often trade on different trading desks and involve different traders  Electronic dealing  machines used in both the interbank market and bank to client markets often provide this  mathematical operation to calculate cross rates automatically 
22,477,Because market participants can receive both a cross rate quote  for example Canada yen  as  well as the component underlying exchange rate quotes  for example dollar Canada and dollar  yen  these cross rate quotes must be consistent with the above equation  otherwise the market  will arbitrage the mispricing  Extending our example above we calculate a Canada yen   JPY CAD  rate of       based on underlying dollar Canada  CAD USD  and dollar yen   JPY USD  rates of        and       respectively  Now suppose that at the same time a  misguided dealer quotes a Canada yen rate of        This is a different price in JPY CAD for  an identical service  converting yen into Canadian dollars  Hence any trader could buy CAD   at the lower price of JPY      and then turn around and sell CAD  at JPY       recall our  earlier discussion of how price and base currencies are defined   The riskless arbitrage profit is  JPY     per CAD   The arbitrage called triangular arbitrage  tri   because it involves three  currencies would continue until the price discrepancy was removed 
23,477,In reality however these discrepancies in cross rates almost never occur because both human  traders and automatic trading algorithms are constantly on alert for any pricing inefficiencies  In  practice and for the purposes of this reading we can consider cross rates as being consistent  with their underlying exchange rate quotes and that given any two exchange rates involving  three currencies we can back out the third cross rate

8,480,Solution to   
9,480,C is correct  Because the question does not require calculating the magnitude of the  appreciation or depreciation we can work with CHF as either the price currency or the  base currency  In this case it is easiest to use it as the price currency  According to the  table CHF USD is expected to decline from        to        so CHF is expected to be  stronger  i e  it should appreciate against the USD   CHF EUR is currently         see  the solution to problem    and is expected to be                            so CHF is  expected to appreciate against the EUR  CHF GBP is currently                             and is expected to be                            so CHF is also expected to  appreciate against the GBP 
10,480,Alternatively we can derive this answer intuitively  The table shows that the CHF USD  rate is expected to decline  That is the USD is expected to depreciate against the CHF  or alternatively the CHF is expected to appreciate against the USD  The table also  shows that the USD EUR and USD GBP rates are also decreasing meaning that the  EUR and GBP are expected to depreciate against the USD or alternatively the USD is  expected to appreciate against the EUR and GBP  If the CHF is expected to appreciate  against the USD and the USD is expected to appreciate against both the EUR and GBP  it follows that the CHF is expected to appreciate against both the EUR and GBP 
11,480,Solution to   
12,480,A is correct  According to the table USD EUR is expected to decline from        to         while USD GBP is expected to decline from        to         So the USD is  expected to be stronger than both the EUR and GBP  GBP EUR is currently                                 and is expected to be                                so the GBP is  expected to be stronger than the EUR 
13,480,Solution to   
14,480,B is correct  The USD EUR rate depreciates by      percent                          which is the depreciation of the base currency EUR against the USD  The USD GBP  rate declines      percent                         which is the depreciation of the GBP  against the USD  Inverting the CHF USD rate to a USD CHF convention shows that the  base currency CHF appreciates by      percent against the USD

2,481,     Forward Calculations
3,481,In professional FX markets forward exchange rates are typically quoted in terms of points  also  sometimes referred to as  pips    The points on a forward rate quote are simply the difference  between the forward exchange rate quote and the spot exchange rate quote with the points  scaled so that they can be related to the last decimal in the spot quote  When the forward rate is  higher than the spot rate the points are positive and the base currency is said to be trading at a  forward premium  Conversely if the forward rate is less than the spot rate the points  forward  rate minus spot rate  are negative and the base currency is said to be trading at a forward  discount  Of course if the base currency is trading at a forward premium then the price  currency is trading at a forward discount and vice versa 
4,481,This can best be explained by means of an example  At one point during      the spot euro  dollar exchange rate  USD EUR  was        and the one year forward rate was           Hence the forward rate was trading at a discount to the spot rate  the forward rate was smaller  than the spot rate  and the one year forward points were quoted as        This       comes  from 
5,481,                           
6,481,Recall that most non yen exchange rates are quoted to four decimal places so in this case we  would scale up by four decimal places  multiply by        so that this          would be  represented as       points  Notice that the points are scaled to the size of the last digit in the  spot exchange rate quote usually the fourth decimal place  Notice as well that points are  typically quoted to one  or more  decimal places meaning that the forward rate will typically be  quoted to five or more decimal places  The exception among the major currencies is the yen  which is typically quoted to two decimal places for spot rates  Here forward points are scaled  up by two decimal places the last digit in the spot rate quote by multiplying the difference  between forward and spot rates by     
7,481,Typically quotes for forward rates are shown as the number of forward points at each  maturity   These forward points are also called swap points because an FX swap consists of  simultaneous spot and forward transactions  In the middle of      a trader would have faced a  spot rate and forward points in the euro dollar  USD EUR  currency pair similar to those in

2,482,Notice that the absolute number of points generally increases with maturity  This is because the  number of points is proportional to the yield differential between the two countries  the  Eurozone and the United States in this case  scaled by the term to maturity  Given the interest  rate differential the longer the term to maturity the greater the absolute number of forward  points  Similarly given the term to maturity a wider interest rate differential implies a greater  absolute number of forward points   This will be explained and demonstrated in more detail  later in this section  
3,482,To convert any of these quoted forward points into a forward rate one would divide the number  of points by        to scale down to the fourth decimal place the last decimal place in the spot  quote  and then add the result to the spot exchange rate quote   For example using the data in  Exhibit   the three month forward rate in this case would be 
4,482,          
5,482,          
6,482,                              
7,482,Occasionally one will see the forward rate or forward points represented as a percentage of the  spot rate rather than as an absolute number of points  Continuing our example from above the  three month forward rate for USD EUR can be represented as 
8,482,                         
9,482,       
10,482,               
11,482,               
12,482,This shows that either the forward rate or the forward points can be used to calculate the  percentage discount  or premium  in the forward market in this case        percent rounding  to three decimal places  To convert a spot quote into a forward quote when the points are shown  as a percentage one simply multiples the spot rate by one plus the percentage premium or  discount 
13,482,                                                               
14,482,Note that rounded to the fifth decimal place this is equal to our previous calculation  However  it is typically the case in professional FX markets that forward rates will be quoted in terms of  pips rather than percentages 
15,482,We now turn to the relationship between spot rates forward rates and interest rates and how  their relationship is derived  Forward exchange rates are based on an arbitrage relationship that  equates the investment return on two alternative but equivalent investments  Consider the case  of an investor with funds to invest  For simplicity we will assume that there is one unit of the  investor s domestic currency to be invested for one period  One alternative is to invest for one  period at the domestic risk free rate  id   at the end of the period the amount of funds held is  equal to      id   An alternative investment is to convert this one unit of domestic currency to  foreign currency using the spot rate of Sf d  number of units of foreign currency per one unit of  domestic currency   This can be invested for one period at the foreign risk free rate  at the end  of the period the investor would have Sf d     if  units of foreign currency  These funds must  then be converted back to the investor s domestic currency  If the exchange rate to be used for  this end of period conversion was pre contracted at the start of the period  i e  a forward rate  was used  it would eliminate any foreign exchange risk from converting at a future unknown  spot rate  Given the assumed exchange rate convention here  foreign domestic  the investor  would obtain    Ff d  units of the domestic currency for each unit of foreign currency sold  forward  Note that this process of converting domestic funds in the spot FX market investing at  the foreign risk free rate and then converting back to the domestic currency with a forward rate  is identical to the concept of swap financing described in an earlier section of this reading

2,483,Hence we have two alternative investments both risk free because both are invested at risk  free interest rates and because any foreign exchange risk was eliminated  hedged  by using a  forward rate  Because these two investments are equal in risk characteristics they must have the  same return  Bearing in mind that the currency quoting convention is the number of foreign  currency units per single domestic unit  f d  this relationship can be stated as 
3,483,     id     Sf  d      if    
4,483, 
5,483,Ff  d
6,483, 
7,483,This is an arbitrage relationship because it describes two alternative investments  one on either  side of the equal sign  that should have equal returns  If they do not a riskless arbitrage  opportunity exists because an investor can sell short the investment with the lower return and  invest the funds in the investment with the higher return  the difference between the two returns  is pure profit  
8,483,This formula is perhaps the easiest and most intuitive way to remember the formula for the  forward rate because it is based directly on the underlying intuition  the arbitrage relationship of  two alternative but equivalent investments one on either side of the equal sign   Also the right  hand side of the equation for the hedged foreign investment alternative is arranged in proper  time sequence  a  convert domestic to foreign currency  then b  invest the foreign currency at  the foreign interest rate  and finally c  convert the foreign currency back to the domestic  currency  
9,483,This arbitrage equation can be re arranged as needs require  For example to get the formula for  the forward rate the above equation can be restated as 
10,483,Ff  d   Sf  d  
11,483,    if     id
12,483, 
13,483,Another way of looking at this is given the spot exchange rate and the domestic and foreign  risk free interest rates the forward rate is whatever value completes this equation and  eliminates any arbitrage opportunity  For example let s assume that the spot exchange rate  Sf d   is        the domestic    month risk free rate is      percent and the foreign    month risk  free rate is      percent  The    month forward rate  Ff d  must then be equal to 
14,483,        
15,483,             
16,483,          
17,483,Suppose instead that with the spot exchange rate and interest rates unchanged you were given  a quote on the    month forward rate  Ff d  of         Because this misquoted forward rate does  not agree with the arbitrage equation it would present a riskless arbitrage opportunity  This can  be seen by using the arbitrage equation to compute the return on the two alternative investment  strategies  The return on the domestic only investment approach is the domestic risk free rate        percent   In contrast the return on the hedged foreign investment when this misquoted  forward rate is put into the arbitrage equation equals

2,484,This defines a return of      percent  Hence the investor could make riskless arbitrage profits  by borrowing at the higher foreign risk free rate selling the foreign currency at the spot  exchange rate hedging the currency exposure  buying the foreign currency back  at the  misquoted forward rate investing the funds at the lower domestic risk free rate and thereby  getting a profit of    basis points                 for each unit of domestic currency  involved all with no upfront commitment of the investor s own capital  Any such opportunity  in real world financial markets would be quickly  arbed  away  It is interesting to note that in  this example the investor actually borrows at the higher of the two interest rates but makes a  profit because the foreign currency is underpriced in the forward market 
3,484,The underlying arbitrage equation can also be re arranged to show the forward rate as a  percentage of the spot rate

5,484,Sf  d
6,484,   
7,484,    if     id
8,484, 
9,484,This shows that given an f d quoting convention the forward rate will be higher than  be at a  premium to  the spot rate if foreign interest rates are higher than domestic interest rates  More  generally and regardless of the quoting convention the currency with the higher  lower   interest rate will always trade at a discount  premium  in the forward market 
10,484,One context in which forward rates are quoted as a percentage of spot rates occurs when  forward rates are interpreted as expected future spot rates or

23,484, 
24,484,This shows that if forward rates are interpreted as expected future spot rates the expected  percentage change in the spot rate is proportional to the interest rate differential  if   id  
25,484,It is intuitively appealing to see forward rates as expected future spot rates  However this  interpretation of forward rates should be used cautiously  First the direction of the expected  change in spot rates is somewhat counter intuitive  All else being equal an increase in domestic  interest rates  for example the central bank tightens monetary policy  would typically be  expected to lead to an increase in the value of the domestic currency  In contrast the equation  above indicates that all else equal a higher domestic interest rate implies slower expected  appreciation  or greater expected depreciation  of the domestic currency  recall that this  equation is based on an f d quoting convention

2,485,More important historical data show that forward rates are poor predictors of future spot rates   Although various econometric studies suggest that forward rates may be unbiased predictors of  future spot rates  i e  they do not systematically over  or under estimate future spot rates  this  is not particularly useful information because the margin of error for these forecasts is so large   As we have seen in our introductory section the FX market is far too complex and dynamic to  be captured by a single variable such as the level of the yield differential between countries   Moreover as can be seen in the formula above for the forward rate forward rates are based on  domestic and foreign interest rates  This means that anything that affects the level and shape of  the yield curve in either the domestic or foreign market will also affect the relationship between  spot and forward exchange rates  In other words FX markets do not operate in isolation but will  reflect almost all factors affecting other markets globally  anything that affects expectations or  risk premia in these other markets will reverberate in forward exchange rates as well  Although  the level of the yield differential is one factor that the market may look at in forming spot  exchange rate expectations it is only one of many factors   Many traders look to the trend in the  yield differential rather than the level of the differential   Moreover there is a lot of noise in FX  markets that makes almost any model no matter how complex a relatively poor predictor of  spot rates at any given point in the future  In practice FX traders and market strategists do not base either their currency expectations or trading strategies solely on forward rates 
3,485,For the purposes of this reading it is best to understand forward exchange rates simply as a  product of the arbitrage equation outlined earlier and forward points as being related to the   time scaled  interest rate differential between the two countries  Reading any more than that  into forward rates or interpreting them as the  market forecast  can be potentially misleading 
4,485,To understand the relationship between maturity and forward points we need to generalize our  arbitrage formula slightly  Suppose the investment horizon is a fraction   of the period for  which the interest rates are quoted  Then the interest earned in the domestic and foreign markets  would be  id    and  if    respectively  Substituting this into our arbitrage relationship and  solving for the difference between the forward and spot exchange rates gives 
5,485,Ff  d   Sf  d   Sf  d  
6,485,if   id     id  
7,485,   
8,485,This equation shows that forward points  appropriately scaled  are proportional to the spot  exchange rate and to the interest rate differential and approximately  but not exactly   proportional to the horizon of the forward contract 
9,485,Let s demonstrate this using an example  Suppose that we wanted to determine the    day  forward exchange rate given a    day domestic risk free interest rate of      percent per year a     day foreign risk free interest rate of      percent per year and a spot exchange rate  Sf d  of          The risk free assets used in this arbitrage relationship are typically bank deposits quoted  using the London Interbank Offered Rate  Libor  for the currencies involved  The day count  convention for Libor deposits is Actual       Incorporating the fractional period     as above  and inserting the data into the forward rate equation leads to a    day forward rate of 
10,485,Ff  d   Sf  d  
11,485,    if       id  
12,485,                                          
13,485,               
14,485,              
15,485,This means that for a    day term forward rates are trading at a premium of    pips                     This can also be calculated using the above formula for swap points

9,486,As should be clear from this expression the absolute number of swap points will be closely  related to the term of the forward contract  i e  approximately proportional to     Actual        For example leaving the spot exchange rate and interest rates unchanged let s set the term of  the forward contract to     days

12,486,       
13,486,       
14,486,          
15,486,This leads to the forward rate trading at a premium of    pips  The increase in the number of  forward points is approximately proportional to the increase in the term of the contract  from     days to     days   Note that although the term of the     day forward contract is six times  longer than that of a    day contract the number of forward points is not exactly six times  larger              
16,486,Similarly the number of forward points is proportional to the spread between foreign and  domestic interest rates  if   id   For example with reference to the original    day forward  contract let s set the foreign interest rate to      percent leaving the domestic interest rate and  spot exchange rate unchanged  This doubles the interest rate differential  if   id  from       percent to      percent  it also doubles the forward points  rounding to four decimal places

4,487,B  one month UK interest rates are higher than those in the Eurozone 
5,487,C  one month Eurozone interest rates are higher than those in the United  Kingdom

14,487,   If the     day Libor rates  annualized  for the EUR and GBP are        and         respectively and the spot GBP EUR exchange rate is        then the  number of forward points for a     day forward rate  FGBP EUR  is closest to

20,487,Solution to   
21,487,C is correct  A forward discount indicates that interest rates in the base currency country   France in this case which uses the euro  are higher than those in the price currency  country  the United Kingdom

2,488,Solution to   
3,488,A is correct  The number of forward points is equal to the scaled difference between the  forward rate and the spot rate  In this case                                This is then  multiplied by       to convert to the number of forward points 
4,488,Solution to   
5,488,B is correct  A      percent discount means that the second dealer will sell euros     months forward at                                 a lower price per euro than the  original dealer s quote of          Buying euros at the cheaper    month forward rate            and selling the same amount of euros    months forward at the higher     month forward rate           means a profit of                      GBP          per  euro transacted receivable when both forward contracts settle in    months

34,488,   EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES
35,488,Highly volatile exchange rates create uncertainty that undermines the efficiency of real  economic activity and the financial transactions required to facilitate that activity  Exchange  rate volatility also has a direct impact on investment decisions because it is a key component of  the risk inherent in foreign  i e  foreign currency denominated  assets  Exchange rate volatility  is also a critical factor in selecting hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures

2,489,The amount of foreign exchange rate volatility will depend at least in part on the institutional  and policy arrangements associated with trade in any given currency  Virtually every exchange  rate is managed to some degree by central banks  The policy framework that each central bank  adopts is called an exchange rate regime  Although there are many potential variations these  regimes fall into a few general categories  Before describing each of these types we consider  the possibility of an ideal regime and provide some historical perspective on the evolution of  currency arrangements 
3,489,     The Ideal Currency Regime
4,489,The ideal currency regime would have three properties  First the exchange rate between any  two currencies would be credibly fixed  This would eliminate currency related uncertainty with  respect to the prices of goods and services as well as real and financial assets  Second all  currencies would be fully convertible  i e  currencies could be freely exchanged for any  purpose and in any amount   This condition ensures unrestricted flow of capital  Third each  country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit of domestic  objectives such as growth and inflation targets 
5,489,Unfortunately these three conditions are not consistent  If the first two conditions were  satisfied credibly fixed exchange rates and full convertibility then there would really be only  one currency in the world  Converting from one national currency to another would have no  more significance  indeed less  than deciding whether to carry coins or paper currency in your  wallet  Any attempt to influence interest rates asset prices or inflation by adjusting the supply  of one currency versus another would be futile  Thus it should be clear that independent  monetary policy is not possible if exchange rates are credibly fixed and currencies are fully  convertible  There can be no ideal currency regime 
6,489,The impact of the currency regime on a country s ability to exercise independent monetary  policy is a recurring theme in open economy macroeconomics  It will be covered in more detail  in other readings  however it is worthwhile to emphasize the basic point by considering what  would happen in an idealized world of perfect capital mobility  If the exchange rate were  credibly fixed then any attempt to decrease default free interest rates in one country below  those in another that is to undertake independent expansionary monetary policy would  result in a potentially unlimited outflow of capital because funds would seek the higher return   The central bank would be forced to sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency to  maintain the fixed exchange rate  The loss of reserves and reduction in the domestic money  supply would put upward pressure on domestic interest rates until rates were forced back to  equality negating the initial expansionary policy  Similarly contractionary monetary policy   higher interest rates  would be thwarted by an inflow of capital 
7,489,The situation is quite different however with a floating exchange rate  A decrease in the  domestic interest rate would make the domestic currency less attractive  The resulting  depreciation of the domestic currency would shift demand toward domestically produced goods   i e  exports rise and imports fall  reinforcing the expansionary impact of the initial decline in  the interest rate  Similarly a contractionary increase in the interest rate would be reinforced by  appreciation of the domestic currency

2,490,In practice of course capital is not perfectly mobile and the impact on monetary policy is not  so stark  The fact remains however that fixed exchange rates limit the scope for independent  monetary policy and that national monetary policy regains potency and independence at least to  some degree if the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate and or restrictions are placed on  convertibility  In general the more freely the exchange rate is allowed to float and the more  tightly convertibility is controlled the more effective the central bank can be in addressing  domestic macroeconomic objectives  The downside of course is the potential distortion of  economic activity caused by exchange rate risk and inefficient allocation of financial capital 
3,490,     Historical Perspective on Currency Regimes
4,490,How currencies exchange for one another has evolved over the centuries  At any point in time  different exchange rate systems may coexist  still there tends to be one dominant system in the  world economy  Throughout most of the   th century and the early   th century until the start  of World War I the US dollar and the UK pound sterling operated on the  classical gold  standard   The price of each currency was fixed in terms of gold  Gold was the numeraire   for  each currency  therefore it was indirectly the numeraire for all other prices in the economy   Many countries  e g  the colonies of the United Kingdom  fixed their currencies relative to  sterling and were therefore implicitly also operating on the classical gold standard 
5,490,The classical gold standard operated by what is called the price specie flow mechanism  This  mechanism operated through the impact of trade imbalances on capital flows namely gold  As  countries experienced a trade surplus they accumulated gold as payment their domestic money  supply expanded by the amount dictated by the fixed parity prices rose and exports fell   Similarly when a country ran a trade deficit there was an automatic outflow of gold a  contraction of the domestic money supply and a fall in prices leading to increased exports 
6,490,In this system national currencies were backed by gold  A country could only print as much  money as its gold reserve warranted  The system was limited by the amount of gold but it was  self adjusting and inspired confidence  With a fixed stock of gold the price specie flow  mechanism would work well  Still new gold discoveries as well as more efficient methods of  refining gold would enable a country to increase its gold reserves and increase its money supply  apart from the effect of trade flows  In general however trade flows drove changes in national  money supplies   
7,490,There is much disagreement among economic historians about the effect of the classical gold  standard on overall macroeconomic stability  Was it destabilizing  On the one hand monetary  policy was tied to trade flows so a country could not engage in expansionary policies when  there was a downturn in the non traded sector  On the other hand it has been argued that tying  monetary policy to trade flows kept inflation in check 
8,490,During the     s the use of gold as a clearing device for settlement of trade imbalances  combined with increasing protectionism on the part of economies struggling with depression as  well as episodes of deflation and hyperinflation created a chaotic environment for world trade   As a consequence of these factors world trade dropped by over    percent and the gold  standard was abandoned

2,491,In the later stages of World War II a new system of fixed exchange rates with periodic  realignments was devised by John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White representing the  UK and US Treasuries respectively  The Bretton Woods system named after the town where it  was negotiated was adopted by    countries in       From the end of the war until the collapse  of the system in the early     s the United States Japan and most of the industrialized  countries of Europe maintained a system of fixed parities for exchange rates between  currencies  When the parities were significantly and persistently out of line with the balancing  of supply and demand there would be a realignment of currencies with some appreciating in  value and others depreciating in value  These periodic realignments were viewed as a part of  standard monetary policy 
3,491,By      with chronic inflation taking hold throughout the world most nations abandoned the  Bretton Woods system in favor of a flexible exchange rate system under what are known as the  Smithsonian Agreements  Milton Friedman had called for such a system as far back as the      s    His argument was that the fixed parity system with periodic realignments would  become unsustainable  When the inevitable realignments were imminent large speculative  profit opportunities would appear  Speculators would force the hand of monetary policy  authorities and their actions would distort the data needed to ascertain appropriate trade related  parities  It is better he argued to let the market rather than central bank governors and treasury  ministers determine the exchange rate 
4,491,After      most of the industrialized world changed to a system of flexible exchange rates   The original thinking was that the forces that caused exchange rate chaos in the     s poor  domestic monetary policy and trade barriers would not be present in a flexible exchange rate  regime and therefore exchange rates would move in response to the exchange of goods and  services among countries  As it turned out however exchange rates moved around much more  than anyone expected  Academic economists and financial analysts alike soon realized that the  high degree of exchange rate volatility was the manifestation of a highly liquid forward  looking asset market    Investment driven FX transactions for both long term investment and  short term speculation mattered much more in setting the spot exchange rate than anyone had  previously imagined 
5,491,There are costs of course to a high degree of exchange rate volatility  These include difficulty  planning without hedging exchange rate risks a form of insurance cost domestic price  fluctuations uncertain costs of raw materials and short term interruptions in financing  transactions  For these reasons in      the European Economic Community opted for a system  of limited flexibility the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  ERM  
6,491,Initially the system called for European currency values to fluctuate within a narrow band  called  the snake   This did not last long  The end of the Cold War and the re unification of  Germany created conditions ripe for speculative attack  In the early     s the United Kingdom  was in a recession and the government s monetary policy leaned toward low interest rates to  stimulate economic recovery  Germany was issuing large amounts of debt to pay for re  unification and the German central bank  the Deutsche Bundesbank  opted for high interest  rates to ensure price stability  Capital began to flow from sterling to Deutsche marks to obtain  the higher interest rate  The Bank of England tried to lean against these flows and maintain the  exchange rate within the Exchange Rate Mechanism but eventually it began to run out of marks  to sell  Because it was almost certain that devaluation would be required holders of sterling  rushed to purchase marks at the old rate and the speculative attack forced the United Kingdom  out of the ERM in September      only two years after it finally joined the system

2,492,Despite these difficulties      saw the creation of a common currency for most Western  European countries without Switzerland or the United Kingdom called the euro    The hope  was that the common currency would increase transparency of prices across borders in Europe  enhance market competition and facilitate more efficient allocation of resources  The  drawback of course is that each member country lost the ability to manage its exchange rate  and therefore to engage in independent monetary policy 
3,492,     A Taxonomy of Currency Regimes
4,492,Although the pros and cons of fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes continue to be debated  regimes have been adopted that lie somewhere between these polar cases  In some cases the  driving force is the lack of credibility with respect to sound monetary policy  An economy with  a history of hyperinflation may be forced to adopt a form of fixed rate regime because its  promise to maintain a sound currency with a floating rate regime would not be credible  This  has been a persistent issue in Latin America  In other cases the driving force is as much  political as economic  The decision to create the euro was strongly influenced by the desire to  enhance political union within the European Community whose members had been at war with  each other twice in the   th century 
5,492,As of April      the International Monetary Fund  IMF  classified exchange rate regimes into  the eight categories shown in Exhibit

13,493,It should be noted that global financial markets are too complex and diverse to be fully captured  by this  or any other  classification system  A government s control over the domestic  currency s exchange rate will depend on many factors  for example the degree of capital  controls used to prevent the free flow of funds in and out of the economy  Also even under an   independent float  regime monetary authorities will occasionally intervene in foreign  exchange markets in order to influence the value of their domestic currency  Additionally the  specifics of exchange rate policy implementation are subject to change 
14,493,This means that the classifications in Exhibit   are somewhat arbitrary and subject to  interpretation as well as change over time  The important point to be drawn from this  discussion is that the prices and flows in foreign exchange markets will to varying degrees  reflect the legal and regulatory framework imposed by governments not just  pure  market  forces  Governments have a variety of motives and tools for attempting to manage exchange  rates  The taxonomy in Exhibit   can be used to help understand the main distinctions among  currency regimes and the rationales for adopting them but the specific definitions should not be  interpreted too rigidly  Instead the focus should be on the diversity of foreign exchange markets  globally as well as the implications of these various currency regimes for market pricing

2,494,       Arrangements with No Separate Legal Tender
3,494,The IMF identifies two types of arrangements in which a country does not have its own legal  tender  In the first known as dollarization the country uses the currency of another nation as its  medium of exchange and unit of account  In the second the country participates in a monetary  union whose members share the same legal tender  In either case the country gives up the  ability to conduct its own monetary policy 
4,494,In principle a country could adopt any currency as its medium of exchange and unit of account  but the main reserve currency the US dollar is an obvious choice hence the name  dollarization  Many countries are dollarized  East Timor El Salvador Ecuador and Panama  for example  By adopting another country s currency as legal tender a dollarized country  inherits that country s currency credibility but not its credit worthiness  For example although  local banks may borrow lend and accept deposits in US dollars they are not members of the  US Federal Reserve System nor are they backed by deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation  Thus interest rates on US dollars in a dollarized economy need not be  and generally are not the same as on dollar deposits in the United States 
5,494,Dollarization imposes fiscal discipline by eliminating the possibility that the central bank will  be induced to monetize government debt  i e  to persistently purchase government debt with  newly created local currency   For countries with a history of fiscal excess or lack of monetary  discipline dollarizing the economy can facilitate growth of international trade and capital flows  if it creates an expectation of economic and financial stability  In the process however it  removes another potential source of stabilization domestic monetary policy 
6,494,The European Economic and Monetary Union  EMU  is the most prominent example of the  second type of arrangement lacking separate legal tender  Each EMU member uses the euro as  its currency  Although member countries cannot have their own monetary policies they jointly  determine monetary policy through their representation at the European Central Bank  ECB    As with dollarization a monetary union confers currency credibility on members with a history  of fiscal excess and or a lack of monetary discipline  However as shown by the      EMU  sovereign debt crisis monetary union alone cannot confer credit worthiness 
7,494,       Currency Board System
8,494,The IMF defines a currency board system  CBS  as 
9,494,A monetary regime based on an explicit legislative commitment to exchange  domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate  combined with restrictions on the issuing authority to ensure fulfillment of its legal  obligation  This implies that domestic currency will be issued only against foreign  exchange and it remains fully backed by foreign assets    
10,494,Hong Kong is the leading example of a long standing  since       currency board  US dollar  reserves are held to cover at the fixed parity the entire monetary base essentially bank  reserves plus all HKD notes and coins in circulation    Note that HKD denominated bank  deposits are not fully collateralized by US dollar reserves  to do so would mean that banks  could not lend against their deposits  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority  HKMA  does not  function as a traditional central bank under this system because the obligation to maintain      percent foreign currency reserves against the monetary base prevents it from acting as a lender  of last resort for troubled financial institutions  However it can provide short term liquidity by  lending against foreign currency collateral

2,495,A CBS works much like the classical gold standard in that expansion and contraction of the  monetary base are directly linked to trade and capital flows  As with the gold standard a CBS  works best if domestic prices and wages are very flexible non traded sectors of the domestic  economy are relatively small and the global supply of the reserve asset grows at a slow steady  rate consistent with long run real growth with stable prices  The first two of these conditions are  satisfied in Hong Kong  Until and unless Hong Kong selects a new reserve asset however the  third condition depends on US monetary policy 
3,495,In practice the HKD exhibits modest fluctuations around the official parity of HKD USD         because the HKMA buys  sells  USD at a pre announced level slightly below  above  the  parity  Persistent flows on one side of this convertibility zone or the other result in interest rate  adjustments rather than exchange rate adjustments  Inside the zone however the exchange rate  is determined by the market and the HKMA is free to conduct limited monetary operations  aimed at dampening transitory interest rate movements 
4,495,One of the advantages of a CBS as opposed to dollarization is that the monetary authority can  earn a profit by paying little or no interest on its liability the monetary base and can earn a  market rate on its asset the foreign currency reserves  This profit is called seigniorage    Under dollarization the seigniorage goes to the monetary authority whose currency is used 
5,495,       Fixed Parity
6,495,A simple fixed rate system differs from a CBS in two important respects  First there is no  legislative commitment to maintaining the specified parity  Thus market participants know that  the country may choose to adjust or abandon the parity rather than endure other potentially  more painful adjustments  Second the target level of foreign exchange reserves is  discretionary  it bears no particular relationship to domestic monetary aggregates  Thus  although monetary independence is ultimately limited as long as the exchange peg is  maintained the central bank can carry out traditional functions such as serving as lender of last  resort 
7,495,In the conventional fixed rate system the exchange rate may be pegged to a single  currency for example the US dollar or to a basket index of the currencies of major trading  partners  There is a band of up to    percent around the parity level within which private flows  are allowed to determine the exchange rate  The monetary authority stands ready to spend its  foreign currency reserves or buy foreign currency in order to maintain the rate within these  bands 
8,495,The credibility of the fixed parity depends on the country s willingness and ability to offset  imbalances in private sector demand for its currency  Both excess and deficient private demand  for the currency can exert pressure to adjust or abandon the parity  Excess private demand for  the domestic currency implies a rapidly growing stock of foreign exchange reserves expansion  of the domestic money supply and potentially accelerating inflation  Deficient demand for the  currency depletes foreign exchange reserves and exerts deflationary pressure on the economy  If  market participants believe the foreign exchange reserves are insufficient to sustain the parity  then that belief may be self fulfilling because the resulting speculative attack will drain reserves  and may force an immediate devaluation  Thus the level of reserves required to maintain  credibility is a key issue for a simple fixed exchange rate regime

2,496,       Target Zone
3,496,A target zone regime has a fixed parity with fixed horizontal intervention bands that are  somewhat wider up to    percent around the parity than in the simple fixed parity regime   The wider bands provide the monetary authority with greater scope for discretionary policy 
4,496,       Active and Passive Crawling Pegs
5,496,Crawling pegs for the exchange rate usually against a single currency such as the US  dollar were common in the     s in Latin America particularly Brazil during the high  inflation periods  To prevent a run on the US dollar reserves the exchange rate was adjusted  frequently  weekly or daily  to keep pace with the inflation rate  Such a system was called a  passive crawl  An adaptation used in Argentina Chile and Uruguay was the active crawl  The  exchange rate was pre announced for the coming weeks with changes taking place in small  steps  The aim of the active crawl was to manipulate expectations of inflation  Because the  domestic prices of many goods were directly tied to import prices announced changes in the  exchange rate would effectively signal future changes in the inflation rate of these goods 
6,496,       Fixed Parity with Crawling Bands
7,496,A country can also have a fixed central parity with crawling bands  Initially a country may fix  its rates to a foreign currency to anchor expectations about future inflation but then gradually  permit more and more flexibility in the form of a pre announced widening band around the  central parity  Such a system has the desirable property of allowing a gradual exit strategy from  the fixed parity  A country might want to introduce greater flexibility and greater scope for  monetary policy but it may not yet have the credibility or financial infrastructure for full  flexibility  So it maintains a fixed parity with slowly widening bands 
8,496,       Managed Float
9,496,A country may simply follow an exchange rate policy based on either internal or external policy  targets intervening or not to achieve trade balance price stability or employment objectives   Such a policy often called dirty floating invites trading partners to respond likewise with their  exchange rate policy and potentially decreases stability in foreign exchange markets as a whole   The exchange rate target in terms of either a level or a rate of change is typically not explicit 
10,496,       Independently Floating Rates
11,496,In this case the exchange rate is left to market determination and the monetary authority is able  to exercise independent monetary policy aimed at achieving such objectives as price stability  and full employment  The central bank also has latitude to act as a lender of last resort to  troubled financial institutions if necessary

2,497,It should be clear from recent experience that the concepts of float managed float crawl and  target zone are not hard and fast rules  Central banks do occasionally engage implicitly or  explicitly in regime switches even in countries nominally following an independently floating  exchange rate regime  For example when the US dollar appreciated in the mid     s with  record US trade deficits then US Treasury Secretary James Baker engineered the Plaza Accord  in which Japan and Germany engineered an appreciation of their currencies against the US  dollar   The  Plaza Accord  is so named because it was negotiated at the Plaza Hotel in New  York City   This      policy agreement involved a combination of fiscal and monetary policy  measures by the countries involved as well as direct intervention in foreign exchange markets   The Plaza Accord was a clear departure from a pure independently floating exchange rate  system 
3,497,There are more recent examples of government intervention in foreign exchange markets  In  September      the European Central Bank the Federal Reserve Board the Bank of Japan the  Bank of England and the Bank of Canada engaged in  concerted  intervention in order to  support the value of the euro a  freely floating  currency which was then under pressure within  foreign exchange markets   This intervention was described as  concerted  because it was pre  arranged and coordinated among the central banks involved   During      many countries  engaged in unilateral intervention to prevent the rapid appreciation of their currencies against  the US dollar  Several of these countries also employed various fiscal and regulatory measures   for example taxes on capital inflows  in order to further affect exchange rate movements 
4,497,The important point to draw from this discussion is that exchange rates do not only reflect  private sector market forces but will also to varying degrees be influenced by the legal and  regulatory framework  currency regimes  within which foreign exchange markets operate   Moreover they will occasionally be influenced by government polices  fiscal monetary and  intervention  intended to manage exchange rates  All of these can vary widely among countries  and are subject to change with time 
5,497,Nonetheless the most widely traded currencies in foreign exchange markets  the US dollar  yen euro UK pound Swiss franc and the Canadian and Australian dollars  are typically  considered to be free floating although subject to relatively infrequent intervention

7,497,Currency Regimes
8,497,An investment adviser in Los Angeles USA is meeting with a client who wishes to  diversify her portfolio by including more international investments  In order to evaluate  the suitability of international diversification for the client the adviser attempts to  explain some of the characteristics of foreign exchange markets  The adviser points out  that exchange rate regimes affect the performance of domestic economies as well as the  amount of foreign exchange risk posed by international investments 
9,497,The client and her adviser discuss potential investments in Hong Kong Panama and  Canada  The adviser notes that the currency regimes of Hong Kong Panama and  Canada are a currency board dollarization and a free float respectively  The adviser  tells his client that these regimes imply different degrees of foreign exchange risk for her  portfolio

2,498,The discussion between the investment adviser and his client then turns to potential  investments in other markets with different currency regimes  The adviser notes that  some markets are subject to fixed parity regimes against the US dollar  The client asks  whether a fixed parity regime would imply less foreign currency risk for her portfolio  than would a currency board  The adviser replies   Yes a fixed parity regime means a  constant exchange rate and is more credible than a currency board  
3,498,The adviser goes on to explain that in some markets exchange rates are allowed to vary  although with different degrees of foreign exchange market intervention to limit  exchange rate volatility  Citing examples he notes that China has a crawling peg regime  with reference to the US dollar but the average daily percentage changes in the  China US exchange rate are very small compared with the average daily volatility for a  freely floating currency  The adviser also indicates that Denmark has a target zone  regime with reference to the euro and South Korea usually follows a freely floating  currency regime but sometimes switches to a managed float regime  The currencies of  China Denmark and South Korea are the yuan renminbi  CNY  krone  DKK  and  won  KRW  respectively 
4,498,   Based solely on the exchange rate risk the client would face what is the correct  ranking  from most to least risky  of the following investment locations 
5,498,A  Panama Canada Hong Kong 
6,498,B  Canada Hong Kong Panama 
7,498,C  Hong Kong Panama Canada

9,498,A  Canada 
10,498,B  Panama 
11,498,C  Hong Kong 
12,498,   The adviser s statement about fixed parity regimes is incorrect with regard to 
13,498,A  credibility 
14,498,B  a constant exchange rate 
15,498,C  both a constant exchange rate and credibility 
16,498,   Based on the adviser s categorization of China s currency regime if the USD is  depreciating against the KRW then it is most likely correct that the CNY is 
17,498,A  fixed against the KRW 
18,498,B  appreciating against the KRW 
19,498,C  depreciating against the KRW

5,499,   Based on the adviser s categorization of South Korea s currency policy it would  be most correct to infer that the 
6,499,A  Korean central bank is engineering a gradual exit from a fixed rate regime 
7,499,B  government is attempting to peg the exchange rate within a predefined  zone 
8,499,C  won is allowed to float but with occasional intervention by the Korean  central bank 
9,499,Solution to   
10,499,B is correct  The CAD USD exchange rate is a floating exchange rate and Canadian  investments would therefore carry exchange rate risk for a US based investor  Although  Hong Kong follows a currency board system the HKD USD exchange rate nonetheless  does display some variation albeit much less than in a floating exchange rate regime  In  contrast Panama has a dollarized economy  i e  it uses the US dollar as the domestic  currency   therefore there is no foreign exchange risk for a US investor 
11,499,Solution to   
12,499,A is correct  The Canadian dollar floats independently against the US dollar leaving the  Bank of Canada able to adjust monetary policy to maintain price stability  Neither Hong  Kong  currency board  nor Panama  dollarized  can exercise independent monetary  policy to buffer its economy from the inflationary deflationary consequences of US  monetary policy 
13,499,Solution to   
14,499,C is correct  A fixed exchange rate regime does not mean that the exchange rate is  rigidly fixed at a constant level  In practice both a fixed rate regime and a currency  board allow the exchange rate to vary within a band around the stated parity level  Thus  both regimes involve at least a modest amount of exchange rate risk  The fixed parity  regime exposes the investor to the additional risk that the parity may not be maintained   In a fixed parity regime the level of foreign currency reserves is discretionary and  typically only a small fraction of the domestic money supply  With no legal obligation  to maintain the parity the monetary authority may adjust the parity  devalue or revalue  its currency  or allow its currency to float if doing so is deemed to be less painful than  other adjustment mechanisms  e g  fiscal restraint   In contrast a currency board entails  a legal commitment to maintain the parity and to fully back the domestic currency with  reserve currency assets  Hence there is little risk that the parity will be abandoned

2,500,C is correct  If the CNY is subject to a crawling peg with very small daily adjustments  versus the USD and the USD is depreciating against the KRW then the CNY would  most likely be depreciating against the KRW as well  In fact this was an important issue  in foreign exchange markets through the latter part of       As the USD depreciated  against most Asian currencies  and less so against the CNY  many Asian countries felt  that they were losing their competitive export advantage because the CNY was so  closely tied to the USD  This led many Asian countries to intervene in FX markets  against the strength of their domestic currencies in order not to lose an export pricing  advantage against China 
3,500,Solution to   
4,500,A is correct  A target zone means that the exchange rate between the euro and Danish  krone  DKK  will be allowed to vary within a fixed band  as of      the target zone for  the DKK EUR is a      percent band   This does not mean that the DKK EUR rate is  fixed at a certain level  B is incorrect  or that the target zone will vary in order to  manage inflation expectations  this is a description of a crawling peg which makes C  incorrect  
5,500,Solution to   
6,500,C is correct  Similar to the monetary authorities responsible for many of the world s  major currencies the South Korean policy typically involves letting market forces  determine the exchange rate  an independent floating rate regime   But this approach  does not mean that market forces are the sole determinant of the won exchange rate  As  with most governments the South Korean policy is to intervene in foreign exchange  markets when movements in the exchange rate are viewed as undesirable  a managed  float   For example during the later part of      South Korea and many other countries  intervened in foreign exchange markets to moderate the appreciation of their currencies  against the US dollar  Answer A describes a fixed parity with a crawling bands regime  and B describes a target zone regime  Both answers are incorrect

2,501,   EXCHANGE RATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE  AND CAPITAL FLOWS
3,501,Just as a family that spends more than it earns must borrow or sell assets to finance the excess a  country that imports more goods and services than it exports must borrow from foreigners or  sell assets to foreigners to finance the trade deficit  Conversely a country that exports more  goods and services than it imports must invest the excess either by lending to foreigners or by  buying assets from foreigners  Thus a trade deficit  surplus  must be exactly matched by an  offsetting capital account surplus  deficit     This implies that any factor that affects the trade  balance must have an equal and opposite impact on the capital account and vice versa  To put  this somewhat differently the impact of exchange rates and other factors on the trade balance  must be mirrored by their impact on capital flows  They cannot affect one without affecting the  other 
4,501,Using a fundamental identity from macroeconomics the relationship between the trade balance  and expenditure saving decisions can be expressed as   
5,501,X   M    S   I     T   G 
6,501,where X represents exports M is imports S is private savings I is investment in plant and  equipment T is taxes net of transfers and G is government expenditure  From this relationship  we can see that a trade surplus  X   M  must be reflected in a fiscal surplus  T   G  an excess  of private saving over investment  S   I  or both  Because a fiscal surplus can be viewed as  government saving we can summarize this relationship more simply by saying that a trade  surplus means the country saves more than enough to fund its investment  I  in plant and  equipment  The excess saving is used to accumulate financial claims on the rest of the world   Conversely a trade deficit means the country does not save enough to fund its investment  spending  I  and must reduce its net financial claims on the rest of the world 
7,501,Although this identity provides a key link between real expenditure saving decisions and the  aggregate flow of financial assets into or out of a country it does not tell us what type of  financial assets will be exchanged or in what currency they will be denominated  All that can be  said is that asset prices and exchange rates at home and abroad must adjust so that all financial  assets are willingly held by investors

2,502,If investors anticipate a significant change in an exchange rate they will try to sell the currency  that is expected to depreciate and buy the currency that is expected to appreciate  This implies  an incipient  i e  potential  flow of capital from one country to the other which must either be  accompanied by a simultaneous shift in the trade balance or be discouraged by changes in asset  prices and exchange rates  Because expenditure saving decisions and prices of goods change  much more slowly than financial investment decisions and asset prices most of the adjustment  usually occurs within the financial markets  That is asset prices and exchange rates adjust so  that the potential flow of financial capital is mitigated and actual capital flows remain  consistent with trade flows  In a fixed exchange rate regime the central bank offsets the private  capital flows in the process of maintaining the exchange rate peg and the adjustment occurs in  other asset prices typically interest rates until and unless the central bank is forced to allow the  exchange rate to adjust    In a floating exchange rate regime the main adjustment is often a  rapid change in the exchange rate that dampens an investor s conviction that further movement  will be forthcoming  Thus capital flows potential and actual are the primary determinant of  exchange rate movements in the short to intermediate term  Trade flows become increasingly  important in the longer term as expenditure saving decisions and the prices of goods and  services adjust 
3,502,With the correspondence between the trade balance and capital flows firmly established we can  now examine the impact of exchange rate changes on the trade balance from two perspectives   The first approach focuses on the effect of changing the relative price of domestic and foreign  goods  This approach which is called the elasticities approach highlights changes in the  composition of spending  The second approach called the absorption approach focuses on the  impact of exchange rates on aggregate expenditure saving decisions 
4,502,     Exchange Rates and the Trade Balance  The Elasticities  Approach
5,502,The effectiveness of devaluation  in a fixed system  or depreciation  in a flexible system  of the  currency for reducing a trade deficit depends on well behaved demand and supply curves for  goods and services  The condition that guarantees that devaluations improve the trade balance is  called the Marshall Lerner condition  The usual statement of this condition assumes that trade  is initially balanced  We will present a generalization of the condition that allows for an initial  trade imbalance and hence is more useful in addressing whether exchange rate movements will  correct such imbalances 
6,502,Recall from microeconomics that the price elasticity of demand is given by   
7,502,     
8,502,  change
9,502,in quantity
10,502,  change
11,502,in price
12,502,   
13,502,  Q
14,502,  P
15,502,For example a demand elasticity of     means that quantity demanded increases by   percent if  price declines by    percent  Note that the elasticity of demand is defined so that it is a positive  number  Because expenditure  R  equals price multiplied by quantity  P   Q  by re arranging  the above expression to solve and substitute for   Q we can see that 
16,502,  change
17,502,in expenditure     R     P     Q             P
18,502,From this we can see that an increase in price decreases expenditure if       but it increases  expenditure if        By convention if       demand is described as being  elastic  while if        demand is described as  inelastic

2,503,The basic idea behind the Marshall Lerner condition is that demand for imports and exports  must be sufficiently price sensitive so that increasing the relative price of imports increases the  difference between export receipts and import expenditures  The generalized Marshall Lerner  condition is 
3,503, X X    M  M         
4,503,where  X and  M are the shares of exports and imports respectively in total trade  i e  imports    exports  and  X and  M are the price elasticities of foreign demand for domestic country  exports and domestic country demand for imports respectively  Note that   X    M      and  that an initial trade deficit implies  M    X  If this condition is satisfied a  devaluation depreciation of the domestic currency will move the trade balance toward surplus 
5,503,The first term in the generalized Marshall Lerner condition reflects the change in export  receipts assuming the domestic currency price of exports is unchanged  i e  foreigners are  billed in the domestic currency   It will be positive as long as export demand is not totally  insensitive to price  Depreciation of the domestic currency makes exports cheaper in foreign  currency and induces an increase in the quantity demanded by foreigners  This is reflected by  the elasticity  x  There is no direct price impact on domestic currency export revenue because  the domestic currency price is assumed to be unchanged  Hence the percentage change in  export revenue corresponding to a   percent depreciation of the currency is simply  x  The  second term in the generalized Marshall Lerner condition reflects the impact on import  expenditures  Assuming that imports are billed in a foreign currency the domestic currency  price of imports rises as the domestic currency depreciates  The direct price effect increases  import expenditures while the induced reduction in the quantity of imports decreases import  expenditures  The net effect depends on the elasticity of import demand  M  Import expenditure  declines only if import demand is elastic  i e   M      
6,503,Examination of the generalized Marshall Lerner condition indicates that more elastic  demand for either imports or exports makes it more likely that the trade balance will  improve  Indeed if the demand for imports is elastic  M     then the trade balance will  definitely improve  It should also be clear that the elasticity of import demand becomes  increasingly important and the export elasticity less important as the initial trade deficit gets  larger that is as  M increases  In the special case of initially balanced trade  X    M the  condition reduces to   X    M      which is the classic Marshall Lerner condition 
7,503,Exhibit   illustrates the impact of depreciation on the trade balance  For ease of reference we  assume the domestic currency is the euro  A    percent depreciation of the euro makes imports     percent more expensive in euro terms  With an import elasticity of      this induces a      percent reduction in the quantity of imports  But import expenditures increase by     percent                     or           because the drop in quantity is not sufficient to offset the  increase in price  On the export side the euro price of exports does not change but the foreign  currency price of exports declines by    percent  This induces a     percent increase in the  quantity of exports given an elasticity of       The euro value of exports therefore increases by      percent or            The net effect is a          improvement in the trade balance and  a           increase in total trade

9,504,The balance of trade improves after the depreciation of the euro because the Marshall Lerner  condition is satisfied  The increase in the euro value of exports exceeds the increase in the value  of imports  Based on the data in Exhibit    M        i e                        and  X         i e            Thus the Marshall Lerner equation is greater than zero

11,504,The elasticity of demand for any good or service depends on at least four factors     the  existence or absence of close substitutes    the structure of the market for that product  e g  a  monopoly or perfect competition     its share in people s budgets and    the nature of the  product and its role in the economy  Demand for a product with close substitutes is highly  price sensitive whereas demand for a unique product tends to be much less elastic  The demand  curve faced by any producer also depends on the nature and level of competition among  producers of that product  If there are many sellers of identical products then each producer  faces highly elastic demand for its output even if global demand for that product is insensitive  to price  Producers who are able to differentiate their product perhaps through branding face  somewhat less elastic demand  In markets with only a few sellers each producer faces demand  that is highly dependent upon strategic maneuvers by its competitors  If competitors match price  decreases but not increases then the producer loses market share by raising his price but fails to  gain market share by reducing his price 
12,504,Price changes have two effects on demand  The substitution effect refers to changes in the  composition of spending across different products  As a product gets more expensive  cheaper   relative to other products customers demand less  more  of it  This is what people usually think  of first when they consider the effect of a price change  The income effect refers to the fact that  price changes affect real purchasing power  When the price of a good rises  falls  people s  purchasing power is reduced  increased   The strength of this effect depends on the product s  share in people s budgets the more important the product the stronger the income effect  The  income effect also depends on the nature of the product  The demand for luxuries is highly  sensitive to income whereas the demand for necessities is fairly insensitive to income

2,505,To illustrate the differential impact of the two drivers of the income effect share of  expenditure and nature of the product consider the demand for food  Clearly food is a  necessity  Based on this fact we would expect demand to be inelastic  However the share of  expenditures that go to food varies across countries  In poor countries food represents a much  larger share of expenditure than in rich countries  Hence all else being equal we would expect  the demand for food to be more price elastic in poorer countries  Of course even in rich  countries the composition of spending on food may change considerably even if overall  demand for food does not 
3,505,A significant portion of international trade occurs in intermediate products products that are  used as inputs into the production of other goods  Demand for these products derives from  supply and demand decisions for the final products  However the same basic considerations  apply for intermediate products as for final products  Are there close substitutes for it in the  production process  If not its demand will tend to be less elastic than would be the case if there  were readily available substitutes  How important is it to the overall economy  All else equal  the larger its share in overall production costs for the economy the bigger its impact on  production decisions and therefore the more price elastic its derived demand  Oil is a classic  example of a widely used input with few readily adoptable substitutes at least in the short run   Lack of substitutes tends to make oil demand price inelastic  However it is so important in  modern industrial economies that changes in its price can induce expansion or contraction of  aggregate output  This makes short run oil demand somewhat more elastic at least for  significant price changes  In the longer run the feasibility of substitution among energy sources  enhances the price sensitivity of oil demand

10,506,In practice most countries import and export a variety of products  Hence the overall price  elasticities of their imports and exports reflect a composite of the products they trade  In  conjunction with the Marshall Lerner condition our review of the factors that determine price  elasticities suggests that exchange rate changes will be a more effective mechanism for trade  balance adjustment if a country imports and exports the following 
11,506,  Goods for which there are good substitutes
12,506,  Goods that trade in competitive markets
13,506,  Luxury goods rather than necessities

2,507,Exhibit     Trade Balance Dynamics  The J Curve
3,507,In the very short run the J curve reflects the order delivery lags that take place in import and  export transactions  Imagine a clothing importer in Washington  Orders are placed in January  for French spring fashions  Market forces cause the dollar to depreciate in February but  contracts were already signed for payment in euros  When the fashions arrive in March more  dollars have to go out to pay for the order signed in euros  Thus the trade balance gets worse   However after the depreciation the clothing importer has to put in new orders for summer  fashions  As a result of the currency depreciation the French summer fashions are now more  expensive so the clothing store cuts the demand for imported clothes from France  The  depreciation eventually improves the trade balance even though it initially made it worse 
4,507,A J curve pattern may also arise if short term price elasticities do not satisfy the Marshall  Lerner condition but long term elasticities do satisfy it  As noted above in the case of oil  significant changes in spending patterns often take time  Thus the trade balance may worsen  initially and then gradually improve following a depreciation of the currency as firms and  consumers adapt 
5,507,     Exchange Rates and the Trade Balance  The Absorption  Approach
6,507,The elasticities approach focuses on the expenditure switching effect of changing the relative  prices of imports and exports  It is essentially a microeconomic view of the relationship  between exchange rates and the trade balance  The absorption approach adopts an explicitly  macroeconomic view of this relationship

2,508,Recall from above that the trade balance is equal to the country s saving including the  government fiscal balance minus its investment in new plants and equipment  Equivalently it  is equal to the difference between income  GDP  and domestic expenditure or absorption   Thus in order to move the trade balance toward surplus a devaluation depreciation of the  domestic currency must increase income relative to expenditure or equivalently increase  national saving relative to investment in physical capital 
3,508,If there is excess capacity in the economy then by switching demand toward domestically  produced goods and services depreciation of the currency can increase output income  Because  some of the additional income will be saved income rises relative to expenditure and the trade  balance improves  If the economy is at full employment however the trade balance cannot  improve unless domestic expenditure declines  If expenditure does not decline then the  depreciation will put upward pressure on domestic prices until the stimulative effect of the  exchange rate change is negated by the higher price level and the trade balance reverts to its  original level 
4,508,How might depreciation of the currency reduce domestic expenditure relative to income  The  main mechanism is a wealth effect  A weaker currency reduces the purchasing power of  domestic currency denominated assets  including the present value of current and future earned  income   Households respond by reducing expenditure and increasing saving in order to rebuild  their wealth  Of course as real wealth is rebuilt the effect on saving is likely to be  reversed resulting in only a temporary improvement in the trade balance  Thus in the absence  of excess capacity in the economy currency depreciation is likely to provide only a temporary  solution for a chronic trade imbalance  Lasting correction of the imbalance requires more  fundamental changes in expenditure saving behavior  e g  a policy shift that improves the fiscal  balance or an increase in saving relative to capital investment induced by an increase in real  interest rates  
5,508,The absorption approach also reminds us that currency depreciation cannot improve the trade  balance unless it also induces a corresponding change in the capital account  Not only must  domestic saving increase but that saving must also be willingly channeled into buying financial  assets from foreigners  All else equal this implies that foreign and domestic asset prices must  change such that foreign assets become relatively more attractive and domestic assets relatively  less attractive to both foreign and domestic investors 
6,508,EXAMPLE  
7,508,Exchange Rates and the Trade Balance
8,508,An analyst at a foreign exchange dealing bank is examining the exchange rate for the  Australian dollar  AUD  which is a freely floating currency  Currently Australia is  running a trade surplus with the rest of the world primarily reflecting strong demand for  Australian resource exports generated by rapid growth in emerging market economies in  the Western Pacific region  In turn Australia imports food and energy from a variety of  foreign countries that compete with each other as well as with Australian producers of  these products  The analyst uses data in the following table to estimate the effect of  changes in the AUD exchange rate on Australia s balance of trade

2,509,Volume   AUD billions  Demand Elasticity        
3,509,Imports
4,509,The analyst s research report on this topic notes that the mix of products that Australia  imports and exports seems to be changing and that this will affect the relation between  the exchange rates and the trade surplus  The proportion of Australian exports accounted  for by fine wines is increasing  These are considered a luxury good and must compete  with increased wine exports from comparable producing regions  such as Chile and  New Zealand   At the same time rising income levels in Australia are allowing the  country to increase the proportion of its imports accounted for by luxury goods and  these represent a rising proportion of consumer expenditures  The analyst s report states    Given the changing export mix an appreciation of the currency will be more likely to  reduce Australia s trade surplus  In contrast the changing import mix will have the  opposite effect  
5,509,   Given the data in the table an appreciation in the AUD will 
6,509,A  cause the trade balance to increase 
7,509,B  cause the trade balance to decrease 
8,509,C  have no effect on the trade balance 
9,509,   All else equal an appreciation in the AUD will be more likely to reduce the trade  surplus if the demand 
10,509,A  elasticities for imports and exports increase 
11,509,B  elasticity for exports and the export share in total trade decrease 
12,509,C  elasticity for imports decreases and the import share in total trade increases 
13,509,   All else equal an appreciation in the AUD will be more likely to reduce the trade  surplus if it leads to an increase in Australian

2,510,A  The trade surplus would increase 
3,510,B  The trade balance would go to zero 
4,510,C  The trade balance would not necessarily be affected 
5,510,   Suppose the Australian government imposed capital controls that prohibited the  flow of financial capital into or out of the country  The impact on the trade  balance if any would most likely take the form of 
6,510,A  a decrease in private saving 
7,510,B  a decrease in private investment 
8,510,C  an increase in the government fiscal balance 
9,510,Solution to   
10,510,A is correct  As the AUD appreciates the price of exports to offshore buyers goes up  and they demand fewer of them  hence the AUD denominated revenue from exports  decreases   Although export demand is inelastic or  X     recall that the Australian price of these exports is assumed not to have changed so the amount of export revenue  received by Australia in AUD terms unambiguously declines as the quantity of exports  declines   Australian expenditure for imports also declines  Although the price of  imports declines as the AUD appreciates the Australians do not increase their import  purchases enough to lead to higher expenditures  This is because import demand is also  inelastic   M       This effect on import expenditure can be seen from    RM          M   PM where   PM is negative  import prices are declining  and import demand is  inelastic  so       M        With both import expenditures and export revenues declining  the net effect on the trade balance comes down to the relative size of the import and  export weights   M and  X respectively   In this case  X         i e           and  M          i e            Putting this into the Marshall Lerner equation leads to 
11,510, X X    M  M                                          
12,510,Because the Marshall Lerner condition is not satisfied exchange rate movements do not  move the trade balance in the expected direction  i e  appreciation  depreciation  of the  currency does not decrease  increase  the trade balance   However note that with  different import export weights and the same elasticities the Marshall Lerner condition  would be met  In particular the condition would be met for any value of  X greater than                
13,510,Solution to   
14,510,A is correct  The basic intuition of the Marshall Lerner condition is that in order for an  exchange rate movement to rebalance trade the demands for imports and exports must  be sufficiently price sensitive  i e  they must have sufficiently high elasticities    However the relative share of imports and exports in total trade must also be  considered  The generalized Marshall Lerner condition requires

2,511,An increase in both  X and  M will clearly make this expression increase  A is correct    In contrast a decrease in both  X and  X tends to make the expression smaller  B is  incorrect     If  M decreases and  M increases import demand will respond less to an  exchange rate movement and will have a larger role in determining the trade balance  C  is incorrect  
3,511,Solution to   
4,511,B is correct  An Australian trade surplus means that Australia is spending less than it  earns and is accumulating claims on foreigners  Equivalently Australian saving  inclusive of both private saving and the government fiscal balance is more than  sufficient to fund Australian private sector investment  The relationship between the  trade balance and expenditure saving decisions is given by 
5,511,X   M    S   I     T   G     
6,511,For Australia s trade balance to decline it must save less  S down  invest more  I up   decrease its fiscal balance  T   G down  or some combination of these  Increasing tax  receipts  T up  increases rather than decreases the fiscal balance so answer A is  incorrect  Similarly answer C increasing the government budget surplus is incorrect   Increasing private investment  I up  does decrease the trade balance so answer B is  correct 
7,511,Solution to   
8,511,B is correct  As Australian exports become more dominated by luxury goods that face  highly competitive market conditions the elasticity of export demand   X  is likely to be  increasing  Increasing export elasticity makes the trade surplus more responsive to an  AUD appreciation  the increase in  X will tend to increase the computed value for the  Marshall Lerner equation   Similarly as Australian imports become more dominated by  luxury goods that are an increasing proportion of household expenditure import  elasticity   M  will most likely increase  This will also tend to increase the computed  value for the Marshall Lerner equation 
9,511,Solution to   
10,511,B is correct  A trade deficit  surplus  must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital  account surplus  deficit   Anything that impacts the trade balance must impact the  capital account and vice versa  If capital flows are prohibited then both the capital  account and the trade balance must be zero 
11,511,Solution to   
12,511,A is correct  The trade balance must go to zero  An increase in the fiscal balance implies  an increase in the existing trade surplus so answer C is incorrect  A decrease in private  investment will also cause an increase in the trade surplus so answer B is incorrect  A  decrease in private saving will decrease the trade surplus as required so answer A is  correct  A decrease in saving will most likely reflect a decline in national income  especially the profit component as export demand is choked off by the inability to  extend credit to foreigners

2,512,SUMMARY
3,512,Foreign exchange markets are crucial for understanding both the functioning of the global  economy as well as the performance of investment portfolios  In this reading we have  described the diverse array of FX market participants and have introduced some of the basic  concepts necessary to understand the structure and functions of these markets  The reader  should be able to understand how exchange rates both spot and forward are quoted and be  able to calculate cross exchange rates and forward rates  We also have described the array of  exchange rate regimes that characterize foreign exchange markets globally and how these  regimes determine the flexibility of exchange rates and hence the degree of foreign exchange  rate risk that international investments are exposed to  Finally we have discussed how  movements in exchange rates affect international trade flows  imports and exports  and capital  flows 
4,512,The following points among others are made in this reading 
5,512,  Measured by average daily turnover the foreign exchange market is by far the largest  financial market in the world  It has important effects either directly or indirectly on the  pricing and flows in all other financial markets 
6,512,  There is a wide diversity of global FX market participants that have a wide variety of  motives for entering into foreign exchange transactions 
7,512,  Individual currencies are usually referred to by standardized three character codes  These  currency codes can also be used to define exchange rates  the price of one currency in  terms of another   There are a variety of exchange rate quoting conventions commonly  used 
8,512,  A direct currency quote takes the domestic currency as the price currency and the foreign  currency as the base currency  i e  Sd f   An indirect quote uses the domestic currency as  the base currency  i e  Sf d   To convert between direct and indirect quotes the inverse   reciprocal  is used  Professional FX markets use standardized conventions for how the  exchange rate for specific currency pairs will be quoted 
9,512,  Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets based on nominal exchange rates  An  increase  decrease  in the exchange rate quoted in indirect terms means that the domestic  currency is appreciating  depreciating  versus the foreign currency 
10,512,  The real exchange rate defined as the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of  price levels measures the relative purchasing power of the currencies  An increase in the  real exchange rate  Rd f  implies a reduction in the relative purchasing power of the  domestic currency 
11,512,  Given exchange rates for two currency pairs A B and A C we can compute the cross  rate  B C  between currencies B and C  Depending on how the rates are quoted this may  require inversion of one of the quoted rates

2,513,  Spot exchange rates are for immediate settlement  typically T      while forward  exchange rates are for settlement at agreed upon future dates  Forward rates can be used  to manage foreign exchange risk exposures or can be combined with spot transactions to  create FX swaps 
3,513,  The spot exchange rate the forward exchange rate and the domestic and foreign interest  rates must jointly satisfy an arbitrage relationship that equates the investment return on  two alternative but equivalent investments  Given the spot exchange rate and the foreign  and domestic interest rates the forward exchange rate must take the value that prevents  riskless arbitrage 
4,513,  Forward rates are typically quoted in terms of forward  or swap  points  The swap points  are added to the spot exchange rate in order to calculate the forward rate  Occasionally  forward rates are presented in terms of percentages relative to the spot rate 
5,513,  The base currency is said to be trading at a forward premium if the forward rate is above  the spot rate  forward points are positive   Conversely the base currency is said to be  trading at a forward discount if the forward rate is below the spot rate  forward points are  negative  
6,513,  The currency with the higher  lower  interest rate will trade at a forward discount   premium  
7,513,  Swap points are proportional to the spot exchange rate and to the interest rate differential  and approximately proportional to the term of the forward contract 
8,513,  Empirical studies suggest that forward exchange rates may be unbiased predictors of  future spot rates but the margin of error on such forecasts is too large for them to be used  in practice as a guide to managing exchange rate exposures  FX markets are too complex  and too intertwined with other global financial markets to be adequately characterized by  a single variable such as the interest rate differential 
9,513,  Virtually every exchange rate is managed to some degree by central banks  The policy  framework that each central bank adopts is called an exchange rate regime  These  regimes range from using another country s currency  dollarization  to letting the market  determine the exchange rate  independent float   In practice most regimes fall in between  these extremes  The type of exchange rate regime used varies widely among countries  and over time 
10,513,  An ideal currency regime would have three properties      the exchange rate between any  two currencies would be credibly fixed      all currencies would be fully convertible  and      each country would be able to undertake fully independent monetary policy in pursuit  of domestic objectives such as growth and inflation targets  However these conditions  are inconsistent  In particular a fixed exchange rate and unfettered capital flows severely  limit a country s ability to undertake independent monetary policy  Hence there cannot  be an ideal currency regime 
11,513,  The IMF identifies the following types of regimes  arrangements with no separate legal  tender  dollarization monetary union  currency board fixed parity target zone crawling  peg crawling band managed float and independent float  Most major currencies traded  in FX markets are freely floating albeit subject to occasional central bank intervention

2,514,  A trade surplus  deficit  must be matched by a corresponding deficit  surplus  in the  capital account  Any factor that affects the trade balance must have an equal and opposite  impact on the capital account and vice versa 
3,514,  A trade surplus reflects an excess of domestic saving  including the government fiscal  balance  over investment spending  A trade deficit indicates that the country invests more  than it saves and must finance the excess by borrowing from foreigners or selling assets  to foreigners 
4,514,  The impact of the exchange rate on trade and capital flows can be analyzed from two  perspectives  The elasticities approach focuses on the effect of changing the relative price  of domestic and foreign goods  This approach highlights changes in the composition of  spending  The absorption approach focuses on the impact of exchange rates on aggregate  expenditure saving decisions 
5,514,  The elasticities approach leads to the Marshall Lerner condition which describes  combinations of export and import demand elasticities such that depreciation   appreciation  of the domestic currency will move the trade balance toward surplus   deficit  
6,514,  The idea underlying the Marshall Lerner condition is that demand for imports and  exports must be sufficiently price sensitive so that an increase in the relative price of  imports increases the difference between export receipts and import expenditures 
7,514,  In order to move the trade balance toward surplus  deficit  a change in the exchange rate  must decrease  increase  domestic expenditure  also called absorption  relative to income   Equivalently it must increase  decrease  domestic saving relative to domestic investment 
8,514,  If there is excess capacity in the economy then currency depreciation can increase  output income by switching demand toward domestically produced goods and services   Because some of the additional income will be saved income rises relative to expenditure  and the trade balance improves 
9,514,  If the economy is at full employment then currency depreciation must reduce domestic  expenditure in order to improve the trade balance  The main mechanism is a wealth  effect  A weaker currency reduces the purchasing power of domestic currency  denominated assets  including the present value of current and future earned income  and  households respond by reducing expenditure and increasing saving

2,519,C  Global capital flows must shift toward the domestic market 
3,519,SOLUTIONS
4,519,   B is correct  The exchange rate is the number of units of the price currency that   unit of  the base currency will buy  Equivalently it is the number of units of the price currency  required to buy   unit of the base currency 
5,519,   B is correct  The real exchange rate  quoted in terms of domestic currency per unit of  foreign currency  is given by 
6,519,Real exchange rate d f    Sd f    Pf Pd 
7,519,An increase in the domestic price level  Pd  decreases the real exchange rate because it  implies an increase in the relative purchasing power of the domestic currency 
8,519,   B is correct  The receivable is due in     days  To reduce the risk of currency exposure  the British company would initiate a forward contract to sell euros buy pounds at an  exchange rate agreed to today  The agreed upon rate is called the forward exchange rate 
9,519,   C is correct  The sell side generally consists of large banks that sell foreign exchange and  related instruments to buy side clients  These banks act as market makers quoting  exchange rates at which they will buy  the bid price  or sell  the offer price  the base  currency 
10,519,   B is correct  In the case of a direct exchange rate the domestic currency is the price  currency  the numerator  and the foreign currency is the base currency  the denominator    If the domestic currency appreciates then fewer units of the domestic currency are  required to buy   unit of the foreign currency and the exchange rate  domestic per  foreign  declines  For example if sterling  GBP  appreciates against the euro  EUR  then  euro sterling  GBP EUR  might decline from        to        
11,519,   A is correct  An indirect quote takes the foreign country as the price currency and the  domestic country as the base currency  To get CHF which is the executive s domestic  currency as the base currency the quote must be stated as EUR CHF  Using the hotel  manager s information the indirect exchange rate is                     
12,519,   C is correct  The appreciation of sterling against the Swiss franc is simply the inverse of  the     depreciation of the Swiss franc against Sterling                                              or        
13,519,   B is correct  The percentage appreciation of the base currency can be calculated by  dividing the appreciated exchange rate by the initial exchange rate  In this case the  unknown is the initial exchange rate  The initial exchange is the value of X that satisfies  the formula 
14,519,       X       
15,519,Solving for X leads to

2,520,   A is correct  To get to the ZAR HKD cross rate it is necessary to take the inverse of the  CNY ZAR spot rate and then multiply by the CNY HKD exchange rate 
3,520,ZAR HKD    CNY ZAR       CNY HKD                                
4,520,    C is correct  The ZAR SEK cross rate from the original dealer is                           which is lower than the quote from the second dealer  To earn an arbitrage profit  a currency trader would buy SEK  sell ZAR  from the original dealer and sell SEK  buy  ZAR  to the second dealer  On   million SEK the profit would be
5,520,SEK                               ZAR     
6,520,    B is correct  The number of forward points equals the forward rate minus the spot rate or                             multiplied by                              points  By  convention forward points are scaled so that    forward point corresponds to a change of     in the last decimal place of the spot exchange rate 
7,520,    A is correct  Given the forward rate and forward points as a percentage the unknown in  the calculation is the spot rate  The calculation is as follows 
8,520,Spot rate        Forward points as a percentage    Forward rate
9,520,Spot rate                       
10,520,Spot                       
11,520,    B is correct  The base currency trading at a forward discount means that   unit of the base  currency costs less for forward delivery than for spot delivery  i e  the forward exchange  rate is less than the spot exchange rate  The forward points expressed either as an  absolute number of points or as a percentage are negative 
12,520,    C is correct  To eliminate arbitrage opportunities the spot exchange rate  S  the forward  exchange rate  F  the interest rate in the base currency  ib  and the interest rate in the  price currency  ip  must satisfy

2,521,    C is correct  An ideal currency regime would have credibly fixed exchange rates among  all currencies  This would eliminate currency related uncertainty with respect to the  prices of goods and services as well as real and financial assets 
3,521,    C is correct  Fixed exchange rates impose severe limitations on the exercise of  independent monetary policy  With a rigidly fixed exchange rate domestic interest rates  monetary aggregates  e g  money supply  and credit conditions are dictated by the  requirement to buy sell the currency at the rigid parity  Even a narrow band around the  parity level allows the monetary authority to exercise some discretionary control over  these conditions  In general the wider the band the more independent control the  monetary authority can exercise 
4,521,    B is correct  With a currency board the monetary authority is legally required to  exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate  It  cannot issue domestic currency without receiving foreign currency in exchange and it  must hold that foreign currency as a      reserve against the domestic currency issued   Thus the country s monetary base  bank reserves plus notes and coins in circulation  is  fully backed by foreign exchange reserves 
5,521,    A is correct  A trade deficit must be exactly matched by an offsetting capital account  surplus to fund the deficit  A capital account surplus reflects borrowing from foreigners   an increase in domestic liabilities  and or selling assets to foreigners  a decrease in  domestic assets   A capital account surplus is often referred to as a  capital inflow   because the net effect is foreign investment in the domestic economy 
6,521,    A is correct  A devaluation of the domestic currency means domestic producers are  cutting the price faced by their foreign customers  The impact on their unit sales and their  revenue depends on the elasticity of demand  Expensive luxury goods exhibit high price  elasticity  Hence luxury car producers are likely to experience a sharp increase in sales  and revenue due to the devaluation 
7,521,    C is correct  The trade surplus cannot decline unless the capital account deficit also  declines  Regardless of the mix of assets bought and sold foreigners must buy more  assets from  or sell fewer assets to  domestic issuers investors 
8,521,NOTES
9,521, This convention is consistent with the meaning of     in mathematics and the straightforward interpretation of   A B  as  A per B  is helpful in understanding exchange rates as the price of one currency in terms of another   Nevertheless other notation conventions exist   B A  and  B A  are sometimes used to denote what this reading  denotes as  A B   Careful attention to the context will usually make the convention clear 
10,521, Note that an  FX swap  is not the same as a  currency swap   An FX swap is simply the combination of a spot  and a forward FX transaction  i e  only two settlement dates spot and forward are involved   A currency swap  is generally used for multiple periods and payments 
11,521, See International Monetary Fund        
12,521, In general however there is a hierarchy for quoting conventions  For quotes involving the EUR it serves as the  base currency  e g  GBP EUR   Next in the priority sequence for quotes involving the GBP  but not the EUR  it  serves as the base currency  e g  USD GBP   Finally for quotes involving the USD  but not the GBP or EUR  it  serves as the base currency  e g  CAD USD   Exceptions among the major currencies are the AUD and NZD  they  serve as the base currency when quoted against the USD  i e  USD AUD USD NZD

2,522, As mentioned earlier  maturity  is defined in terms of the time between spot settlement  usually T      and the  settlement of the forward contract 
3,522, Because the JPY USD exchange rate is only quoted to two decimal places forward points for the dollar yen  currency pair are divided by     
4,522, It is because of this arbitrage relationship that the all in financing rate using swap financing is close to the  domestic interest rate 
5,522, Recall that this equation is based on an f d exchange rate quoting convention  If the exchange rate data were  presented in d f form one could either invert these quotes back to f d form and use the above equation or use the  following equivalent equation       id       Sd f      if Fd f  If this latter equation were used remember that forward  and spot exchange rates are now being quoted on a d f convention 
6,522, This means that for interest calculation purposes it is assumed that there are     days in the year  However the  actual number of days the funds are on deposit is used to calculate the interest payable 
7,522,  Economists refer to the unit of account in terms of which other goods services and assets are priced as the  numeraire  Under the classical gold standard the official value of each currency was expressed in ounces of gold 
8,522,  The European inflation of the   th century was an important exception  Discoveries of gold in South America  led to an increase in the world gold stock and in prices throughout Europe  The impact was especially pronounced  in Imperial Spain the primary importing country  Historians have attributed the decline of the Spanish Empire in  part to the loss of control of domestic prices

10,522,  Whether or not FX markets satisfy recognized definitions of market efficiency correctly reflecting all available  information is debatable  e g  some point to evidence of trending as a clear violation of efficiency   However  there is no doubt that FX market participants attempt to incorporate new information which is often lumpy and  difficult to decipher into their expectations about the future  Changing expectations accurate or  otherwise affect the value that investors place on holding different currencies and in a highly liquid market lead  to rapid and sometimes violent exchange rate movements 
11,522,  The number of European countries adopting the euro has continued to expand since its inception  the most  recent country to join the euro was Lithuania on   January      
12,522,  The classifications are described in International Monetary Fund         In some cases the labels used by the  IMF do not clearly distinguish among the regimes  Hence the names applied here to the regimes differ somewhat  from the IMF s original taxonomy

16,522,  In official balance of payments accounts investment financing flows are separated into two categories  the  capital account and the financial account  Because the technical distinction is immaterial for present purposes we  will simply refer to the balance of investment financing flows as the capital account  Similarly we ignore the  technical distinction between the trade balance and the current account balance  The details of balance of payments  accounting are presented in the Level I curriculum reading on International Trade and Capital Flows
