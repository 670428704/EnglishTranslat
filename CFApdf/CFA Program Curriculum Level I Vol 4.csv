5,13,INTRODUCTION
6,13,Weak corporate governance is a common thread found in many company failures   A  lack of proper oversight by the board of directors  inadequate protection for minority  shareholders  and incentives at companies that promote excessive risk taking are  just a few of the examples that can be problematic for a company  Poor corporate  governance practices resulted in several high  profile accounting scandals and corpo  rate bankruptcies over the past several decades and have been cited as significantly  contributing to the           global financial crisis   In response to these company failures  regulations have been introduced to  promote stronger governance practices and protect financial markets and investors    Academics  policy makers  and other groups have published numerous works dis  cussing the benefits of good corporate governance and identifying core corporate  governance principles believed to be essential to ensuring sound capital markets and  the stability of the financial system  The investment community has also demonstrated a greater appreciation for the  importance of good corporate governance  The assessment of a company  s corporate  governance system including consideration of conflicts of interest and transparency  of operations  has increasingly become an essential factor in the investment decision   making process   Additionally investors have become more attentive to environment  and social issues related to a company  s operations   Collectively these areas often are  referred to as environmental social and governance  ESG   Section   of this reading provides an overview of corporate governance including  its underlying principles and theories   Section   discusses the various stakeholders of  a company and conflicts of interest that exist among stakeholder groups   Section    describes stakeholder management  reflecting how companies manage their relation  ships with stakeholders   Section   focuses on the role of the board of directors and its  committees as overseers of the company  Section   explores certain key factors that  affect corporate governance  Section   highlights the risks and benefits that underlie  a corporate governance structure  Section   provides an overview of corporate gov  ernance issues relevant for investment professionals   Finally Section   discusses the  growing effect of environmental and social considerations in the investment process  
7,13,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
8,13,Corporate governance can be defined as  the system of internal controls and proce  dures by which individual companies are managed  It provides a framework that defines  the rights  roles and responsibilities of various groups       within an organization  At  its core corporate governance is the arrangement of checks  balances  and incentives  a company needs in order to minimize and manage the conflicting interests between  insiders and external shareowners     Corporate governance practices differ among countries and jurisdictions  and even  within countries different corporate governance systems may co  exist   The corporate  governance systems adopted in most of the world typically reflect the influences of  either shareholder theory or stakeholder theory to a varying extent as well as historical  cultural legal political and other influences specific to a region

2,14, 
3,14,Shareholder theory takes the view that the most important responsibility of a  company  s managers is to maximize shareholder returns   Stakeholder theory broad  ens a company  s focus beyond the interests of only its shareholders to its customers   suppliers  employees  and others who have an interest in the company  The approach  to corporate governance in a given country typically places greater emphasis on one  of the two theories but can also exhibit a combination of the two  Notwithstanding the  system of corporate governance used nearly all companies depend on contributions  from a number of stakeholders for their long  term success   The company  s strategy  is set by the board of directors  which also oversees management   in turn the com  pany  s strategy is executed by its managers   financial capital to fund the company  s  activities and operations is supplied by shareholders  creditors  and suppliers   human  capital is provided by employees   and demand for goods and services comes from  customers   Other stakeholders include governments and regulators  which seek to  protect the interests and well  being of their citizens   Certain external forces  such as  the legal environment and competition affect the way a company operates and the  relationships among its stakeholders   Two reports issued during the     s  the Cadbury Report and the Principles of  Corporate Governance were particularly influential in shaping the global corporate  governance landscape  In      the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate  Governance was established in the United Kingdom by the Financial Reporting  Council the London Stock Exchange and the accountancy profession to examine  corporate governance  In the following year the report of the committee commonly  referred to as the Cadbury Report  after its chairman defined corporate governance  simply as  the system by which companies are directed and controlled   The report  focused on the responsibilities of a company  s board of directors  shareholders  and  auditors  with shareholders implicitly identified as the primary stakeholder  In       the Organisation for Economic Co  operation and Development  OECD  produced  the Principles of Corporate Governance which expanded the scope of corporate  governance to consider the interests of other stakeholders notably employees  cred  itors  and suppliers   According to the OECD  Corporate governance includes a set  of relationships between a company  s management  its board its shareholders  and  other stakeholders    The Principles of Corporate Governance which was revised in       and again in      also discusses potential positive outcomes of good corporate  governance practices  including financial market stability and economic growth  and  includes standards and guidelines designed to evaluate and improve the corporate  governance framework throughout the world  There is evidence that some movement toward global convergence of corporate  governance systems is underway  One trend is the increased acceptance and adoption  of corporate governance regulations with similar principles from one jurisdiction  to another  For example a number of countries implemented regulations similar to  those of the US Sarbanes Oxley Act of       SOX  in response to corporate and  accounting scandals of the early     s   Although these regulations are not identical  they share the same objective of improving internal controls and restoring investor  confidence in financial disclosures   Another trend is initiatives by international agen   cies to build greater consensus on important corporate governance principles   The  Principles of Corporate Governance for example has been ratified by more than     member countries  representing a broad range of corporate governance models   The  Principles of Corporate Governance do not mandate or even promote the adoption  of a single corporate governance regime  rather the principles were designed to serve  as a framework that can be adopted by any number of corporate governance systems

5,15,Corporate Governance Overview
6,15,Which statement regarding corporate governance is most accurate  A Most countries have similar corporate governance regulations   B A single definition of corporate governance is widely accepted in practice  C Both shareholder theory and stakeholder theory consider the needs of a  company  s shareholders  
7,15,Solution 
8,15,C is correct   Both shareholder and stakeholder theories consider the needs of  shareholders  with the latter extending to a broader group of stakeholders   A  is incorrect because corporate governance regulations differ across countries   although there is a trend toward convergence  B is incorrect because a universally  accepted definition of corporate governance remains elusive 
9,15,COMPANY STAKEHOLDERS
10,15,A corporate governance system is likely to be influenced by several stakeholder groups    These groups do not necessarily share similar goals or needs  in fact the interests of any  one group may conflict with the interests of another group  The varying influences of  these groups are important considerations for investment professionals when analyzing  a corporate governance system  This section provides an overview of a corporation s  primary stakeholder groups  followed by a discussion of principal agent considerations  and the conflicts that may arise among the groups  
11,15,    Stakeholder Groups
12,15,The primary stakeholder groups of a corporation consist of shareholders  creditors   managers  or executives  other employees  board of directors  customers  suppliers   and governments regulators  and by extension affected individuals and community  groups   The interests of each of these groups are discussed in the following sections  
13,15,      Shareholders
14,15,Shareholders own shares of stock in a corporation and are entitled to certain rights   such as the right to receive dividends and to vote on certain corporate issues    In terms  of capital structure shareholders are the most junior class of capital providers   in  case of a company bankruptcy shareholders receive proceeds only after all creditors   claims are paid  Shareholder interests are therefore typically focused on growth in  corporate profitability that maximizes the value of a company  s equity  As a company grows in size and its operations and structure become more com  plex  most individual shareholders have little involvement in the company  s activities    Shareholders maintain control over the company through their power to elect the board  of directors and vote for specified resolutions   The board of directors is expected to  represent shareholders protecting their interests  appointing senior management   providing strategic direction and monitoring company and management performance 
15,15,  https    themoderncorporation wordpress  com company  law  memo 
1,16,Company Stakeholders
2,16, 
3,16,In publicly traded companies that have dispersed ownership the voting power in  general meetings is distributed among a large number of shareholders   But in some  companies  a particular shareholder or block of shareholders may hold a percentage  of shares that gives them sufficient voting power to control the election of the board  of directors and to influence the approval or blockage of a company resolution  these  shareholders are known as controlling shareholders  In contrast  non  controlling  shareholders  minority shareholders  hold a much smaller proportion of a company  s  outstanding shares  resulting in a more limited ability to exercise control in voting  activities  
4,16,      Creditors
5,16,Creditors  most commonly bondholders and banks  are a company  s lenders and the  providers of debt financing   Creditors do not hold voting power  unlike common  shareholders  and typically have limited influence over a company  s operations    Creditors may protect themselves and exert some control over a company by using  covenants  which restrict activities of the borrower  In return for capital provided  creditors expect to receive interest and principal payments   These payments are  pre  determined from the terms of a debt contract and are typically not contingent  on the company  s performance  Creditors usually do not participate in a company  s  superior performance beyond receiving promised interest and principal payments    The company  s ability to generate cash flows  mainly through its operations  is the  primary source of payments for creditors   Consequently creditors generally prefer  stability in company operations and performance which contrasts with the interests  of shareholders  who generally are inclined to tolerate higher risks in return for higher  return potential from strong company performance 
6,16,      Managers and Employees
7,16,Senior executives and other high  level managers are normally compensated through  salary bonuses  equity  based remuneration  or compensation   and certain perqui  sites   As a result  managers may be motivated to maximize the value of their total  remuneration while also protecting their employment positions   Lower  level employ  ees normally seek fair remuneration good working conditions  access to promotions   career development opportunities  training and development  job security and a safe  and healthy work environment   As with shareholders and creditors  managers and employees have a significant  interest in the company  s viability  Managers and employees tend to benefit if the  company performs well and are among the most adversely affected stakeholders if  a company  s financial position weakens   Despite some similarities  the interests of  managers and employees and other stakeholders can conflict  For example a company  may be presented with a takeover offer that is attractive to shareholders but would  jeopardize the interests of managers in preserving their employment at the company 
8,16,      Board of Directors
9,16,A company  s board of directors is elected by shareholders to protect shareholders   interests  provide strategic direction and monitor company and management perfor  mance  A board is typically structured as either one  tier or two  tier  A one  tier structure consists of a single board of directors  composed of executive  and non  executive directors   Executive  sometimes called  internal   directors are  employees  typically senior managers  of the company  Non  executive  sometimes
10,16,  The terms  remuneration  and  compensation  are typically interchangeable with compensation generally  used in North America and remuneration generally used outside North America   In this reading  unless  specifically identified with North America  we primarily use  remuneration

3,17,called  external   directors are not employees of the company  Countries in which one   tier boards are common include the United States  the United Kingdom and India    A two  tier structure consists of two separate boards       a supervisory board which  is primarily composed of non  executive directors  and     a management  executive   board which is composed of executive directors   The supervisory board oversees the  management board  Two  tier boards are common in such countries as Germany the  Netherlands  Finland and China   In this reading  unless specified otherwise the term  board  refers to the single  board of directors in a one  tier structure and the supervisory board in a two  tier struc  ture  Directors  both internal and external are typically experienced individuals who  are focused on fulfilling their responsibilities toward shareholders and the company  while maintaining a good reputation in the business community  Directors are also  typically concerned with their exposure to liability for breach of duty  Directors can  mitigate this exposure by exercising appropriate levels of control over the company  s  operations and its management   A company  s board of directors is discussed in more  detail in Section   of this reading  
4,17,      Customers
5,17,Customers expect a company  s products or services to satisfy their needs and provide  appropriate benefits given the price paid as well as to meet applicable standards of  safety  Depending on the type of product or service and the duration of their relation  ship with the company customers may desire ongoing support  product guarantees   and after  sale service  Companies are concerned with customer satisfaction given its  potential correlation with sales revenues and profit  Compared with other stakeholder  groups  customers tend to be less concerned with and affected by a company  s finan  cial performance  However customers  particularly those with long  term relationships  with the company typically have an interest in a company  s stability 
6,17,      Suppliers
7,17,A company  s suppliers have a primary interest in being paid as contracted or agreed  on and in a timely manner for products or services delivered to the company   Suppliers often seek to build long  term relationships with companies for the benefit  of both parties and aim for these relationships to be fair and transparent   Suppliers   like creditors  are concerned with a company  s ability to generate sufficient cash flows  to meet its financial obligations  
8,17,      Governments Regulators
9,17,Governments and regulators seek to protect the interests of the general public and  ensure the well  being of their nations  economies   Because corporations have a sig  nificant effect on a nation s economic output  capital flows  employment  and social  welfare among other factors  regulators have an interest in ensuring that corporations  behave in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws   As the collector of tax rev  enues  a government can also be considered one of the company  s major stakeholders  
10,17,Stakeholders in Non  profit Organizations
11,17,The stakeholders of a non  profit organization tend to differ from those of for  profit  companies  Non  profit organizations do not have shareholders  Their stakeholders most  commonly include board directors or trustees employees regulators society patrons of

6,18,Which stakeholders would most likely realize the greatest benefit from a signif  icant increase in the market value of the company  A Creditors B Customers C Shareholders
7,18,Solution 
8,18,C is correct   Shareholders own shares of stock in the company and their wealth  is directly related to the market value of the company  A is incorrect because  creditors are usually not entitled to any additional cash flows  beyond interest  and debt repayment  if the company  s value increases   B is incorrect because  customers may have an interest in the company  s stability and long  term viability  but they do not benefit directly from an increase in a company  s value 
9,18,    Principal Agent and Other Relationships in Corporate  Governance
10,18,A principal agent relationship  also known as an agency relationship  is created  when a principal hires an agent to perform a particular task or service  The principal  agent relationship involves obligations  trust  and expectations of loyalty   the agent  is expected to act in the best interests of the principal  In a company agency theory  stipulates that principal agent relationships often lead to conflicts for example when  managers do not act in the best interests of shareholders    Examples of principal agent  relationships and potential conflicts between the principal and agent are discussed in  the following sections   Conflicts among stakeholder groups are also discussed but do  not involve principal agent relationships  
11,18,      Shareholder and Manager Director Relationships
12,18,In shareholder  owned companies  shareholders typically grant directors and man  agers the responsibility to make most corporate decisions   According to traditional  shareholder theory discussed earlier the central duty of directors and managers is  to act in the best interests of shareholders   In certain circumstances  managers may  seek to maximize their personal benefits  e g   remuneration and perquisites  to the  detriment of shareholders  interests  
13,18,  Agency theory considers the problems that can arise in a business relationship when one person delegates  decision  making authority to another  The traditional view in the investment community is that directors  and managers are agents of shareholders   More recently however many legal experts have argued that in  several countries  corporations are separate  legal persons  and thus directors and managers are agents of  the corporations rather than shareholders  or a subset of shareholders   See https    themoderncorporation  wordpress  com company  law  memo

2,19,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,19,Shareholder and manager  or shareholder and director  interests can also diverge  with respect to risk tolerance  In some cases  shareholders with diversified investment  portfolios may have a relatively high risk tolerance because the risk undertaken by a  specific company can be diversified across the shareholders  investments   Managers  and directors  however are typically more risk averse in their corporate decision  making so they can better protect their employment status   Such behavior may differ  from the company  s value creation objective  In addition compared with sharehold  ers  managers typically have greater access to information about the business and  are more knowledgeable about its operations   Such  information asymmetry    that  is  unequal access to information  makes it easier for managers to make strategic  decisions that are not necessarily in the best interest of shareholders and weakens  the ability of shareholders to exercise control  Another conflict of interest might arise  between shareholders and directors when the board is influenced by insiders   In this  case the ability of the board to properly perform its monitoring and control role may  be hindered  Finally a conflict between the two groups may occur if directors favor  certain influential shareholders over other shareholders  
4,19,      Controlling and Minority Shareholder Relationships
5,19,In companies in which a particular shareholder holds a controlling stake conflicts  of interest may arise among the controlling and minority shareholders   In such  ownership structures  the opinions of minority shareholders are often outweighed  or overshadowed by the influence of the controlling shareholders   Minority share  holders often have limited or no control over management and limited or no voice  in director appointments or in major transactions that could have a direct effect on  the value of their shares   For instance in companies that adopt straight voting  that  is  one vote for each share owned  controlling shareholders clearly wield the most  influence in board of director elections  leaving minority shareholders with much less  representation on the board  The decisions made by controlling shareholders  or their board representatives   could also have an effect on corporate performance and consequently on minority  shareholders  wealth  Takeover transactions are notable situations in which controlling  shareholders typically have greater influence than do minority shareholders with  regard to the consideration received and other deal terms   An example of this situation  occurred in      when Qtel Qatar  s largest telecommunications company executed a  deal with a consortium of the shareholders of Wataniya  Kuwait s telecommunications  company to acquire the consortium s shares in Wataniya  representing a     stake  in the target   The consortium of Wataniya s shareholders sold their shares to Qtel  at a premium of     on the stock price to the exclusion of minority shareholders   Related  party transactions are another example for which controlling shareholders  may place their interests ahead of minority shareholders  interests   Such a situation  could occur when a controlling shareholder maintains a financial interest in a trans  action between the company and a third party and that transaction conflicts with  the company  s best interests   Consider for example a controlling shareholder that  arranges a deal between the company and a third  party supplier that is owned by the  shareholder  s spouse whereby the supplier provides the company with inventory at  above market prices   Such a transaction would benefit the controlling shareholder  and the spouse s interests but could harm the profitability of the company and the  interests of minority shareholders   Lastly an equity structure with multiple share classes in which one class is non   voting or has limited voting rights creates a divergence between the ownership and  control rights of different classes of shareholders   Under a multiple  class structure   traditionally called a dual  class structure when there are two share classes  the com  pany  s founders  executives  and other key insiders control the company by virtue of  ownership of a share class with superior voting powers   The multiple  class structure

3,20,enables controlling shareholders to mitigate dilution of their voting power when new  shares are issued  Examples of companies that have adopted multiple  class stock  structures are Alibaba and Facebook  each with two share classes  as well as Comcast  and Google  each with three share classes  
4,20,      Manager and Board Relationships
5,20,Given that a board of directors typically relies on management to operate the company  the board s monitoring role can be compromised in the event of limited information  provided to the board  This conflict is particularly pronounced for non  executive  directors who are typically not involved in the day  to  day operations of a company 
6,20,      Shareholder versus Creditor Interests
7,20,Shareholders typically seek growth in corporate profitability because of the residual  nature of equity returns   However the pre  determined returns of debt obligations  normally prevent creditors from receiving any cash flows beyond principal and interest  payments  but do expose creditors to default risk in case of extremely poor corporate  performance  From an investment perspective shareholders would likely prefer riskier  projects with a strong likelihood of higher return potential whereas creditors would  likely prefer stable performance and lower  risk activities   A divergence in risk tolerance  regarding the company  s investments thus exists between shareholders and creditors   Creditors may also find their interests jeopardized when the company attempts  to increase its borrowings to a level that would increase default risk   If the company  s  operations and investments fail to generate sufficient returns required to repay the  increased interest and debt obligations  creditors will be increasingly exposed to default  risk   The distribution of excessive dividends to shareholders might also conflict with  creditors  interests if it impairs the company  s ability to pay interest and principal 
8,20,      Other Stakeholder Conflicts
9,20,In a corporation interests can also conflict among other stakeholders   Some of these  situations are as follows      Conflict between customers and shareholders  For example a company decides  to charge a high price for its products or reduces product safety features to  reduce costs      Conflict between customers and suppliers  A company offers overly lenient  credit terms to its customers  whereby the company  s ability to repay suppliers  on time may be affected     Conflict between shareholders and governments or regulators  Examples of such  conflicts may include a company adopting accounting and reporting practices  that reduce its tax burden thus potentially benefiting shareholders  or a bank s  shareholders preferring a lower equity capital base while regulators prefer  a higher capital position  This last conflict is fairly common in the banking  industry and has been increasingly in focus since the global financial crisis of            
10,20,EXAMPLE  
11,20,Stakeholder Relationships
12,20,A controlling shareholder of XYZ Company owns     of XYZ s shares  and  the remaining shares are spread among a large group of shareholders   In this  situation conflicts of interest are most likely to arise between  A  shareholders and regulators

6,21,Solution 
7,21,C is correct   In this ownership structure the controlling shareholder  s power is  likely more influential than that of minority shareholders   Thus  the controlling  shareholder may be able to exploit its position to the detriment of the interests  of the remaining shareholders   Choices A and B are incorrect because the own  ership structure in and of itself is unlikely to create material conflicts between  shareholders and regulators or shareholders and managers  
8,21,STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
9,21,Because interests among stakeholder groups differ companies often adopt mechanisms  to more efficiently manage stakeholder relationships   Stakeholder management  involves identif ying  prioritizing  and understanding the interests of stakeholder  groups  and on that basis  managing the company  s relationships with these groups  
10,21,    Overview of Stakeholder Management
11,21,Effective communication and active engagement with the various stakeholders form  the basis of stakeholder management   Although the practices underlying stakeholder  management may vary companies typically seek to balance the interests of their  various stakeholders and thus limit the effect of conflicts   To help balance these interests  corporate governance and stakeholder manage  ment frameworks reflect a legal contractual organizational and governmental infra  structure that defines the rights  responsibilities  and powers of each group  The legal  infrastructure defines the framework for rights established by law and the availability  or ease of legal recourse for any violation of these rights   The contractual infrastruc  ture is shaped by the contractual arrangements entered into by the company and its  stakeholders that help define and secure the rights of both parties   The organizational  infrastructure refers to internal systems  governance procedures  and practices adopted  and controlled by the company in managing its stakeholder relationships   Lastly the  governmental infrastructure refers to regulations imposed on companies   The corporate governance systems in such countries as France Germany and  Japan focus on a broader range of stakeholders relative to the more shareholder  driven  Anglo  American systems   Globally there is a growing movement among regulators  and practitioners to more effectively balance the interests of all stakeholders   For  instance the Companies Act      in the United Kingdom introduced  enlightened  shareholder value  which requires directors to consider the interests of all stakehold  ers not just shareholders   Several regulators  such as those in the United Kingdom  and Japan have adopted stewardship codes that encourage more active engagement  of institutional investors with companies

5,22,The component of stakeholder management in which a corporation has the  most control is   A  legal infrastructure  B contractual infrastructure  C governmental infrastructure 
6,22,Solution 
7,22,B is correct   A corporation s contractual infrastructure refers to the contractual  arrangements between the corporation and stakeholders   As such the corpo  ration has control over these arrangements   A is incorrect because the legal  infrastructure is established by law which is outside the corporation s own  control  Similarly C is incorrect because a corporation s governmental structure  is largely imposed by regulators  
8,22,    Mechanisms of Stakeholder Management
9,22,Stakeholder management and governance practices attempt to manage the interests  of all stakeholders   As mentioned earlier a prescribed or standard set of rights and  practices does not exist across all companies  and the principles vary across countries  and jurisdictions   Still there are some common control elements and governance  mechanisms among companies  
10,22,      General Meetings
11,22,Corporate laws grant shareholders certain powers and controls   The participation of  shareholders in general meetings  also known as general assemblies  and the exercise  of their voting rights are among the most influential tools available  General meet  ings enable shareholders to participate in discussions and to vote on major corporate  matters and transactions that are not delegated to the board of directors   Companies are ordinarily required to hold an annual general meeting  AGM   within a certain period following the end of their fiscal year  The main purpose of those  meetings is to present shareholders with the annual audited financial statements of  the company provide an overview of the company  s performance and activities  and  address shareholder questions   Shareholders also elect the directors at the AGM and  in some countries  may be required to approve the financial statements  discharge  directors of their duties  appoint external auditors  or vote on the remuneration of  the board and or top management   Extraordinary general meetings can be called by  the company or by shareholders throughout the year when significant resolutions  requiring shareholder approval are proposed  These resolutions might relate to pro  posed material corporate changes  such as amendments to the company  s bylaws or  rights attached to a class of shares  mergers and acquisitions  or the sale of significant  corporate assets or businesses   All shareholders typically have the right to attend speak at  and vote at general  meetings   Regulations  particularly corporate laws  specify conditions for inviting  shareholders to general meetings and circulating information to shareholders   These  conditions vary across regulations but generally aim at ensuring the participation  of a large number of shareholders in general meetings without imposing excessive  restrictions on the ability of the company to hold a meeting   By engaging in general  meetings  shareholders can exercise their voting rights on major corporate issues

2,23,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,23,and better monitor the performance of the board and senior management   General  meetings and the underlying voting procedures are among the most widely adopted  practices by companies in mitigating agency problems and their associated risks   Some resolutions  such as the approval of financial statements and the election  of directors and auditors  are considered ordinary at general meetings because they  require only a simple majority of votes to be passed  Decisions that are more material  in nature may require a supermajority vote such as two  thirds or     of votes  to  be passed  Such special resolutions may include amendments to bylaws  voting on  a merger or takeover transaction or waiving pre  emptive rights   Depending on the  ownership structure supermajority requirements may make it harder for majority  shareholders to influence corporate decisions at the expense of minority shareholders   Proxy voting is a process that enables shareholders who are unable to attend a  meeting to authorize another individual  for example another shareholder or director   to vote on their behalf  Proxy voting is the most common form of investor participa  tion in general meetings   Although most resolutions at most companies pass without  controversy sometimes minority shareholders attempt to strengthen their influence at  companies via proxy voting   Several shareholders sometimes use this process to collec  tively vote their shares in favor of or in opposition to a certain resolution  Cumulative  voting  as opposed to straight voting  enables each shareholder to accumulate and  vote all his or her shares for a single candidate in an election involving more than  one director  This voting process raises the likelihood that minority shareholders are  represented by at least one director on the board but it may not be compatible with  majority voting standards for director elections in which share ownership is widely  dispersed  In terms of worldwide practice the existence of cumulative voting varies    for example it is mandated in Spain but not allowed in several countries  such as  Germany Japan Singapore and Turkey  Minority shareholders are often granted rights to protect their interests in acqui  sitions   For example companies in European Union member states are required to  adopt sell  out rights   These rights allow minority shareholders who have voted against  a merger offer to force a bidder with more than     of the target s voting rights to  buy their shares at a fair price upon the deal s approval

7,23,Solution 
8,23,C is correct   An amendment to corporate bylaws would normally take place  during an EGM which covers significant changes to a company such as bylaw  amendments   A and B are incorrect because the appointment of external audi  tors and a corporate performance overview would typically take place during  the AGM

3,24,      Board of Director Mechanisms
4,24,In companies with complex ownership structures and operations  it is impractical  for shareholders to be involved in strategy formulation and day  to  day activities    Shareholders thus elect a board of directors to provide broad oversight of the company   Shareholders monitor the board s performance through exercise of voting power and  participation in general meetings   The board in turn appoints the top management of  the company  The board is accountable primarily to shareholders and is responsible for  the proper governance of the company   in this regard the board is the link between  shareholders and managers   The board guides managers on the company  s strategic  direction oversees and monitors management s actions in implementing the strategy  and evaluates and rewards or disciplines management performance  The board also  supervises the company  s audit  control and risk management functions and ensures  the adoption of proper governance systems and compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations   In Section   of this reading  we provide more detail regarding the  functions and responsibilities of the board of directors and its committees  
5,24,      The Audit Function
6,24,The audit function is an integral component of any governance structure  The func  tion represents the systems  controls  and policies procedures in place to examine  the company  s operations and financial records   Internal audits are conducted by an  independent internal audit function or department  External auditors are independent  from the company and conduct an annual audit of the company  s financial records to  provide reasonable and independent assurance of the accuracy of financial statements  and their fair representation of the financial position of the company  External audi  tors are typically recommended by an audit committee  which we discuss later in the  reading  for appointment by shareholders or in some jurisdictions  by the board  The  board of directors is generally required to receive and review the financial statements  and auditors  reports and confirm their accuracy before they are presented to share  holders for approval at the AGM  Senior management of publicly traded companies  is also required to review and provide assurance of the effectiveness of the internal  control systems to the board of directors or to shareholders   Overall a company  s audit  function limits insiders  discretion with regard to the use of company resources and  to its financial reporting   The audit function is also designed to mitigate incidents of  fraud or misstatements of accounting and financial information 
7,24,      Reporting and Transparency
8,24,Shareholders have access to a range of financial and non  financial information con  cerning the company typically through annual reports  proxy statements  disclosures  on the company  s website the investor relations department  and other means of  communication  e g   social media   This information may relate to the company  s  operations  its strategic direction or objectives  audited financial statements  governance  structure ownership structure remuneration policies  related  party transactions  and  risk factors   Such information is essential for shareholders to    reduce the extent of information asymmetry between shareholders and  managers      assess the performance of the company and of its directors and managers      make informed decisions in valuing the company and deciding to purchase sell  or transfer shares   and    vote on key corporate matters or changes

3,25,      Policies on Related  Party Transactions
4,25,The development and implementation of policies for related  party transactions and  other conflicts of interest is an increasingly common practice among companies   These  policies establish the procedures for mitigating  managing  and disclosing such cases    Typically directors and managers are required to disclose any actual or potential  or direct or indirect  conflict of interest they have with the company as well as any  material interests in a transaction that may affect the company  Often these policies  require such transactions or matters to be voted on by the board  or shareholders   excluding the director  or shareholder  holding the interest   The adoption of these  policies and procedures aims at ensuring that related  party transactions are handled  fairly and that they do not advance the interests of the related party at the expense of  the interests of the company or other shareholders  
5,25,      Remuneration Policies
6,25,Executive remuneration plans have gained significant attention in the investment world  with a primary goal of aligning the interests of managers with those of shareholders    For this purpose incentive plans increasingly include a variable component typically  profit sharing  stocks  or stock options that is contingent on corporate or stock price  performance  However the granting of stock  based remuneration does not serve its  purpose if managers can improve their personal gains at the expense of the company  while limiting their exposure to weak stock performance  As a result  companies  are increasingly designing incentive plans that discourage either  short  termism   or excessive risk taking by managers   Some incentive plans include granting shares   rather than options  to managers and restricting their vesting or sale for several years  or until retirement   A long  term incentive plan delays the payment of remuneration  either partially or in total until company strategic objectives  typically performance  targets  are met   Regulators across the world are also increasingly focused on remuneration policies    In some cases  regulators require companies to base remuneration specifically on  long  term performance measures   A number of regulators are requiring companies   including many in the financial industry to adopt clawback provisions   These pro  visions allow a company to recover previously paid remuneration if certain events   such as financial restatements  misconduct  breach of the law or risk management  deficiencies  are uncovered 
7,25,      Say on Pay
8,25,Given the role of remuneration plans in aligning the interests of executives with those  of shareholders  regulators and companies are increasingly seeking shareholder views  on pay  The concept of say on pay enables shareholders to vote on executive remu  neration matters   Say on pay was first introduced in the United Kingdom in the early      s   As one early example in      the shareholders of GlaxoSmithKline rejected  the company  s remuneration report because of opposition to the proposed executive  pay  This was the first such rejection by the shareholders of a large UK  based com  pany  Shortly thereafter the practice of say on pay spread to other parts of the world  and was implemented in the United States as part of the Dodd Frank Act in       The scope and effect of say on pay varies across countries and companies   Some  countries  such as Canada  have a non  mandatory and advisory  non  binding  say on  pay system in which shareholders signal rather than impose their views on proposed  remuneration  In other countries  such as the United States  France and South Africa   say on pay is mandatory but non  binding   In these countries  the board is required to  enable shareholders to vote on remuneration plans or packages  but the board does not  have to abide by the result of the vote  Conversely countries in which shareholder votes  on say on pay are binding include the Netherlands  the United Kingdom and China  
1,26,Stakeholder Management
2,26,  
3,26,Say on pay has been subject to criticism because of the fact that shareholders often  have limited involvement in a company  s strategy and operations   These opponents  argue that the board is better suited to determine remuneration matters   Conversely  by allowing shareholders to express their views on remuneration  related matters   companies can limit the discretion of directors and managers in granting themselves  excessive or inadequate remuneration  This approach could thus reduce a critical  agency conflict in stakeholder management by better aligning the interests of prin  cipals and agents  
4,26,      Contractual Agreements with Creditors
5,26,The rights of creditors are established by laws and according to contracts executed with  the company  Laws vary by jurisdiction but commonly contain provisions to protect  creditors  interests and provide legal recourse  One such provision is an indenture  which is a legal contract that describes the structure of a bond the obligations of the  issuer and the rights of the bondholders   To limit creditors  risk during the term of  a bond  or loan  debtholders may choose to impose covenants within indentures or  contracts   Covenants are the terms and conditions of lending agreements  enabling  creditors to specify the actions an issuer is obligated to perform or prohibited from  performing   Collaterals are another tool often used by creditors to guarantee repay  ment representing assets or financial guarantees that are above and beyond an issuer  s  promise to repay its obligations   To further protect their rights  creditors usually require the company to provide  periodic information  including financial statements  to ensure that covenants are not  violated and thus potential default risk is not increased  Because it is usually imprac  tical and costly for individual bondholders to fully scrutinize a bond issue companies  often hire a financial institution to act as a trustee and monitor the issue on behalf of a  class of bondholders   In some countries  credit committees  particularly for unsecured  bondholders  are established once a company files for bankruptcy  Such committees  are expected to represent bondholders throughout the bankruptcy proceedings and  protect bondholder interests in any restructuring or liquidation 
6,26,      Employee Laws and Contracts
7,26,Employee rights are primarily secured through labor laws  which define the standards  for employees  rights and responsibilities and cover such matters as labor hours   pension and retirement plans  hiring and firing  and vacation and leave  In most  countries  employees have the right to create unions   Unions seek to influence certain  matters affecting employees   In the European Union companies meeting specific size  and geographic criteria are required to establish European Works Councils that are  composed of employees who meet with management at least annually  Although not  a common practice in the United States and many other parts of the world employ  ees are sometimes represented on the board of directors or supervisory boards of  companies meeting certain size or ownership criteria  e g   in Germany Austria  and  Luxembourg   In Japan the employee model stresses reaching a consensus between  management and employees in decision making   At the individual level employment contracts specify an employee s various rights  and responsibilities   Employment contracts typically do not cover every situation  between employees and employers  and thus there is some area of discretion in the  employment relationship  Human resources policies also help companies manage their  relationships with employees   Effective human resources policies seek to attract and  recruit high  quality employees while providing remuneration training development   and career growth to improve employee retention  Some companies have employee  stock ownership plans  ESOPs  to help retain and motivate employees   As part of an  ESOP a company establishes a fund consisting of cash and or company shares   The  shares  which have designated vesting periods  are granted to employees  
1,27,  
2,27,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,27,Codes of ethics and business conduct also serve an important role in the relationship  between employees and the company  Such codes establish the company  s values and  the standards of ethical and legal behavior that employees must follow  Companies  typically assign a compliance or corporate governance officer  or a board committee   to implement these codes  receive violation reports  and resolve ethical matters   By managing its relationships with its employees  a company seeks to comply with  employees  rights and mitigate legal or reputational risks in violation of these rights    Employee relationship management also helps ensure that employees are fulfilling  their responsibilities toward the company and are qualified and motivated to act in  the company  s best interests  
4,27,       Contractual Agreements with Customers and Suppliers
5,27,Both customers and suppliers enter into contractual agreements with a company that  specify the products and services underlying the relationship the prices or fees and  the payment terms  the rights and responsibilities of each party the after  sale rela  tionship and any guarantees   Contracts also specify actions to be taken and recourse  available if either party breaches the terms of the contract  
6,27,       Laws and Regulations
7,27,As part of their public service roles  governments and regulatory authorities develop  laws that companies must follow and monitor companies  compliance with these laws    Such laws may address or protect the rights of a specific group such as consumers or  the environment   Some industries or sectors whose services  products  or operations  are more likely to endanger the public or specific stakeholders  interests are usually  subject to a more rigorous regulatory framework   Examples of these industries are  banks  food manufacturers  and health care companies   Many regulatory authorities have also adopted corporate governance codes that  consist of guiding principles for publicly traded companies   Publicly traded com  panies  in turn are generally required to annually publish corporate governance  reports describing their governance structure and explain any deviations from guiding  principles   Companies normally seek to adopt internal governance and compliance  procedures and adhere to the relevant financial reporting and transparency require  ments imposed by regulators

3,28, 
4,28,BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES
5,28,As discussed earlier in the reading  the board of directors is a central component of a  company  s governance structure  The board serves as the link between shareholders  and managers and acts as the shareholders  monitoring tool within the company  As  the relevance of corporate governance has grown within the investment field the  responsibilities of the board of directors have also increased in importance 
6,28,    Composition of the Board of Directors
7,28,The structure and composition of a board of directors vary by company and geogra  phy  There is no single or optimal structure and the number of directors may differ  depending on the company size structure and complexity of operations   Most cor  porate governance codes require that the board include a diverse mix of expertise  backgrounds  and competencies   Such qualifications may include specialized knowledge  of the company  s industry as well as experience in certain functions  such as strategy  finance audit risk management human resources  or legal  Moreover many companies  seek age gender and racial diversity in board composition  Boards with one  tier structures comprise a mix of executive and non  executive  directors   Executive  or internal  directors are employed by the company and are typ  ically members of senior management   Non  executive  or external  directors provide  objective decision making  monitoring  and performance assessment   Additionally  non  executive directors can serve an important role in challenging management and  using past expertise in strategy and board issues   An independent director is a specific  type of non  executive director that does not have a material relationship with the  company with regard to employment  ownership or remuneration  In two  tier structures  the supervisory and management boards are independent  from each other  Regulators generally prohibit members of the management board from  serving on the supervisory board or limit the number of individuals serving on both  boards   Employee representatives are typically elected by the company  s employees  and could make up half of the supervisory board in large companies   In many countries  the chief executive officer  CEO  and chairperson roles are  increasingly separated  In the United States  many companies have historically had   CEO duality  in which the CEO also serves as chairperson of the board  Nevertheless   the percentage of companies separating the two roles  particularly in the United States   has increased considerably in recent years   The appointment of a lead independent  director is an alternative that is sometimes practiced by boards of companies without  CEO duality  The lead independent director generally has the authority to request  and oversee meetings of all independent directors   Duality is not applicable in two   tier structures that prohibit the members of the management board from serving on  the supervisory board  In these models  the chairperson of the supervisory board is  typically external and the CEO usually chairs the management board 
8,28,Staggered Boards
9,28,The general practice for boards is that elections occur simultaneously and for specified  terms  three years for example   Some companies however have staggered boards  whereby directors are typically divided into three classes that are elected separately  in consecutive years that is one class every year  Because shareholders would need  several years to replace a full board this election process limits their ability to effect a

5,29,As mentioned earlier a company  s board of directors is elected by shareholders to act  on their behalf  In fulfilling their functions  directors have a responsibility to consider  the interests of all stakeholders   The duties of directors are mandated by law in many  countries but vary across jurisdictions   Two widely established elements of directors   responsibilities are the duty of care and the duty of loyalty  According to the OECD s  Principles of Corporate Governance duty of care  requires board members to act on  a fully informed basis  in good faith with due diligence and care   The OECD further  notes that duty of loyalty  is the duty of the board member to act in the interest of  the company and shareholders   The duty of loyalty should prevent individual board  members from acting in their own interest  or the interest of another individual or  group at the expense of the company and all shareholders    A board of directors does not typically engage in the company  s day  to  day activities   rather those activities are delegated to management   The board guides and approves  the company  s strategic direction taking into consideration the company  s risk profile   It delegates the implementation of the company  s strategy to senior management   oversees the execution of the strategy and establishes milestones to monitor the  progress in reaching the objectives   The board also reviews corporate performance  and determines relevant courses of action accordingly  In doing so the board can  monitor and evaluate management s performance and determine whether senior  executive remuneration is aligned with the long  term interests of the company  The  board is also responsible for selecting  appointing  and terminating the employment  of senior managers  or the management board in case of a two  tier structure   One of  the board s main responsibilities is to ensure leadership continuity though succession  planning for the CEO and other key executives   The board plays a central role in ensuring the effectiveness of the company  s audit  and control systems   It sets the overall structure of these systems and oversees their  implementation including oversight of the financial reporting practices and the review  of the financial statements for fairness and accuracy  The board also oversees reports  by internal audit  the audit committee and the external auditors and proposes and  follows up on remedial actions   The board has the ultimate responsibility to ensure  that the company adopts and implements proper corporate governance principles  and complies with all applicable internal and external laws and regulations  including  ethical standards   In addition the board typically ensures that the company has an appropriate  enterprise risk management system in place whereby risks are identified mitigated  assessed and managed appropriately  The board monitors the effectiveness of these  systems through regular reviews and reports received from both management and  the company  s risk function  The board also has the responsibility to review any  proposals for corporate transactions or changes  such as major capital acquisitions   divestures  mergers  and acquisitions  before they are referred to shareholders for  approval if applicable 
6,29,    Board of Directors Committees
7,29,A company  s board of directors typically establishes committees that focus on specific  functions   Such committees  in turn provide recommendations that are reported to  the board on a regular basis   Despite the delegation of responsibilities to committees 
1,30,Board of Directors and Committees
2,30,  
3,30,the overall board remains ultimately responsible to shareholders and is not discharged  of its liabilities to shareholders   Although board committees may vary by organiza  tion some of the most common committees are discussed in the following sections  
4,30,      Audit Committee
5,30,The audit committee is perhaps the most common board committee among companies  worldwide  The audit committee plays a key role in overseeing the audit and control  systems at the company and ensuring their effectiveness   In this regard the commit  tee monitors the financial reporting process  including the application of accounting  policies   ensures the integrity of financial statements   supervises the internal audit  function and ensures its independence and competence  and presents an annual audit  plan to the board and monitors its implementation by the internal audit function   The audit committee is also responsible for recommending the appointment of an  independent external auditor and proposing the auditor  s remuneration  Both inter  nal and external auditors report their findings to the audit committee which in turn  proposes remedial action for highlighted issues or matters  
6,30,      Governance Committee
7,30,The primary role of the governance  or corporate governance  committee is to ensure  that the company adopts good corporate governance practices   In doing so the  committee develops and oversees the implementation of the corporate governance  code the charters of the board and its committees  and the company  s code of ethics  and conflict of interest policy  The governance committee reviews these policies on  a regular basis to incorporate any regulatory requirements or relevant developments  in the field  Most importantly the committee monitors the implementation of the  governance policies and standards as well as the compliance with the applicable laws  and regulations throughout the company  Remedial actions are recommended if any  flaws or breaches of laws or regulations are identified  In some companies  the gover  nance committee may be responsible for overseeing an annual evaluation of the board  to ensure that its structure and activities are aligned with the governance principles  
8,30,      Remuneration or Compensation Committee
9,30,The remuneration  or compensation  committee of the board specializes in remu  neration matters   This committee develops and proposes remuneration policies for  the directors and key executives and presents them for approval by the board or  by shareholders   The committee may also be involved in handling the contracts of  managers and directors as well as in setting performance criteria and evaluating the  performance of managers   The responsibilities of the remuneration committee may  extend to establishing human resources policies for the company when remuneration  matters are involved  In some companies  the remuneration committee also sets and  oversees the implementation of employee benefit plans  including insurance pension  severance benefits  and retirement plans  including monitoring investment perfor  mance of benefit plan funds  
10,30,      Nomination Committee
11,30,The nomination committee identifies candidates who are qualified to serve as directors  and recommends their nomination for election by shareholders   The committee also  establishes the nomination procedures and policies  including the criteria for board  directors  the search process  and the identification of qualified candidates for director  positions   Director independence including what constitutes an independent director  is also a function of the nomination committee  Through these roles  the nomination  committee can help ensure that the board s composition is well balanced and aligned  with the company  s governance principles

3,31,      Risk Committee
4,31,The risk committee assists the board in determining the risk policy profile and  appetite of the company  Accordingly the committee oversees establishing enterprise  risk management plans and monitors their implementation  It also supervises the risk  management functions in the company receives regular reports  and reports on its  findings and recommendations to the board 
5,31,      Investment Committee
6,31,The investment committee of the board reviews material investment opportuni  ties proposed by management and considers their viability for the company  Such  opportunities may include large projects  acquisitions  and expansion plans  as well  as divestures or major asset disposals   The committee often challenges  when nec  essary management assumptions underlying investment prospects  monitors the  performance of investments  and reports its findings to the board  The committee  also is typically responsible for establishing and revising the investment strategy and  policies of the company  The specific board committees discussed in previous sections are the most com  monly used although the composition and number of committees may vary depending  on the jurisdiction or on company  specific factors  e g   company size industry com  plexity of operations  or regulatory requirements   An audit committee for instance  is a regulatory requirement in a large number of jurisdictions   For banks and other  financial institutions  a risk committee is strongly recommended by some regulators  and required by others   In Brazil the Central Bank of Brazil requires financial insti  tutions to establish a remuneration committee at the board level  Some companies  choose to combine two or more committees into one for example a nomination and  remuneration  or compensation  committee or an audit and risk committee  Companies  may also find it valuable to establish committees with other specializations  such as  a compliance committee an ethics committee a human resources committee or a  health environmental safety committee  The composition of a board committee is normally aligned with its scope of respon  sibilities   For instance many regulators request that executive  internal  directors do  not rule on matters underlying conflicts of interest or on matters requiring an unbiased  judgment  such as audit remuneration or related  party transaction matters   As such  a large number of rules  including those adopted by the London Stock Exchange and  the New York Stock Exchange require that the audit and the compensation commit  tees be composed of independent directors only  Less stringent regulations  such as  those of the Gulf Cooperation Council require the audit committee to be composed  of external  non  executive  directors  the majority of which should be independent   including the chairperson

8,31,Responsibilities of Board Committees
9,31,A primary responsibility of a board s audit committee does not include the  A proper application of accounting policies   B adoption of proper corporate governance  C  recommendation of remuneration for the external auditor s  
1,32,Factors Affecting Stakeholder Relationships and Corporate Governance
2,32,  
3,32,Solution 
4,32,B is correct   The adoption of proper corporate governance is the responsibility  of a corporation s governance committee  Both A and C are incorrect because  proper application of accounting policies and the remuneration of external  auditors fall under the domain of the audit committee 
5,32,FACTORS AFFECTING STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS  AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
6,32, 
7,32,This section explores ways in which certain factors  both market and non  market  related can affect stakeholder relationships and corporate governance  For this sec  tion market factors include those that relate to capital markets whereas non  market  factors do not  
8,32,    Market Factors
9,32,This section focuses on shareholder engagement shareholder activism and competitive  forces  all of which are influential market factors for a company  Shareholder engage  ment involves a company  s interactions with its shareholders  whereas shareholder  activism describes the efforts by shareholders to create a change within a corporation  or modify a corporation s behavior  Meanwhile competitive dynamics can help align  managerial interests with those of its stakeholders  
10,32,      Shareholder Engagement
11,32,The engagement of companies with shareholders called shareholder engagement  has traditionally involved certain events  such as the annual shareholder meeting  and analyst calls  the scope of which was limited to financial and strategic matters    There is a growing trend however for greater engagement between companies and  their shareholders beyond these venues and topics   Companies have increasingly  recognized the benefits that frequent  year  round engagement with shareholders can  provide such as building support against short  term activist investors  countering  negative recommendations from proxy advisory firms  and receiving greater support  for management s position 
12,32,      Shareholder Activism
13,32,Shareholder activism refers to strategies used by shareholders to attempt to compel  a company to act in a desired manner  Although shareholder activism can focus on  a range of issues  including those involving social or political considerations  the  primary motivation of activist shareholders is to increase shareholder value  Activist  shareholders often pressure management through such tactics as initiating proxy  battles  fights  proposing shareholder resolutions  and publicly raising awareness on  issues of contention  Shareholder activists may pursue additional tactics  such as shareholder derivative  lawsuits  which are legal proceedings initiated by one or more shareholders against  board directors  management  and or controlling shareholders of the company   The theory behind this type of lawsuit is that the plaintiff shareholder is deemed to  be acting on behalf of the company in place of its directors and officers who have  failed to adequately act for the benefit of the company and its shareholders   In many  countries  however the law restricts shareholders from pursuing legal action via the
1,33,  
2,33,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,33,court system in some cases  by imposing thresholds that enable only shareholders  with interests above a minimum amount to pursue legal actions or by denying legal  action altogether  Hedge funds are among the most predominant shareholder activists   Compared  with most traditional institutional investors  the fee structure of hedge funds often pro  vides a significant stake in the financial success of any activist campaign  Furthermore  unlike regulated investment entities that are typically subject to restrictions on  their investments  e g   limitations on leverage or ownership of distressed or illiquid  securities  hedge funds are loosely regulated and can thus pursue a greater range of  activist opportunities  
4,33,      Competition and Takeovers
5,33,Metrics that measure a company  s success  such as market share or earnings growth  provide information that is useful for shareholders to judge the performance of a  company  s management team or board of directors and compare such performance  with that of competitors   Senior managers risk their employment status in the event  of underperformance and directors  in turn can be voted out by shareholders   The traditional view of the market for corporate control  often known as the take  over market  is one in which shareholders of a company hire and fire management  to achieve better resource utilization  Corporate takeovers can be pursued in several  different ways   One mechanism is the proxy contest  or proxy fight   In a proxy  contest  shareholders are persuaded to vote for a group seeking a controlling position  on a company  s board of directors   Managerial teams can also be displaced through a  tender offer which involves shareholders selling their interests directly to the group  seeking to gain control  A contest for corporate control may attract arbitrageurs and  takeover specialists  who facilitate transfers of control by accumulating long positions  from existing shareholders in the target company and later selling the positions to  the highest bidder  Finally a hostile takeover is an attempt by one entity to acquire  a company without the consent of the company  s management   Preservation of their employment status serves as an incentive for board members  and managers to focus on shareholder wealth maximization  This threat of removal  however can also have negative implications for a company  s corporate governance  practices if the company chooses to adopt anti  takeover measures  such as a stag  gered board or a shareholder rights plan  also known as a poison pill  to reduce the  likelihood of an unwanted takeover  Staggering director elections can dilute the value  of shareholder voting rights by extending the term that each director serves and elim  inating the ability of shareholders to replace the entire board at any given election   Shareholder rights plans enable shareholders to buy additional shares at a discount if  another shareholder purchases a certain percentage of the company  s shares   These  plans are designed to increase the cost to any bidder seeking to take over a company 
6,33,EXAMPLE  
7,33,Shareholder Activism
8,33,Which of the following is true of shareholder activism  A Shareholder activists rarely include hedge funds   B Regulators play a prominent role in shareholder activism  C A primary goal of shareholder activism is to increase shareholder value 
1,34,Factors Affecting Stakeholder Relationships and Corporate Governance
2,34,  
3,34,Solution 
4,34,C is correct   Although the subject of shareholder activism may involve social  and political issues  activist shareholders  primary motivation is to increase  shareholder value  A is incorrect because hedge funds commonly serve as  shareholder activists   B is incorrect because regulators play a prominent role  in standard setting  not shareholder activism 
5,34,    Non  market Factors
6,34,This section focuses on certain non  market factors  such as a company  s legal envi  ronment  the role of the media  and the corporate governance industry that can have  an effect on stakeholder relationships and corporate governance 
7,34,      Legal Environment
8,34,The legal environment in which a company operates can significantly influence the  rights and remedies of stakeholders   Countries that have a common law system  such  as the United Kingdom the United States  India  and Canada  are generally considered  to offer superior protection of the interests of shareholders and creditors relative to  those that have adopted a civil law system  such as France Germany Italy and Japan    The key difference between the two systems lies in the ability of a judge to create laws    In civil law systems  laws are created primarily through statutes and codes enacted by  the legislature  The role of judges is generally limited to rigidly applying the statutes  and codes to the specific case brought before the court   In contrast  in common law  systems  laws are created both from statutes enacted by the legislature and by judges  through judicial opinions   In common law systems  shareholders and creditors have  the ability to appeal to a judge to rule against management actions and decisions  that are not expressly forbidden by statute or code whereas in civil law systems  this  option is generally not possible  Regardless of a country  s legal system creditors are generally more successful in  seeking remedies in court to enforce their rights than shareholders are because share  holder disputes often involve complex legal theories  such as whether a manager or  director breached a duty owed to shareholders   In contrast disputes involving creditors   such as whether the terms of an indenture or other debt contract have been breached  are more straightforward and therefore are more easily determinable by a court  
9,34,      The Media
10,34,The media can affect corporate governance and influence stakeholder relationships  through its ability to spread information quickly and shape public opinion  As an  example negative media attention can adversely affect the reputation or public per  ception of a company or its managers and directors   Senior management s concern  over reputational risk can thus reduce the cost of monitoring management activities  by stakeholders   Media attention can motivate politicians and regulators to introduce  corporate governance reforms or enforce laws that protect stakeholders and society  at large  This influence was evident in the aftermath of the           financial crisis   when significant media attention was a factor in the adoption of new laws and regu  lations designed to address perceived deficiencies in corporate governance  Social media has become a powerful tool that stakeholders have increasingly  used to protect their interests or enhance their influence on corporate matters   Prior  to the advent of social media  companies typically had an advantage in distributing  information because of their considerable resources as well as relationships with  traditional media organizations   Through social media  stakeholders can instantly  broadcast information with little cost or effort and are better able to compete with  company management in influencing public sentiment

2,35,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,35,      The Corporate Governance Industry
4,35,An important catalyst for the rise of the corporate governance industry occurred in       when the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  required US   registered  mutual funds to disclose their proxy voting records annually  The same rule also  required US mutual funds to adopt policies and procedures designed to reasonably  ensure that proxies would be voted in the best interests of their clients   In the years  following the SEC  s      mutual fund rule institutional investors have to varying  degrees  committed additional resources to monitor and vote proxies for the large  number of companies in which they invest   With the increased importance and relevance of corporate governance among inves  tors  the demand for external corporate governance services has grown considerably   In particular some institutional investors have retained outside experts to assist with  corporate governance monitoring and proxy voting   In response to this demand an  industry that provides corporate governance services  including governance ratings and  proxy advice has developed  Because the corporate governance industry is relatively  concentrated these vendors have considerable influence in corporate governance  practices  and in turn corporations are generally compelled to pay attention to ratings  and recommendations produced by the corporate governance industry 
5,35, 
6,35,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND STAKEHOLDER  MANAGEMENT RISKS AND BENEFITS
7,35,As illustrated thus far good corporate governance and stakeholder management can  have a meaningfully positive effect on a company  A company will likely not meet the  expectations of all stakeholders if one group is able to extract private benefits at the  expense of another group  Depending on their nature and magnitude unmanaged  conflicts of interest and weak control over a company  s operations may expose the  company to various risks  such as legal regulatory reputational or default risks   By  adopting effective guidelines for managing the interests of stakeholder groups and  instituting adequate levels of control corporate governance can be reflected in bet  ter company relationships  superior levels of efficiency in operations  and improved  financial performance 
8,35,    Risks of Poor Governance and Stakeholder Management
9,35,Weaknesses in stakeholder management mechanisms or the adoption of poor gover  nance structures can create various risks for a company and its stakeholders   A weak  control environment can encourage misconduct and hinder the ability of the company  to identify and manage risks  
10,35,      Weak Control Systems
11,35,In a company with weak control systems or inefficient monitoring tools  such as poor  audit procedures or insufficient scrutiny by the board one stakeholder group may  benefit at the expense of the company or other stakeholders   This could consequently  have an adverse effect on the company  s resources  performance and value  The audit  deficiencies at Enron for instance prevented the uncovering of the acts of fraud  erroneous accounting records  and other related issues that led to one of the largest  corporate bankruptcies in US history 
1,36,Corporate Governance and Stakeholder Management Risks and Benefits
2,36,  
3,36,      Ineffective Decision Making
4,36,When the quality and quantity of information available to managers are superior to  those available to the board or shareholders  in the absence of sufficient monitoring  tools  managers have an opportunity to make decisions that benefit themselves rela  tive to the company or shareholders   Without proper scrutiny such practices might  go unnoticed  Deficient decisions could include managing the company with a lower  risk profile relative to shareholders  tolerance thus avoiding investment opportunities  that could create value for the company  Conversely manager overconfidence may  result in poor investment decisions without proper examination of their effect on the  company or on shareholders  wealth  Remuneration policies for management could also have significant implications for  the company  Outsized remuneration packages for executives could have an adverse  effect on shareholders  wealth constitute a burden on corporate performance and  affect the interests of other stakeholders  such as employees  customers  or creditors    Remuneration policies that are not carefully designed may also encourage managers  to seek immediate personal gains by taking excessive risks or focusing on creating  short  term performance or stock price increases   Related  party transactions that  underlie unfair terms for the company are another example of activities that are not  aligned with the objective of value creation and that could be facilitated by a poor  governance system 
5,36,      Legal Regulatory and Reputational Risks
6,36,Compliance weaknesses in the implementation of regulatory requirements or lack  of proper reporting practices may expose the company to legal regulatory or rep  utational risks   In such cases  the company may become subject to investigation by  government or regulatory authorities for violation of applicable laws   A company  could also be exposed to lawsuits filed by shareholders  employees  creditors  or other  parties for breach of contractual agreements or company bylaws or for violation of  stakeholders  legal rights   In today  s markets  information flows rapidly  Improperly  managed conflicts of interest or governance failures could bring reputational damage  to the company and its associated costs could be significant   Such risks are partic  ularly acute for publicly listed companies subject to scrutiny by investors  analysts   and other market participants  
7,36,      Default and Bankruptcy Risks
8,36,Poor corporate governance including weak management of creditors  interests  can  affect the company  s financial position and may hinder its ability to honor its debt  obligations   To the extent that the deterioration of corporate performance results in  a debt default  the company may be exposed to bankruptcy risk if creditors choose  to take legal action  The adverse consequences of corporate failures are not limited  to the company  s shareholders   they extend to other stakeholders  such as managers  and employees and even society and the environment  
9,36,    Benefits of Effective Governance and Stakeholder  Management
10,36,The development of good governance practices can play a vital role in aligning the  interests of managers and the board of directors with those of shareholders  while  balancing the interests of the company  s stakeholders   A good governance structure  can be reflected in operational efficiency improved control processes  better financial  performance and lower levels of risk  
1,37,  
2,37,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,37,      Operational Efficiency
4,37,As part of a good governance structure an organization clarifies the delegation of  responsibilities and reporting lines across the company and ensures that all employees  have a clear understanding of their respective duties   When balanced with adequate  internal control mechanisms  the governance structure can ensure that corporate  decisions and activities are properly monitored and controlled to mitigate risk and  help improve the operational efficiency of the company 
5,37,      Improved Control
6,37,Governance practices seek to institute more effective control exercised at all corporate  levels  from shareholders to the board of directors and management   These practices  can help identify and manage risk at early stages that can otherwise hinder corporate  performance and or damage reputation  Control can be enhanced by the proper func  tioning of a company  s audit committee and the effectiveness of its audit systems   By  adopting procedures for monitoring compliance with internal policies and external  regulations and for reporting any violations  the company can better mitigate regu  latory or legal risks and their associated costs   Additionally the adoption of formal  procedures with regard to conflicts of interest and related  party transactions allows  the company to ensure fairness in its relationships with those parties  
7,37,      Better Operating and Financial Performance
8,37,Good governance and stakeholder management can help a company improve its  operating performance and reduce the costs associated with weak control systems    The costs of poor investments  legal proceedings against the company and excessive  perquisites are just a few examples that could be mitigated by well  functioning gov  ernance systems   Enhanced corporate governance could also allow the company to  improve its decision  making process and respond faster to market factors   Proper  remuneration policies are another governance tool that can motivate managers to  make decisions with the objective of creating corporate value 
9,37,      Lower Default Risk and Cost of Debt
10,37,Good corporate governance can lower business and investment risk   Governance  arrangements that manage conflicts of interest with creditors  and that help protect  creditor rights  can reduce a company  s cost of debt and default risk   Default risk can  also often be mitigated by proper functioning of audit systems  improved transparency   e g   reporting of earnings  and the control of information asymmetries between the  company and its capital providers   With regard to credit risk  corporate governance  mechanisms have become increasingly relevant criteria among credit rating agencies  when assessing a company  s creditworthiness  
11,37,EXAMPLE  
12,37,Benefits of Corporate Governance
13,37,Which of the following is not a benefit of an effective corporate governance  structure  A Operating performance can be improved  B A corporation s cost of debt can be reduced  C Corporate decisions and activities require less control 
1,38,Analyst Considerations in Corporate Governance and Stakeholder Management
2,38,  
3,38,Solution 
4,38,C is correct   A benefit of an effective corporate governance system is to enable  adequate scrutiny and control over operations   B is incorrect because an effective  governance structure can reduce investors  perceived credit risk of a corpo  ration thus potentially lowering the corporation s cost of debt   A is incorrect  because operating efficiency may indeed be a benefit of an effective corporate  governance structure 
5,38,ANALYST CONSIDERATIONS IN CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE AND STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT
6,38, 
7,38,In the past  analysts may have considered corporate governance and stakeholder  management issues to be only peripherally related to traditional fundamental analysis    Generally these issues were seen as obscure and unlikely to be material drivers of  performance  Following the aforementioned governance failures in the early     s   the global financial crisis  and the rise of shareholder activism around the world  there is little doubt that governance and stakeholder issues have become increasingly  important topics for analysts   Some key questions that analysts may consider when assessing a company  s cor  porate governance or stakeholder management system are as follows      What is the company  s ownership and voting structure among shareholders     Who represents shareholders on this company  s board     What are the main drivers of the management team s remuneration and incen  tive structure     Who are the significant investors in the company     How robust are the shareholder rights at the company including relative to  peers     How effectively is the company managing long  term risks  such as securing  access to necessary resources  managing human capital exhibiting integrity and  leadership and strengthening the long  term sustainability of the enterprise  A qualitative analysis of these issues typically provided by a company  s proxy  statements  annual reports  and sustainability reports  if available can provide  important insights about the quality of management and sources of potential risk  
8,38,    Economic Ownership and Voting Control
9,38,Generally speaking  corporations with publicly traded equity have a voting structure  that involves one vote for each share  That is  any shareholder  s voting power is equal  to the percentage of the company  s outstanding shares owned by that shareholder   When there are exceptions to this norm and economic ownership becomes separated  from control investors can face significant potential risks   In a small number of markets  dual  class structures are allowed under the local  regulatory framework or exchange rules  which is the most common way that voting  power is decoupled from ownership  In these cases  common shares may be divided  into two classes  one of which has superior voting rights to the other  A common  arrangement is when a share class  for example Class A  carries one vote per share  and is publicly traded whereas another share class  for example Class B  carries several  votes per share and is held exclusively by company insiders or family members   This
1,39,  
2,39,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,39,structure is used by Facebook  for example  In this way the founders and or insiders  of a company may continue to control board elections  strategic decisions  and all  other significant voting matters for a long period even once their ownership level  declines to less than     of the company  s shares   Another mechanism used to separate voting control from economic ownership  is when one class of stock  held by insiders  elects a majority of the board  outside  shareholders who hold a different share class would then be entitled to elect only a  minority of the board  Technically each share carries equal voting rights  but with  this structure the insiders retain substantial power over the affairs of the corporation  because they control a majority of the board  Alibaba s partnership structure is one  example of this type of control  Proponents of dual share systems  such as those just mentioned argue that the  systems promote company stability and enable management to make long  term strate  gic investments  insulated from the short  term pressures of outside investors   Critics  of these structures believe they create conflicts of interest between the providers of  capital and the management of the business   It is virtually impossible for outside investors to dismantle dual  class structures  because of the inherent design of their unequal voting rights   Therefore these struc  tures can remain in place even through generational changes within a founding family   Investors with long time horizons may want to consider the motivations of the con  trolling stockholders  generational dynamics  succession planning  and the relationship  between the board and management   In addition there may be potential valuation  implications because dual  class companies tend to trade at a discount to their peers  
4,39,    Board of Directors Representation
5,39,In most markets  investors have access to basic biographical information about the  non  executive members of corporate boards   Analysts can assess the available infor  mation to determine whether the experience and skill sets on the board match the  current and future needs of the company  In particular questions regarding directors  independence tenure experience and  diversity may bring useful investment insights   For example if the board has multiple  directors engaging in related  party transactions with the company investors may  have cause for concern about any conflicts of interest that arise  The issue of board  tenure can also be a useful tool for investors   Directors with long periods of service  to a company clearly offer valuable experience and expertise but if the board com  position is dominated by such long  tenured members  it may have a negative effect  on the board s diversity and adaptability  An example in which board composition had a significant effect on company  performance occurred at a European pharmaceutical company  At one point in its  history the company had become overleveraged and faced significant financial distress    In response non  executive directors with banking and turnaround experience were  added to the board  With the help of these directors  the company recovered  Seven  years later the most promising product in the company  s pharmaceutical portfolio  began to cause serious side effects in its patient population  The situation required  both a meaningful understanding of the medical issues involved and a rapid response  from the company  However the board was still composed of directors with financial  expertise rather than medical training   The company struggled with its response to  the crisis  and its stock price fell sharply  This situation was one in which the board s  composition had been ideal for a certain point in the company  s history but ultimately  the directors failed to refresh the board s membership as the needs of the business  changed

2,40,  
3,40,    Remuneration and Company Performance
4,40,The availability and quality of information about executive remuneration plans varies  widely across markets   In those markets where such disclosures are available analysts  can assess the elements of the remuneration program to determine whether they  support or conflict with the key drivers of performance for the company  Generally speaking  current executive remuneration programs consist of a base  salary a short  term bonus usually delivered in the form of cash and a multi  year  incentive plan delivered in one or more forms of equity  options  time  vested shares   and or performance  vested shares   Often these short  term and long  term plans are  contingent on achieving financial or operational objectives  and often these objectives  are disclosed  In these situations  an analyst can assess whether the primary drivers  of the remuneration plan are the same factors that  in the analyst s view drive overall  company results   Assessment of the suitability of a remuneration plan for a particular company is  a subjective exercise and is highly dependent on industry and geographic norms   But  there are some warning signs that may warrant particular scrutiny  
5,40,   Plans offering little alignment with shareholders  As an example if a plan
6,40,offers only cash  based payouts and no equity there may be a misalignment of  incentives between executives and investors unless management already owns a  significant stake in the company 
7,40,   Plans exhibiting little variation in results over multiple years  If an award is

12,40,remuneration plans contain payouts tied to specific milestones  such as regu  latory approval of a product  completion of an acquisition or achievement of  specific cost reductions   In addition some companies offer particularly high  post  employment pay arrangements tied to the sale of the company whereas  others offer no such arrangements   These factors are not necessarily negative  features  but investors may want to understand whether the milestones driving  the incentive plan align with the company  s objectives

15,40,    Investors in the Company
16,40,Examining the composition of investors in a company can be another source of useful  insight for analysts   The behavior of these investors can result in both limitations and  catalysts with regard to changes in the corporation  For example cross  shareholdings
1,41,  
2,41,Reading      Corporate Governance and ESG  An Introduction
3,41,are still prevalent in a number of markets   This situation occurs when a company  particularly a publicly listed one holds a large passive minority stake in another  company  Such holdings generally help to protect management from shareholder  pressures because implicit in a cross  shareholding arrangement is the guarantee that  the owner of the shares will support management on all voting issues   In effect  these  shareholdings act as takeover defenses   Similarly the presence of a sizable affiliated stockholder  such as an individual  family trust endowment or private equity fund  can shield a company from the effects  of voting by outside shareholders   As an example a US consumer goods company  has an affiliated charitable foundation that owns more than     of the outstanding  shares   The company also has a provision in its corporate charter requiring that any  changes to the charter must be approved by two  thirds of outstanding shares   As a  result  it is virtually impossible for any measure to pass without the support of the  foundation  The interests of the foundation thus conflict with the interests of the  overall shareholder base  In effect  this single minority shareholder most likely holds  the power to block the votes of the majority  Analysts should note that market context is important in assessing the potential  effects of affiliated stockholders   In certain countries  the presence of such shareholders  is common viewed by local market participants as a means of enhancing stability  strengthening the relationship between companies and their business partners  and  fostering a long  term perspective by protecting the company against hostile takeover  bids   A final aspect of investor composition that has become increasingly relevant  relates to activist shareholders  which we discussed earlier  The presence of activist  shareholders can meaningfully and rapidly change the investment thesis for a company   Experienced activists  together with short  term  oriented investors who follow their  activities  can create substantial turnover in a company  s shareholder composition in  a short amount of time  This is because an activist often serves as a catalyst for new  strategic alternatives at a company and can attract new investors and or arbitrageurs  
4,41,    Strength of Shareholders  Rights
5,41,Within a framework of regional regulations and corporate governance codes  analysts  may want to understand whether the shareholder rights of a particular company are  strong  weak  or average compared with other companies   For example if an ana  lyst s viewpoint includes the possibility that a company will merge in the future he  or she may want to understand whether there are significant structural obstacles to  transactions that are embedded in the company  s charter or bylaws   Similarly if the  thesis involves an outside catalyst  such as an activist shareholder who will introduce  change at the company and improve performance the analyst must take a position  on whether shareholders are sufficiently empowered to advance such a change  If it is  impossible for shareholders to remove directors from the board or to convene special  stockholder meetings  it will be difficult for external initiatives to be successful  In a number of developed markets  including the United Kingdom the Netherlands   and Japan regulatory agencies or stock exchanges have adopted governance codes   which are standards of governance reflecting local investors  expectations with regard  to disclosure board composition shareholder rights  and other related issues   Often  these governance codes are implemented on a  comply or explain  basis  which indi  cates that standards are voluntary in nature  However any deviation from the code  must be explained by the company in a public disclosure  If a company has elected  to deviate from the locally accepted governance practice the analyst may want to  understand the reasoning behind the decision

3,42,    Managing Long  Term Risks
4,42,Analysts may uncover useful insights regarding how a company manages various  issues  such as long  term environmental risks  management of human capital trans  parency and treatment of investors and other stakeholders   Of particular note the  academic evidence linking these and other management quality issues to share price  performance remains mixed in part because indicators of management quality are  often correlated with each other and therefore difficult to isolate  However poor  stakeholder relations and inadequate management of long  term risks have indeed had  an enormous negative effect on share value in certain instances   Therefore analysts  may consider the assessment of such issues to be a useful component of their overall  risk assessment of the company  One way to approach management quality issues is to assess whether the company  demonstrates a persistent pattern of fines  accidents  regulatory penalties  investiga  tions  and the like  A notable example was US coal mining company Massey Energy  which was penalized by environmental and worker  safety agencies numerous times  over multiple years for accidents  safety violations  and repeated breaches of regu  lations   In      an explosion at one of the company  s sites resulted in the deaths of     workers and ultimately the sale of the company and criminal charges against its  executives   Even in the absence of circumstances as extreme as these poor manage  ment of stakeholder interests can have a significant effect on company operations   reputation and valuation 
5,42,    Summary of Analyst Considerations
6,42,The analysis of corporate governance stakeholder management  and other non   financial  often termed  extra  financial   considerations is inherently a subjective  exercise  Governance practices that may raise the risk profile of one company may be  perfectly acceptable in a different context depending on geographic norms  mitigating  circumstances  or the investor  s risk tolerance and investment thesis   In this section  we have provided a basic framework for investors interested in uncovering incremental  insights about a company by analyzing its governance standards  practices  and risks

4,43,Solution to   
5,43,B is correct   Under dual  class share systems  company founders or insiders may  control board elections  strategic decisions  and other significant voting matters    A is incorrect because dual share systems are virtually impossible to dismantle  once adopted  C is incorrect because conflicts of interest between management  and stakeholders are more likely than with single share structures because of  the potential control element under dual systems  
6,43,Solution to

8,43,Solution to   
9,43,C is correct  The presence of activist shareholders can create substantial turnover  in the company  s shareholder composition  A is incorrect because the presence  of activist shareholders can materially change a company  s strategic direction   B is incorrect because long  term investors in a company need to consider how  activist shareholders affect the company

11,43,ESG CONSIDERATIONS FOR INVESTORS
12,43,The inclusion of governance factors in investment analysis has evolved considerably   Management and accountability structures are relatively transparent  and informa  tion regarding them is widely available  Also the risks of poor corporate governance  have long been understood by analysts and shareholders   In contrast  the practice  of considering environmental and social factors  which collectively with governance  form the commonly used acronym  ESG  has evolved more slowly  A large number of  environmental and social issues exist  and identifying which factors are likely to affect  company performance is not an easy task   Issues driving the inclusion of environmental  and social information in the investment process include scarcity of natural resources   climate change global economic and demographic trends  and societal evolution   Although ESG factors were once regarded as intangible or qualitative information  refinements in the identification and analysis of such factors  as well as increased  corporate disclosures  have resulted in increasingly quantifiable information  Still  the process of reflecting quantitative ESG  related information and data in financial  valuation is evolving  
13,43,    ESG Terminology
14,43,Several ESG  related terms exist  and distinguishing among them can be challenging  because of the lack of definitive terminology in the investment community  Among the  most common and broadest terms are sustainable investing  SI  and responsible  investing  RI   Both of these terms refer to identifying companies that in an investor  s  view efficiently manage their financial environmental and human capital resources

3,44,to generate attractive long  term profitability   that is  the companies are deemed to  have  sustainable  business models   Sustainable investing and responsible investing   along with the term ESG investing generally refer to the consideration of ESG factors  in the investment process    Socially responsible investing  SRI  is a related term that tends to have multiple  meanings  creating confusion among investors   Socially responsible investing has tra  ditionally referred to the practice of excluding investments in companies or industries   such as weapons and defense that deviate from an investor  s beliefs   The term has  evolved to include investment objectives that promote positive social attributes  often  by investing in companies with favorable environmental or social profiles  
4,44,    ESG Implementation Approaches
5,44,Implementation approaches to ESG range from value based to values based  The  objective of a value based approach is to mitigate risks and identify opportunities by  analyzing ESG considerations in addition to traditional financial metrics   Conversely  the objective of a values based approach is to express the moral or ethical beliefs of  an investor  Between the value  based and values  based approaches lie a continuum  of approaches that strives for value creation through values investing   Specific implementation approaches to ESG include negative screening  sometimes
6,44,also referred to as exclusionary screening or norms  based screening  positive
7,44,screening  best  in  class approach ESG integration thematic investing  and impact  investing   Negative screening refers to the practice of excluding certain sectors  such  as companies engaged in fossil fuel extraction or production or excluding companies  that deviate from accepted standards in areas such as human rights or environmental  concerns   Many of these negative screens use specific standards  such as the UN Global  Compact s Ten Principles on human rights  labor the environment  and corruption  In contrast to negative screening  positive screening or best  in  class approach  focuses on investments with favorable ESG aspects   Positive screening  typically  implemented through an ESG ranking or scoring approach aims to identify companies  that successfully manage ESG risks and may benefit from ESG  related opportunities  in their sector  For example positive screening may include seeking companies that  promote employee rights  workplace well  being  and customer safety  The best  in  class  approach seeks to identify companies within each industry that rank  or score  most  favorably based on ESG considerations   The best  in  class approach does not exclude  any industries but instead focuses on finding the best representation within each  sector  This approach typically maintains sector weightings comparable to a relative  benchmark index to avoid overweighting or underweighting risk exposures   ESG integration or ESG incorporation refers to the integration of qualitative and  quantitative environmental social and governance factors into traditional security and  industry analysis   The focus of ESG integration is to identify risks and opportunities  arising from ESG factors and to determine whether a company is properly managing  its environmental social and governance resources in accordance with a sustainable  business model  Thematic investing focuses on investing in companies within a specific sector or  following a specific theme such as energy efficiency or climate change  This approach  is often based on needs arising from economic or social trends   Two common ESG   related trends are increased demand for energy and water as well as the availability  of alternative sources of each  Global economic development has raised the demand  for energy whereas increased carbon emissions are believed to negatively affect the  earth s climate  Similarly rising global living standards and heightened industrial needs  have created a greater demand for water along with the need to prevent drought or  limited access to clean drinking water in certain regions of the world

3,45,Impact investing seeks to achieve targeted social or environmental objectives  along with measurable financial returns through engagement with a company or by  direct investment in projects or companies   It has evolved through greater accep  tance that positive social and environmental impact can be consistent with economic  profit generation  Impact investing can be executed through various asset classes and  investment vehicles  often through direct transactions  such as venture capital invest  ing   Another example of impact investing relates to green finance  According to the  Organisation for Economic Co  operation and Development  OECD  green finance  relates to  achieving economic growth while reducing pollution and greenhouse gas  emissions  minimising waste and improving efficiency in the use of natural resources      As with other previously mentioned ESG terms  there are several definitions for green  finance in practice  The primary investment vehicles used in green finance are green  bonds in which issuers earmark the proceeds towards environmental  related projects    Green bond issuance has grown significantly in recent years   According to the Climate  Bond Initiative total worldwide green bond issuance for the first ten months of       totaled USD    billion compared to USD    billion for all of      
4,45,    Catalysts for ESG Growth
5,45,ESG considerations have become increasingly relevant over the past several years  after many investors suffered substantial losses from environmental disasters  social  controversies  or governance deficiencies   In one notable example the      explo  sion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico caused a massive oil  spill resulting in loss of life widespread destruction of marine and wildlife habitats   and economic damage to surrounding tourism destinations   As a result of BP plc  s  economic interest in the rig  the company incurred tens of billions of dollars in fines   remuneration claims  and clean  up costs    In addition to environmental issues  investors have become increasingly conscious  of workplace human rights  and governance issues and the costs associated with  them  For example Walmart lost a      appeals court ruling on a US      million  class action lawsuit over wage and hour discrimination  Over the years  Walmart  has faced numerous employee strikes and lawsuits over labor and human rights  violations and the company has paid a significant amount of money to settle claims  and lawsuits   An example of investor loss related to corporate governance occurred  in      at German automaker Volkswagen  Specifically many investors believed that  inadequate governance oversight at Volkswagen permitted more than    million of  its diesel cars to pass emissions tests yet emit unlawful amounts of nitrogen oxide   Many investors attributed their losses to internal audit and compliance shortcomings   as well as a lack of independence in Volkswagen s board of directors   The company  ultimately incurred several billion dollars of civil and criminal penalties   Another investor development that has supported ESG growth is the adoption  of more sophisticated views about sustainable growth and its effect on investment  performance  To this end some large institutional asset owners embrace the con  cept of being  universal owners    Universal owners are long  term investors  such as  pension funds  that have significant assets invested in globally diversified portfolios    Given their size and scope the investment portfolios of universal owners are linked  to economic growth and unavoidably exposed to costs resulting from external factors   such as environmental damages   Because their funds  long  term performance and the  interests of their beneficiaries are at stake some universal owners strive to positively

4,46,    ESG Market Overview
5,46,Reflecting the growth of ESG  related information in the marketplace the amount  of global assets under management  AUM  dedicated to the consideration of ESG  factors in portfolio selection and management has increased substantially  According  to the Global Sustainable Investing Alliance  GSIA  a collaboration of organizations  dedicated to advancing sustainable investing in the financial markets  about US    tril  lion of AUM were dedicated toward sustainable investment mandates as of year  end        Europe       and the United States       accounted for the vast majority of  these AUM  Determining the true size of the ESG investment universe is difficult   however because managers and investors define and implement ESG mandates in  many different ways   There are often differences regarding which ESG factors should  be considered as well as how they are considered in the investment process    The increased interest in sustainable investing has led to increased corporate  disclosures of ESG issues  as well as a growing number of companies that collect and  analyze ESG data   In addition to the GSIA  several organizations have been formed  to monitor and advance the mission of sustainable investing   For example the Global  Reporting Initiative  GRI  a non  profit organization formed in      produces a  sustainability reporting framework that measures and reports sustainability  related  issues and performance  In      the United Nations and a consortium of institutional  investors launched the Principles of Responsible Investment  PRI  to support investors  committed to including ESG issues into their investment decision  making and own  ership practices   In      the non  profit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board   SASB  was formed to develop sustainability accounting standards for companies when  disclosing material ESG information  In addition to these key organizations  several  others exist that promote the advancement of sustainable investing   To help educate  investors  CFA Institute published  Environmental Social and Governance Issues in  Investing  A Guide for Investment Professionals  in November       
6,46,    ESG Factors in Investment Analysis
7,46,The materiality of ESG factors in investment analysis  particularly environmental and  social factors  often differ meaningfully among sectors   An ESG factor is considered to  be material when it is believed to have an impact on a company  s long  term business  model  For example environmental factors such as emissions and water usage will  likely be significant for utilities or mining companies  yet are relatively inconsequential  for financial institutions   Overall environmental factors that are generally considered material in invest  ment analysis include natural resource management  pollution prevention water  conservation energy efficiency and reduced emissions  the existence of carbon assets   and adherence to environmental safety and regulatory standards   A specific concern  among investors of energy companies is also the existence of  stranded assets   i e   carbon  intensive assets that are at risk of no longer being economically viable because  of changes in regulation or investor sentiment   Analysts may find it difficult to assess  potentially significant financial risks of energy companies because of limited infor  mation on the existence of these companies  carbon assets  as well as the difficulty in  determining political and regulatory risks   Material environmental effects can arise

4,48,SUMMARY
5,48,The investment community has increasingly recognized the importance of corporate  governance as well as environmental and social considerations   Although practices  concerning corporate governance  and ESG overall  will undoubtedly continue to  evolve investment analysts who have a good understanding of these concepts can  better appreciate the implications of ESG considerations in investment decision  making   The core concepts covered in this reading are as follows      Corporate governance can be defined as a system of controls and procedures by  which individual companies are managed     There are many systems of corporate governance most reflecting the influences  of either shareholder theory or stakeholder theory or both  Current trends   however point to increasing convergence     A corporation s governance system is influenced by several stakeholder groups   and the interests of the groups often diverge or conflict      The primary stakeholder groups of a corporation consist of shareholders  credi  tors  managers and employees  the board of directors  customers  suppliers  and  government regulators      A principal agent relationship  or agency relationship  entails a principal hiring  an agent to perform a particular task or service  In a corporate structure such  relationships often lead to conflicts among various stakeholders      Stakeholder management involves identifying  prioritizing  and understanding  the interests of stakeholder groups and on that basis managing the company  s  relationships with stakeholders   The framework of corporate governance and  stakeholder management reflects a legal contractual organizational and gov  ernmental infrastructure     Mechanisms of stakeholder management may include general meetings  a board  of directors  the audit function company reporting and transparency related   party transactions  remuneration policies  including say on pay  and other  mechanisms to manage the company  s relationship with its creditors  employ  ees  customers  suppliers  and regulators      A board of directors is the central pillar of the governance structure serves  as the link between shareholders and managers  and acts as the shareholders   internal monitoring tool within the company     The structure and composition of a board of directors vary across countries and  companies   The number of directors may vary and the board typically includes  a mix of expertise levels  backgrounds  and competencies      Executive  internal  directors are employed by the company and are typically  members of senior management   Non  executive  external  directors have lim  ited involvement in daily operations but serve an important oversight role     Two primary duties of a board of directors are duty of care and duty of loyalty

3,54,very costly  Indeed the real capital investments of a company describe a com  pany better than its working capital or capital structures  which are intangible  and tend to be similar for many corporations      Second the principles of capital budgeting have been adapted for many other  corporate decisions  such as investments in working capital leasing  mergers  and acquisitions  and bond refunding      Third the valuation principles used in capital budgeting are similar to the  valuation principles used in security analysis and portfolio management   Many  of the methods used by security analysts and portfolio managers are based on  capital budgeting methods   Conversely there have been innovations in secu  rity analysis and portfolio management that have also been adapted to capital  budgeting      Finally although analysts have a vantage point outside the company their inter  est in valuation coincides with the capital budgeting focus of maximizing share  holder value  Because capital budgeting information is not ordinarily available  outside the company the analyst may attempt to estimate the process  within  reason at least for companies that are not too complex   Further analysts may  be able to appraise the quality of the company  s capital budgeting process for  example on the basis of whether the company has an accounting focus or an  economic focus   This reading is organized as follows   Section   presents the steps in a typical  capital budgeting process   After introducing the basic principles of capital budgeting  in Section   in Section   we discuss the criteria by which a decision to invest in a  project may be made 
4,54,THE CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
5,54,The specific capital budgeting procedures that a manager uses depend on the manag  er  s level in the organization the size and complexity of the project being evaluated  and the size of the organization  The typical steps in the capital budgeting process  are as follows      Step One  Generating Ideas Investment ideas can come from anywhere from  the top or the bottom of the organization from any department or functional  area  or from outside the company  Generating good investment ideas to con  sider is the most important step in the process      Step Two  Analyzing Individual Proposals This step involves gathering the  information to forecast cash flows for each project and then evaluating the  project s profitability     Step Three  Planning the Capital Budget The company must organize the  profitable proposals into a coordinated whole that fits within the company  s  overall strategies  and it also must consider the projects  timing   Some projects  that look good when considered in isolation may be undesirable strategically   Because of financial and real resource issues  the scheduling and prioritizing of  projects is important      Step Four   Monitoring and Post  auditing In a post  audit  actual results  are compared to planned or predicted results  and any differences must be  explained  For example how do the revenues  expenses  and cash flows realized  from an investment compare to the predictions  Post  auditing capital proj  ects is important for several reasons   First  it helps monitor the forecasts and

3,55,analysis that underlie the capital budgeting process   Systematic errors  such as  overly optimistic forecasts  become apparent   Second it helps improve business  operations   If sales or costs are out of line it will focus attention on bringing  performance closer to expectations if at all possible  Finally monitoring and  post  auditing recent capital investments will produce concrete ideas for future  investments   Managers can decide to invest more heavily in profitable areas and  scale down or cancel investments in areas that are disappointing   Planning for capital investments can be very complex often involving many persons  inside and outside of the company  Information about marketing  science engineering   regulation taxation finance production and behavioral issues must be systematically  gathered and evaluated  The authority to make capital decisions depends on the size  and complexity of the project   Lower  level managers may have discretion to make  decisions that involve less than a given amount of money or that do not exceed a given  capital budget   Larger and more complex decisions are reserved for top management   and some are so significant that the company  s board of directors ultimately has the  decision  making authority  Like everything else capital budgeting is a cost benefit exercise  At the margin  the benefits from the improved decision making should exceed the costs of the capital  budgeting efforts   Companies often put capital budgeting projects into some rough categories for  analysis   One such classification would be as follows     Replacement projects   These are among the easier capital budgeting decisions    If a piece of equipment breaks down or wears out  whether to replace it may not  require careful analysis   If the expenditure is modest and if not investing has  significant implications for production operations  or sales  it would be a waste  of resources to overanalyze the decision  Just make the replacement   Other  replacement decisions involve replacing existing equipment with newer more  efficient equipment  or perhaps choosing one type of equipment over another   These replacement decisions are often amenable to very detailed analysis  and  you might have a lot of confidence in the final decision    Expansion projects   Instead of merely maintaining a company  s existing busi  ness activities  expansion projects increase the size of the business   These  expansion decisions may involve more uncertainties than replacement deci  sions  and these decisions will be more carefully considered    New products and services   These investments expose the company to even  more uncertainties than expansion projects   These decisions are more complex  and will involve more people in the decision  making process     Regulatory safety and environmental projects   These projects are frequently  required by a governmental agency an insurance company or some other  external party  They may generate no revenue and might not be undertaken by a  company maximizing its own private interests   Often the company will accept  the required investment and continue to operate  Occasionally however the  cost of the regulatory safety environmental project is sufficiently high that the  company would do better to cease operating altogether or to shut down any  part of the business that is related to the project     Other  The projects above are all susceptible to capital budgeting analysis  and  they can be accepted or rejected using the net present value  NPV   or some  other criterion  Some projects escape such analysis   These are either pet proj  ects of someone in the company  such as the CEO buying a new aircraft  or  so risky that they are difficult to analyze by the usual methods  such as some  research and development decisions

4,56,BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CAPITAL BUDGETING
5,56,Capital budgeting has a rich history and sometimes employs some pretty sophisticated  procedures   Fortunately capital budgeting relies on just a few basic principles   Capital  budgeting usually uses the following assumptions     Decisions are based on cash flows   The decisions are not based on accounting  concepts  such as net income  Furthermore intangible costs and benefits are  often ignored because if they are real they should result in cash flows at some  other time    Timing of cash flows is crucial  Analysts make an extraordinary effort to detail  precisely when cash flows occur    Cash flows are based on opportunity costs   What are the incremental cash flows  that occur with an investment compared to what they would have been without  the investment    Cash flows are analyzed on an after  tax basis   Taxes must be fully reflected in  all capital budgeting decisions     Financing costs are ignored  This may seem unrealistic but it is not   Most of  the time analysts want to know the after  tax operating cash flows that result  from a capital investment   Then these after  tax cash flows and the investment  outlays are discounted at the  required rate of return  to find the net present  value  NPV    Financing costs are reflected in the required rate of return  If we  included financing costs in the cash flows and in the discount rate we would be  double  counting the financing costs   So even though a project may be financed  with some combination of debt and equity we ignore these costs  focusing on  the operating cash flows and capturing the costs of debt  and other capital  in  the discount rate    Capital budgeting cash flows are not accounting net income  Accounting  net income is reduced by noncash charges such as accounting depreciation   Furthermore to reflect the cost of debt financing  interest expenses are also  subtracted from accounting net income   No subtraction is made for the cost of  equity financing in arriving at accounting net income   Accounting net income  also differs from economic income which is the cash inflow plus the change in  the market value of the company  Economic income does not subtract the cost  of debt financing  and it is based on the changes in the market value of the  company not changes in its book value  accounting depreciation    In assumption   above we referred to the rate used in discounting the cash flows  as the  required rate of return   The required rate of return is the discount rate that  investors should require given the riskiness of the project   This discount rate is fre  quently called the  opportunity cost of funds  or the  cost of capital   If the company  can invest elsewhere and earn a return of r or if the company can repay its sources  of capital and save a cost of r then r is the company  s opportunity cost of funds   If  the company cannot earn more than its opportunity cost of funds on an investment   it should not undertake that investment   Unless an investment earns more than the  cost of funds from its suppliers of capital the investment should not be undertaken   The cost  of  capital concept is discussed more extensively elsewhere  Regardless of  what it is called an economically sound discount rate is essential for making capital  budgeting decisions  
1,57,Basic Principles of Capital Budgeting
2,57,  
3,57,Although the principles of capital budgeting are simple they are easily confused in  practice leading to unfortunate decisions   Some important capital budgeting concepts  that managers find very useful are given below     A sunk cost is one that has already been incurred  You cannot change a sunk  cost   Today  s decisions  on the other hand should be based on current and  future cash flows and should not be affected by prior or sunk  costs      An opportunity cost is what a resource is worth in its next  best use  For  example if a company uses some idle property what should it record as the  investment outlay   the purchase price several years ago the current market  value or nothing  If you replace an old machine with a new one what is the  opportunity cost  If you invest     million what is the opportunity cost  The  answers to these three questions are respectively   the current market value the  cash flows the old machine would generate and     million  which you could  invest elsewhere      An incremental cash flow is the cash flow that is realized because of a deci  sion  the cash flow with a decision minus the cash flow without that decision  If  opportunity costs are correctly assessed the incremental cash flows provide a  sound basis for capital budgeting      An externality is the effect of an investment on other things besides the invest  ment itself  Frequently an investment affects the cash flows of other parts of the  company and these externalities can be positive or negative  If possible these  should be part of the investment decision  Sometimes externalities occur out  side of the company  An investment might benefit  or harm  other companies  or society at large and yet the company is not compensated for these benefits   or charged for the costs   Cannibalization is one externality  Cannibalization  occurs when an investment takes customers and sales away from another part  of the company 
4,57,   Conventional cash flows versus nonconventional cash flows A conventional
5,57,cash flow pattern is one with an initial outflow followed by a series of inflows    In a nonconventional cash flow pattern the initial outflow is not followed by  inflows only but the cash flows can flip from positive to negative again  or even  change signs several times   An investment that involved outlays  negative cash  flows  for the first couple of years that were then followed by positive cash flows  would be considered to have a conventional pattern  If cash flows change signs  once the pattern is conventional  If cash flows change signs two or more times   the pattern is nonconventional  Several types of project interactions make the incremental cash flow analysis  challenging   The following are some of these interactions  
6,57,   Independent projects versus mutually exclusive projects Independent
7,57,projects are projects whose cash flows are independent of each other  Mutually  exclusive projects compete directly with each other  For example if Projects A  and B are mutually exclusive you can choose A or B but you cannot choose  both  Sometimes there are several mutually exclusive projects  and you can  choose only one from the group     Project sequencing Many projects are sequenced through time so that  investing in a project creates the option to invest in future projects   For exam  ple you might invest in a project today and then in one year invest in a second
1,58,  
2,58,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,58,project if the financial results of the first project or new economic conditions  are favorable  If the results of the first project or new economic conditions are  not favorable you do not invest in the second project      Unlimited funds versus capital rationing An unlimited funds environment  assumes that the company can raise the funds it wants for all profitable proj  ects simply by paying the required rate of return  Capital rationing exists when  the company has a fixed amount of funds to invest   If the company has more  profitable projects than it has funds for it must allocate the funds to achieve the  maximum shareholder value subject to the funding constraints  
4,58, 
5,58,INVESTMENT DECISION CRITERIA
6,58,Analysts use several important criteria to evaluate capital investments   The two most  comprehensive measures of whether a project is profitable or unprofitable are the  net present value  NPV   and internal rate of return  IRR   In addition to these we  present four other criteria that are frequently used  the payback period discounted  payback period average accounting rate of return  AAR  and profitability index  PI    An analyst must fully understand the economic logic behind each of these investment  decision criteria as well as its strengths and limitations in practice 
7,58,    Net Present Value
8,58,For a project with one investment outlay made initially the net present value  NPV    is the present value of the future after  tax cash flows minus the investment outlay or

1,59,Investment Decision Criteria
2,59,  
3,59,The investment has a total value or present value of future cash flows  of          million  Since this investment can be acquired at a cost of     million the  investing company is giving up     million of its wealth in exchange for an investment  worth         million  The investor  s wealth increases by a net of         million  Because the NPV is the amount by which the investor  s wealth increases as a result  of the investment  the decision rule for the NPV is as follows  
4,59,Invest if Do not invest if
5,59,NPV     NPV    
6,59,Positive NPV investments are wealth  increasing  whereas negative NPV invest  ments are wealth  decreasing   Many investments have cash flow patterns in which outflows may occur not only  at time zero but also at future dates   It is useful to consider the NPV to be the present  value of all cash flows

43,59,In Equation    the investment outlay CF  is simply a negative cash flow  Future  cash flows can also be negative 
44,59,    Internal Rate of Return
45,59,The internal rate of return  IRR  is one of the most frequently used concepts in capital  budgeting and in security analysis   The IRR definition is one that all analysts know by  heart   For a project with one investment outlay made initially the IRR is the discount  rate that makes the present value of the future after  tax cash flows equal that invest  ment outlay  Written out in equation form the IRR solves this equation

56,59,where IRR is the internal rate of return  The left  hand side of this equation is the  present value of the project s future cash flows  which discounted at the IRR  equals  the investment outlay  This equation will also be seen rearranged as

69,59,In this form Equation    looks like the NPV equation Equation    except that the  discount rate is the IRR instead of r  the required rate of return   Discounted at the  IRR  the NPV is equal to zero  In the Gerhardt Corporation example we want to find a discount rate that makes  the total present value of all cash flows  the NPV equal zero  In equation form the  IRR is the discount rate that solves this equation

103,59,Algebraically this equation would be very difficult to solve  We normally resort to  trial and error systematically choosing various discount rates until we find one the  IRR  that satisfies the equation  We previously discounted these cash flows at    per  cent and found the NPV to be         million  Since the NPV is positive the IRR is
104,59,   
105,59,   
1,60,  
2,60,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,60,probably greater than    percent   If we use    percent as the discount rate the NPV  is         million so    percent is a little high  One might try several other discount  rates until the NPV is equal to zero  this approach is illustrated in Table

10,60,The IRR is       percent  Financial calculators and spreadsheet software have routines  that calculate the IRR for us  so we do not have to go through this trial and error  procedure ourselves   The IRR  computed more precisely is         percent   The decision rule for the IRR is to invest if the IRR exceeds the required rate of  return for a project  
11,60,Invest if Do not invest if
12,60,IRR   r IRR   r
13,60,In the Gerhardt example since the IRR of       percent exceeds the project s required  rate of return of    percent  Gerhardt should invest   Many investments have cash flow patterns in which the outlays occur at time zero  and at future dates   Thus  it is common to define the IRR as the discount rate that  makes the present values of all cash flows sum to zero

28,60,    Payback Period
29,60,The payback period is the number of years required to recover the original investment  in a project  The payback is based on cash flows   For example if you invest     million  in a project  how long will it be until you recover the full original investment  Table    below illustrates the calculation of the payback period by following an investment s  cash flows and cumulative cash flows

3,61,In the first year the company recovers      of the original investment with      still  unrecovered  You can see that the company recoups its original investment between  Year   and Year    After three years       is still unrecovered  Since the Year   cash  flow is      it would take two  thirds of the Year   cash flow to bring the cumulative  cash flow to zero  So the payback period is three years plus two  thirds of the Year    cash flow or      years   The drawbacks of the payback period are transparent   Since the cash flows are not  discounted at the project s required rate of return the payback period ignores the time  value of money and the risk of the project   Additionally the payback period ignores  cash flows after the payback period is reached  In the table above for example the  Year   cash flow is completely ignored in the payback computation  Example    is designed to illustrate some of the implications of these drawbacks  of the payback period

28,61,Comment on why the payback period provides misleading information  about the following    Project A     Project B versus Project C     Project D versus Project E     Project D versus Project F 
29,61,Solution to   
30,61,Project A does indeed pay itself back in one year  However this result is mis  leading because the investment is unprofitable with a negative NPV 
1,62,  
2,62,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,62,Solution to   
4,62,Although Projects B and C have the same payback period and the same cash  flow after the payback period the payback period does not detect the fact that  Project C  s cash flows within the payback period occur earlier and result in a  higher NPV 
5,62,Solution to   
6,62,Projects D and E illustrate a common situation  The project with the shorter  payback period is the less profitable project   Project E has a longer payback and  higher NPV 
7,62,Solution to   
8,62,Projects D and F illustrate an important flaw of the payback period that the  payback period ignores cash flows after the payback period is reached  In this  case Project F has a much larger cash flow in Year   but the payback period  does not recognize its value 
9,62,The payback period has many drawbacks it is a measure of payback and not a  measure of profitability  By itself the payback period would be a dangerous criterion  for evaluating capital projects   Its simplicity however is an advantage  The payback  period is very easy to calculate and to explain  The payback period may also be used  as an indicator of project liquidity  A project with a two  year payback may be more  liquid than another project with a longer payback   Because it is not economically sound the payback period has no decision rule like  that of the NPV or IRR   If the payback period is being used  perhaps as a measure of  liquidity  analysts should also use an NPV or IRR to ensure that their decisions also  reflect the profitability of the projects being considered 
10,62,    Discounted Payback Period
11,62,The discounted payback period is the number of years it takes for the cumulative  discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment   The discounted  payback period partially addresses the weaknesses of the payback period  Table   gives  an example of calculating the payback period and discounted payback period  The  example assumes a discount rate of    percent

28,62,The payback period is three years plus                of the fourth year  s cash flow  or      years   The discounted payback period is between four and five years   The  discounted payback period is four years plus                      of the fifth year  s  discounted cash flow or      years  
1,63,Investment Decision Criteria
2,63,  
3,63,The discounted payback period relies on discounted cash flows  much as the NPV  criterion does   If a project has a negative NPV it will usually not have a discounted  payback period since it never recovers the initial investment   The discounted payback does account for the time value of money and risk within  the discounted payback period but it ignores cash flows after the discounted payback  period is reached  This drawback has two consequences   First the discounted payback  period is not a good measure of profitability because it ignores these cash flows   Second  another idiosyncrasy of the discounted payback period comes from the possibility of  negative cash flows after the discounted payback period is reached  It is possible for a  project to have a negative NPV but to have a positive cumulative discounted cash flow  in the middle of its life and thus  a reasonable discounted payback period  The NPV  and IRR  which consider all of a project s cash flows  do not suffer from this problem 
4,63,    Average Accounting Rate of Return
5,63,The average accounting rate of return  AAR  can be defined as
6,63,AAR Average net income Average book value
7,63, 
8,63,To understand this measure of return we will use a numerical example  Assume a company invests         in a project that is depreciated straight  line  over a five  year life to a zero salvage value  Sales revenues and cash operating expenses  for each year are as shown in Table    The table also shows the annual income taxes   at a    percent tax rate  and the net income

22,63,a Negative taxes occur in Year   because the earnings before taxes of         can be deducted against earnings on other projects  thus  reducing the tax bill by       
23,63,For the five  year period the average net income is         The initial book value  is         declining by        per year until the final book value is     The average  book value for this asset is                                The average accounting  rate of return is

30,63, 
31,63,The advantages of the AAR are that it is easy to understand and easy to calculate   The AAR has some important disadvantages  however  Unlike the other capital bud  geting criteria discussed here the AAR is based on accounting numbers and not based  on cash flows   This is an important conceptual and practical limitation  The AAR also  does not account for the time value of money and there is no conceptually sound  cutoff for the AAR that distinguishes between profitable and unprofitable investments    The AAR is frequently calculated in different ways  so the analyst should verify the
1,64,  
2,64,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,64,formula behind any AAR numbers that are supplied by someone else  Analysts should  know the AAR and its potential limitations in practice but they should rely on more  economically sound methods like the NPV and IRR  
4,64,    Profitability Index
5,64,The profitability index  PI  is the present value of a project s future cash flows divided  by the initial investment   It can be expressed as
6,64,PI
7,64, 
8,64,PV of future cash flows Initial investment
9,64,   
10,64, 
11,64,NPV Initial  iinvestment
12,64,   
13,64,You can see that the PI is closely related to the NPV  The PI is the ratio of the PV of  future cash flows to the initial investment  whereas an NPV is the difference between  the PV of future cash flows and the initial investment   Whenever the NPV is positive  the PI will be greater than      conversely whenever the NPV is negative the PI will  be less than      The investment decision rule for the PI is as follows  
14,64,Invest if Do not invest if
15,64,PI       PI      
16,64,Because the PV of future cash flows equals the initial investment plus the NPV the  PI can also be expressed as     plus the ratio of the NPV to the initial investment  as  shown in Equation   above  Example   illustrates the PI calculation 
17,64,EXAMPLE  
18,64,Example of a PI Calculation
19,64,The Gerhardt Corporation investment  discussed earlier  had an outlay of      million a present value of future cash flows of         million and an NPV  of         million  The profitability index is

37,64,Because the PI       this is a profitable investment  
38,64,The PI indicates the value you are receiving in exchange for one unit of currency  invested  Although the PI is used less frequently than the NPV and IRR  it is sometimes  used as a guide in capital rationing   The PI is usually called the profitability index in  corporations  but it is commonly referred to as a  benefit cost ratio  in governmental  and not  for  profit organizations  
39,64,    NPV Profile
40,64,The NPV profile shows a project s NPV graphed as a function of various discount  rates   Typically the NPV is graphed vertically  on the y axis  and the discount rates  are graphed horizontally  on the x axis   The NPV profile for the Gerhardt capital  budgeting project is shown in Example   
1,65,Investment Decision Criteria
2,65,  
3,65,EXAMPLE  
4,65,NPV Profile
5,65,For the Gerhardt example we have already calculated several NPVs for differ  ent discount rates   At    percent the NPV is         million  at    percent the  NPV is         million  and at       percent  the IRR  the NPV is zero  What  is the NPV if the discount rate is   percent  The NPV discounted at   percent  is     million which is simply the sum of all of the undiscounted cash flows    Table   and Figure   show the NPV profile for the Gerhardt example for discount  rates between   percent and    percent

21,65,Three interesting points on this NPV profile are where the profile goes through  the vertical axis  the NPV when the discount rate is zero  where the profile goes  through the horizontal axis  where the discount rate is the IRR  and the NPV  for the required rate of return  NPV is         million when the discount rate  is the    percent required rate of return  
1,66,  
2,66,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,66,The NPV profile in Figure   is very well  behaved  The NPV declines at a decreas  ing rate as the discount rate increases   The profile is convex from the origin  convex  from below   You will shortly see some examples in which the NPV profile is more  complicated 
4,66,    Ranking Conflicts between NPV and IRR
5,66,For a single conventional project  the NPV and IRR will agree on whether to invest or  to not invest   For independent  conventional projects  no conflict exists between the  decision rules for the NPV and IRR   However in the case of two mutually exclusive  projects  the two criteria will sometimes disagree  For example Project A might have  a larger NPV than Project B but Project B has a higher IRR than Project A   In this  case should you invest in Project A or in Project B  Differing cash flow patterns can cause two projects to rank differently with the  NPV and IRR   For example suppose Project A has shorter  term payoffs than Project  B  This situation is presented in Example   
6,66,EXAMPLE  
7,66,Ranking Conflict Due to Differing Cash Flow Patterns
8,66,Projects A and B have similar outlays but different patterns of future cash flows    Project A realizes most of its cash payoffs earlier than Project B  The cash flows   as well as the NPV and IRR for the two projects  are shown in Table    For both  projects  the required rate of return is    percent

25,67,Project B  broken line  has the higher NPV for discount rates between   per  cent and       percent   Project A  solid line  has the higher NPV for discount  rates exceeding       percent   The crossover point of       percent in Figure    corresponds to the discount rate at which both projects have the same NPV  of          Project B has the higher NPV below the crossover point  and Project A  has the higher NPV above it  
26,67,Whenever the NPV and IRR rank two mutually exclusive projects differently as  they do in the example above you should choose the project based on the NPV  Project  B with the higher NPV is the better project because of the reinvestment assumption   Mathematically whenever you discount a cash flow at a particular discount rate you  are implicitly assuming that you can reinvest a cash flow at that same discount rate    In the NPV calculation you use a discount rate of    percent for both projects   In the  IRR calculation you use a discount rate equal to the IRR of       percent for Project  A and       percent for Project B 
27,67,  For example assume that you are receiving      in one year discounted at     percent   The present  value is                      Instead of receiving the      in one year invest it for one additional year at      percent  and it grows to       What is the present value of      received in two years discounted at      percent  It is the same         Because both future cash flows are worth the same you are implicitly  assuming that reinvesting the earlier cash flow at the discount rate of    percent has no effect on its value 
1,68,  
2,68,Reading      Capital Budgeting
3,68,Can you reinvest the cash inflows from the projects at    percent or       percent  or       percent  When you assume the required rate of return is    percent  you are  assuming an opportunity cost of    percent that you can either find other projects  that pay a    percent return or pay back your sources of capital that cost you    per  cent   The fact that you earned       percent in Project A or       percent in Project  B does not mean that you can reinvest future cash flows at those rates    In fact  if you  can reinvest future cash flows at        percent or        percent  these should have  been used as your required rate of return instead of     percent    Because the NPV  criterion uses the most realistic discount rate the opportunity cost of funds the  NPV criterion should be used for evaluating mutually exclusive projects   Another circumstance that frequently causes mutually exclusive projects to be  ranked differently by NPV and IRR criteria is project scale the sizes of the projects    Would you rather have a small project with a higher rate of return or a large project  with a lower rate of return  Sometimes  the larger low rate of return project has the  better NPV  This case is developed in Example   
4,68,EXAMPLE  
5,68,Ranking Conflicts due to Differing Project Scale
6,68,Project A has a much smaller outlay than Project B although they have similar  future cash flow patterns   The cash flows  as well as the NPVs and IRRs for  the two projects  are shown in Table     For both projects  the required rate of  return is    percent

27,69,The good news is that the NPV and IRR criteria will usually indicate the same  investment decision for a given project  They will usually both recommend acceptance  or rejection of the project  When the choice is between two mutually exclusive projects  and the NPV and IRR rank the two projects differently the NPV criterion is strongly  preferred  There are good reasons for this preference  The NPV shows the amount of  gain or wealth increase as a currency amount   The reinvestment assumption of the  NPV is the more economically realistic  The IRR does give you a rate of return but the  IRR could be for a small investment or for only a short period of time  As a practical  matter once a corporation has the data to calculate the NPV it is fairly trivial to go  ahead and calculate the IRR and other capital budgeting criteria   However the most  appropriate and theoretically sound criterion is the NPV

3,70,    The Multiple IRR Problem and the No IRR Problem
4,70,A problem that can arise with the IRR criterion is the  multiple IRR problem   We  can illustrate this problem with the following nonconventional cash flow pattern

27,70,It turns out that there are two values of IRR that satisfy the equation  IRR             and IRR             To further understand this problem consider the NPV profile  for this investment  which is shown in Table    and Figure    As you can see in the NPV profile the NPV is equal to zero at IRR        and IRR          The NPV is negative for discount rates below     percent  positive between      percent and     percent  and then negative above     percent   The NPV reaches  its highest value when the discount rate is     percent   It is also possible to have an investment project with no IRR   The  no  IRR problem   occurs with this cash flow pattern

49,70,For these cash flows  no discount rate exists that results in a zero NPV  Does that mean  this project is a bad investment  In this case the project is actually a good investment   As Table    and Figure   show the NPV is positive for all discount rates   The lowest  NPV of    occurs for a discount rate of       percent  and the NPV is always greater  than zero  Consequently no IRR exists

27,72,For conventional projects that have outlays followed by inflows negative cash flows  followed by positive cash flows the multiple IRR problem cannot occur  However  for nonconventional projects  as in the example above the multiple IRR problem can  occur  The IRR equation is essentially an nth degree polynomial  An nth degree poly  nomial can have up to n solutions  although it will have no more real solutions than  the number of cash flow sign changes   For example a project with two sign changes  could have zero one or two IRRs   Having two sign changes does not mean that you  will have multiple IRRs   it just means that you might  Fortunately most capital bud  geting projects have only one IRR   Analysts should always be aware of the unusual  cash flow patterns that can generate the multiple IRR problem 
28,72,     Popularity and Usage of the Capital Budgeting Methods
29,72,Analysts need to know the basic logic of the various capital budgeting criteria as well  as the practicalities involved in using them in real corporations   Before delving into  the many issues involved in applying these models  we would like to present some  feedback on their popularity  The usefulness of any analytical tool always depends on the specific application   Corporations generally find these capital budgeting criteria useful  Two surveys by  Graham and Harvey        and Brounen De Jong  and Koedijk        report on the  frequency of their use by US and European corporations   Table     gives the mean

17,73,a These techniques were described in this section of the reading   You will encounter the others elsewhere  Note  Respondents used a scale ranging from    never  to    always  
18,73,Although financial textbooks preach the superiority of the NPV and IRR tech  niques  it is clear that several other methods are heavily used   In the four European  countries  the payback period is used as often as  or even slightly more often than the  NPV and IRR   In these two studies  larger companies tended to prefer the NPV and  IRR over the payback period  The fact that the US companies were larger on aver  age partially explains the greater US preference for the NPV and IRR   Other factors  influence the choice of capital budgeting techniques   Private corporations used the  payback period more frequently than did public corporations   Companies managed  by an MBA had a stronger preference for the discounted cash flow techniques   Of  course any survey research also has some limitations   In this case the persons in  these large corporations responding to the surveys may not have been aware of all of  the applications of these techniques   These capital budgeting techniques are essential tools for corporate managers    Capital budgeting is also relevant to external analysts   Because a corporation s investing  decisions ultimately determine the value of its financial obligations  the corporation s  investing processes are vital  The NPV criterion is the criterion most directly related  to stock prices   If a corporation invests in positive NPV projects  these should add to  the wealth of its shareholders   Example   illustrates this scenario 
19,73,  Analysts often refer to the NPV and IRR as  discounted cash flow techniques  because they accurately  account for the timing of all cash flows when they are discounted

4,74,NPVs and Stock Prices
5,74,Freitag Corporation is investing       million in distribution facilities   The  present value of the future after  tax cash flows is estimated to be      million   Freitag has     million outstanding shares with a current market price of         per share  This investment is new information and it is independent of other  expectations about the company  What should be the effect of the project on  the value of the company and the stock price 
6,74,Solution 
7,74,The NPV of the project is      million        million        million  The total  market value of the company prior to the investment is                million  shares         million  The value of the company should increase by      million  to        million  The price per share should increase by the NPV per share  or       million      million shares         per share  The share price should  increase from        to        
8,74,The effect of a capital budgeting project s positive or negative NPV on share price  is more complicated than Example   above in which the value of the stock increased  by the project s NPV  The value of a company is the value of its existing investments  plus the net present values of all of its future investments   If an analyst learns of an  investment  the impact of that investment on the stock price will depend on whether  the investment s profitability is more or less than expected  For example an analyst  could learn of a positive NPV project  but if the project s profitability is less than  expectations  this stock might drop in price on the news   Alternatively news of a  particular capital project might be considered as a signal about other capital projects  underway or in the future  A project that by itself might add say       to the value of  the stock might signal the existence of other profitable projects   News of this project  might increase the stock price by far more than        The integrity of a corporation s capital budgeting processes is important to ana  lysts   Management s capital budgeting processes can demonstrate two things about  the quality of management   the degree to which management embraces the goal of  shareholder wealth maximization and its effectiveness in pursuing that goal  Both of  these factors are important to shareholders  
9,74,SUMMARY
10,74,Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital  projects those projects with a life of a year or more  This reading developed the  principles behind the basic capital budgeting model the cash flows that go into the  model and several extensions of the basic model     Capital budgeting undergirds the most critical investments for many corpora  tions their investments in long  term assets   The principles of capital budget  ing have been applied to other corporate investing and financing decisions and  to security analysis and portfolio management      The typical steps in the capital budgeting process are     generating ideas      analyzing individual proposals     planning the capital budget  and    monitor  ing and post  auditing  
1,75,Summary
2,75,  
3,75,   Projects susceptible to capital budgeting process can be categorized as       replacement     expansion    new products and services  and    regulatory  safety and environmental     Capital budgeting decisions are based on incremental after  tax cash flows dis  counted at the opportunity cost of funds   Financing costs are ignored because  both the cost of debt and the cost of other capital are captured in the discount  rate     The net present value  NPV   is the present value of all after  tax cash flows  or

27,75,   The payback period is the number of years required to recover the original  investment in a project   The payback is based on cash flows      The discounted payback period is the number of years it takes for the cumula  tive discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment      The average accounting rate of return  AAR  can be defined as follows

5,83,INTRODUCTION
6,83,A company grows by making investments that are expected to increase revenues and  profits   The company acquires the capital or funds necessary to make such investments  by borrowing or using funds from owners   By applying this capital to investments  with long  term benefits  the company is producing value today  But how much value   The answer depends not only on the investments  expected future cash flows but also  on the cost of the funds   Borrowing is not costless   Neither is using owners  funds   The cost of this capital is an important ingredient in both investment decision  making by the company  s management and the valuation of the company by investors    If a company invests in projects that produce a return in excess of the cost of capital  the company has created value  in contrast  if the company invests in projects whose  returns are less than the cost of capital the company has actually destroyed value   Therefore the estimation of the cost of capital is a central issue in corporate financial  management   For the analyst seeking to evaluate a company  s investment program  and its competitive position an accurate estimate of a company  s cost of capital is  important as well  Cost of capital estimation is a challenging task   As we have already implied the  cost of capital is not observable but  rather must be estimated  Arriving at a cost of  capital estimate requires a host of assumptions and estimates   Another challenge is  that the cost of capital that is appropriately applied to a specific investment depends  on the characteristics of that investment   The riskier the investment s cash flows  the  greater its cost of capital  In reality a company must estimate project  specific costs of  capital  What is often done however is to estimate the cost of capital for the company  as a whole and then adjust this overall corporate cost of capital upward or downward  to reflect the risk of the contemplated project relative to the company  s average project  This reading is organized as follows   In the next section we introduce the cost  of capital and its basic computation  Section   presents a selection of methods for  estimating the costs of the various sources of capital  Section   discusses issues an  analyst faces in using the cost of capital  A summary concludes the reading  
7,83,COST OF CAPITAL
8,83,The cost of capital is the rate of return that the suppliers of capital bondholders  and owners require as compensation for their contribution of capital  Another  way of looking at the cost of capital is that it is the opportunity cost of funds for the  suppliers of capital  A potential supplier of capital will not voluntarily invest in a  company unless its return meets or exceeds what the supplier could earn elsewhere  in an investment of comparable risk   A company typically has several alternatives for raising capital including issuing  equity debt and instruments that share characteristics of debt and equity  Each source  selected becomes a component of the company  s funding and has a cost  required rate  of return  that may be called a component cost of capital  Because we are using the  cost of capital in the evaluation of investment opportunities  we are dealing with a  marginal cost what it would cost to raise additional funds for the potential invest  ment project   Therefore the cost of capital that the investment analyst is concerned  with is a marginal cost   Let us focus on the cost of capital for the entire company  later we will address how  to adjust that for specific projects   The cost of capital of a company is the required  rate of return that investors demand for the average  risk investment of a company   The most common way to estimate this required rate of return is to calculate the
1,84,Cost of Capital
2,84,  
3,84,marginal cost of each of the various sources of capital and then calculate a weighted  average of these costs   This weighted average is referred to as the weighted average  cost of capital  WACC   The WACC is also referred to as the marginal cost of capital   MCC  because it is the cost that a company incurs for additional capital  The weights  in this weighted average are the proportions of the various sources of capital that the  company uses to support its investment program  Therefore the WACC  in its most  general terms  is WACC   wdrd     t    wprp   were   where  wd   the proportion of debt that the company uses when it raises new funds rd   the before  tax marginal cost of debt t   the company  s marginal tax rate  wp   the proportion of preferred stock the company uses when it raises new  funds rp   the marginal cost of preferred stock we   the proportion of equity that the company uses when it raises new funds re   the marginal cost of equity

5,84,EXAMPLE  
6,84,Computing the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
7,84,Assume that ABC Corporation has the following capital structure     percent  debt    percent preferred stock  and    percent equity  ABC Corporation wishes  to maintain these proportions as it raises new funds   Its before  tax cost of debt  is    percent  its cost of preferred stock is     percent  and its cost of equity is      percent   If the company  s marginal tax rate is     percent  what is ABC  s  weighted average cost of capital 
8,84,Solution 
9,84,The weighted average cost of capital is  WACC                                                             percent
10,84,There are important points concerning the calculation of the WACC as shown in  Equation   that the analyst must be familiar with  The next two sections address two  key issues   taxes and the selection of weights  
11,84,    Taxes and the Cost of Capital
12,84,Notice that in Equation   we adjust the expected before  tax cost on new debt financ  ing  rd by a factor of      t   In the United States and many other tax jurisdictions   the interest on debt financing is a deduction to arrive at taxable income  Taking the  tax  deductibility of interest as the base case we adjust the pre  tax cost of debt for this  tax shield  Multiplying rd by      t  results in an estimate of the after  tax cost of debt   For example suppose a company pays    million in interest on its     million of  debt   The cost of this debt is not    million because this interest expense reduces tax  able income by    million resulting in a lower tax   If the company is subject to a tax  rate of    percent  this    million of interest costs the company     million           
1,85,  
2,85,Reading      Cost of Capital
3,85,       million because the interest reduces the company  s tax bill by      million  In  this case the before  tax cost of debt is    percent  whereas the after  tax cost of debt  is       million       million      percent   Estimating the cost of common equity capital is more challenging than estimating  the cost of debt capital  Debt capital involves a stated legal obligation on the part of  the company to pay interest and repay the principal on the borrowing   Equity entails  no such obligation  Estimating the cost of conventional preferred equity is rather  straightforward because the dividend is generally stated and fixed but estimating  the cost of common equity is challenging   There are several methods available for  estimating the cost of common equity and we discuss two in this reading   The first  method uses the capital asset pricing model and the second method uses the dividend  discount model which is based on discounted cash flows   No matter the method  there is no need to make any adjustment in the cost of equity for taxes because the  payments to owners  whether in the form of dividends or the return on capital are  not tax  deductible for the company

12,85,    Weights of the Weighted Average
13,85,How do we determine what weights to use  Ideally we want to use the proportion of  each source of capital that the company would use in the project or company  If we  assume that a company has a target capital structure and raises capital consistent with  this target  we should use this target capital structure  The target capital structure is  the capital structure that a company is striving to obtain  If we know the company  s  target capital structure then of course we should use this in our analysis   Someone  outside the company however such as an analyst  typically does not know the target  capital structure and must estimate it using one of several approaches     Assume the company  s current capital structure at market value weights for the  components  represents the company  s target capital structure    Examine trends in the company  s capital structure or statements by manage  ment regarding capital structure policy to infer the target capital structure    Use averages of comparable companies  capital structures as the target capital  structure

2,86,  
3,86,In the absence of knowledge of a company  s target capital structure we may take  Method   as the baseline  Note that in applying Method   we use an unweighted  arithmetic average as is often done for simplicity  An alternative is to calculate a  weighted average which would give more weight to larger companies   Suppose we are using the company  s current capital structure as a proxy for the  target capital structure  In this case we use the market value of the different capital  sources in the calculation of these proportions   For example if a company has the  following market values for its capital
4,86,Bonds outstanding Preferred stock Common stock Total capital

63,87,    Applying the Cost of Capital to Capital Budgeting and  Security Valuation
64,87,With some insight now into the calculation of the cost of capital let us continue to  improve our understanding of the roles it plays in financial analysis   A chief use of the  marginal cost of capital estimate is in capital  budgeting decision making   What role  does the marginal cost of capital play in a company  s investment program and how  do we adapt it when we need to evaluate a specific investment project  A company  s marginal cost of capital  MCC  may increase as additional capital  is raised whereas returns to a company  s investment opportunities are generally  believed to decrease as the company makes additional investments  as represented  by the investment opportunity schedule  IOS    We show this relation in Figure    graphing the upward  sloping marginal cost of capital schedule against the downward   sloping investment opportunity schedule  In the context of a company  s investment  decision the optimal capital budget is that amount of capital raised and invested at  which the marginal cost of capital is equal to the marginal return from investing   In  other words  the optimal capital budget occurs when the marginal cost of capital  intersects with the investment opportunity schedule as seen in Figure    The relation between the MCC and the IOS provides a broad picture of the basic  decision  making problem of a company  However we are often interested in valuing  an individual project or even a portion of a company such as a division or product  line  In these applications  we are interested in the cost of capital for the project   product  or division as opposed to the cost of capital for the company overall  The
65,87,  These weights represent the arithmetic average of the three companies  debt proportion and equity  proportion respectively    The investment opportunity schedule originates with Fisher  s production opportunities  Irving Fisher  The Theory of Interest  New York   MacMillan Co         and was adapted to capital budgeting by John  Hirshleifer   On the Theory of Optimal Investment Decision  Journal of Political Economy Vol     No      August       pp           
1,88,Cost of Capital
2,88,  
3,88,cost of capital in these applications should reflect the riskiness of the future cash flows  of the project  product  or division  For an average  risk project  the opportunity cost  of capital is the company  s WACC   If the systematic risk of the project is above or  below average relative to the company  s current portfolio of projects  an upward or  downward adjustment respectively is made to the company  s WACC   Companies may  take an ad hoc or a systematic approach to making such adjustments   The discussion  of a systematic approach is a somewhat advanced topic that we defer to Section

11,88,The WACC or MCC corresponding to the average risk of the company adjusted  appropriately for the risk of a given project  plays a role in capital  budgeting decision  making based on the net present value  NPV   of that project  Recall from the reading  on capital budgeting that the NPV is the present value of all the project cash flows   It  is useful to think of it as the difference between the present value of the cash inflows   discounted at the opportunity cost of capital applicable to the specific project  and  the present value of the cash outflows  discounted using that same opportunity cost  of capital  NPV   Present value of inflows   Present value of outflows If an investment s NPV is positive the company should undertake the project   If we  choose to use the company  s WACC in the calculation of the NPV of a project  we  are assuming that the project      has the same risk as the average  risk project of the company and    will have a constant target capital structure throughout its useful life   These may not be realistic or appropriate assumptions and are potential drawbacks  to using the company  s WACC in valuing projects   However alternative approaches  are subject to drawbacks as well and the approach outlined has wide acceptance  
12,88,  WACC is estimated using fixed proportions of equity and debt   The NPV method assumes a constant  required rate of return whereas a fluctuating capital structure would cause WACC to fluctuate  The impor  tance of this issue is demonstrated by James A   Miles and John R   Ezzell  The Weighted Average Cost of  Capital Perfect Capital Markets  and Project Life  A Clarification  Journal of Financial and Quantitative  Analysis Vol     No     September       pp             See the reading on capital budgeting for a discussion

2,89,Reading      Cost of Capital
3,89,For the analyst  the second key use of the marginal cost of capital is in security  valuation using any one of several discounted cash flow valuation models available    For a particular valuation model if these cash flows are cash flows to the company  s  suppliers of capital  that is  free cash flow to the firm  the analyst uses the weighted  average cost of capital of the company in the valuation   If these cash flows are strictly  those belonging to the company  s owners  such as the free cash flow to equity or divi  dends  the analyst uses the cost of equity capital to find the present value of these flows    In the next section we discuss how an analyst may approach the calculation of the  component costs of capital focusing on debt  preferred stock  and common equity 
4,89, 
5,89,COSTS OF THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF CAPITAL
6,89,Each source of capital has a different cost because of the differences among the sources   such as seniority contractual commitments  and potential value as a tax shield  We  focus on the costs of three primary sources of capital  debt  preferred equity and  common equity 
7,89,    Cost of Debt
8,89,The cost of debt is the cost of debt financing to a company when it issues a bond  or takes out a bank loan  We discuss two methods to estimate the before  tax cost of  debt  rd  the yield  to  maturity approach and debt  rating approach 
9,89,      Yield  to  Maturity Approach
10,89,The yield to maturity  YTM  is the annual return that an investor earns on a bond  if the investor purchases the bond today and holds it until maturity  In other words   it is the yield rd that equates the present value of the bond s promised payments to  its market price

39,90,      Debt  Rating Approach
40,90,When a reliable current market price for a company  s debt is not available the debt   rating approach can be used to estimate the before  tax cost of debt   Based on a  company  s debt rating  we estimate the before  tax cost of debt by using the yield  on comparably rated bonds for maturities that closely match that of the company  s  existing debt   Suppose a company  s capital structure includes debt with an average maturity   or duration  of    years and the company  s marginal tax rate is     percent   If the  company  s rating is AAA and the yield on debt with the same debt rating and similar  maturity is   percent  the company  s after  tax cost of debt is rd     t      percent                 percent A consideration when using this approach is that debt ratings are ratings of the debt  issue itself with the issuer being only one of the considerations   Other factors  such  as debt seniority and security also affect ratings and yields  so care must be taken  to consider the likely type of debt to be issued by the company in determining the  comparable debt rating and yield  The debt  rating approach is a simple example of  pricing on the basis of valuation  relevant characteristics  which in bond markets has  been known as evaluated pricing or matrix pricing 
41,90,  rd is expressed as an annual rate and is divided by the number of payment periods per year  Because most  corporate bonds pay semi  annual interest  we divided rd by   in this calculation  The interest payment for  each period thus corresponds with the bond s semi  annual coupon payment

3,91,      Issues in Estimating the Cost of Debt         Fixed  Rate Debt versus Floating  Rate Debt  Up to now we have assumed
4,91,that the interest on debt is a fixed amount each period  We can observe market yields  of the company  s existing debt or market yields of debt of similar risk in estimating  the before  tax cost of debt  However the company may also issue floating  rate debt  in which the interest rate adjusts periodically according to a prescribed index such as  the prime rate or Libor over the life of the instrument  Estimating the cost of a floating  rate security is difficult because the cost of this  form of capital over the long term depends not only on the current yields but also on  the future yields   The analyst may use the current term structure of interest rates and  term structure theory to assign an average cost to such instruments           Debt with Optionlike Features How should an analyst determine the cost of  debt when the company used debt with optionlike features such as call conversion or  put provisions  Clearly options affect the value of debt  For example a callable bond  would have a yield greater than a similar noncallable bond of the same issuer because  bondholders want to be compensated for the call risk associated with the bond  In a  similar manner the put feature of a bond which provides the investor with an option  to sell the bond back to the issuer at a predetermined price has the effect of lowering  the yield on a bond below that of a similar nonputable bond  If the company already has debt outstanding incorporating optionlike features that  the analyst believes are representative of the future debt issuance of the company the  analyst may simply use the yield to maturity on such debt in estimating the cost of debt  If the analyst believes that the company will add or remove option features in  future debt issuance the analyst can make market value adjustments to the current  YTM to reflect the value of such additions and or deletions   The technology for such  adjustments is an advanced topic that is outside the scope of this reading   If a company does not have any debt outstanding or if the  yields on the company  s existing debt are not available the analyst may not always be  able to use the yield on similarly rated debt securities   It may be the case that the com  pany does not have rated bonds   Though researchers offer approaches for estimating a  company  s  synthetic  debt rating based on financial ratios these methods are imprecise  because debt ratings incorporate not only financial ratios but also information about  the particular bond issue and the issuer that are not captured in financial ratios           Leases A lease is a contractual obligation that can substitute for other forms  of borrowing   This is true whether the lease is an operating lease or a capital lease   finance lease   If the company uses leasing as a source of capital the cost of these  leases should be included in the cost of capital  The cost of this form of borrowing is  similar to that of the company  s other long  term borrowing

11,92,Therefore the cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock s dividend per share  divided by the current preferred stock s price per share  Unlike interest on debt  the  dividend on preferred stock is not tax  deductible by the company   therefore there is  no adjustment to the cost for taxes    A preferred stock may have a number of features that affect the yield and hence  the cost of preferred stock   These features include a call option cumulative dividends   participating dividends  adjustable  rate dividends  or convertibility into common  stock   When estimating a yield based on current yields of the company  s preferred  stock  we must make appropriate adjustments for the effects of these features on the  yield of an issue  For example if the company has callable convertible preferred stock  outstanding  yet it is expected that the company will issue only noncallable noncon  vertible preferred stock in the future we would have to either use the current yields  on comparable companies  noncallable nonconvertible preferred stock or estimate  the yield on preferred equity using methods outside the scope of this reading

4,93,Solution 
5,93,If De Gouden Tulip were to issue new preferred stock today the coupon rate  would be close to     percent  The current terms thus prevail over the past terms  when evaluating the actual cost of preferred stock   The cost of preferred stock  for De Gouden Tulip is  therefore     percent  Because preferred dividends offer  no tax shield there is no adjustment made based upon the marginal tax rate 
6,93,    Cost of Common Equity
7,93,The cost of common equity  re  usually referred to simply as the cost of equity is the  rate of return required by a company  s common shareholders   A company may increase  common equity through the reinvestment of earnings that is  retained earnings or  through the issuance of new shares of stock   As we discussed earlier the estimation of the cost of equity is challenging because  of the uncertain nature of the future cash flows in terms of the amount and timing    Commonly used approaches for estimating the cost of equity include the capital asset  pricing model the dividend discount model and the bond yield plus risk premium  method 
8,93,      Capital Asset Pricing Model Approach
9,93,In the capital asset pricing model  CAPM  approach we use the basic relationship  from the capital asset pricing model theory that the expected return on a stock  E Ri   is the sum of the risk  free rate of interest  RF and a premium for bearing the stock s  market risk   i RM   RF

26,94,The historical equity risk premium approach is a well  established approach
27,94,based on the assumption that the realized equity risk premium observed over a long  period of time is a good indicator of the expected equity risk premium  This approach  requires compiling historical data to find the average rate of return of a country  s mar  ket portfolio and the average rate of return for the risk  free rate in that country  For  example an analyst might use the historical returns to the TOPIX Index to estimate  the risk premium for Japanese equities   The exceptional bull market observed during  the second half of the     s  and the bursting of the technology bubble that followed  during the years           reminds us that the time period for such estimates should  cover complete market cycles   Elroy Dimson Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton conducted an analysis of the equity  risk premiums observed in markets located in    countries  including the United  States  over the period              These researchers found that the annualized US  equity risk premium relative to US Treasury bills was     percent  geometric mean   and      percent  arithmetic mean   They also found that the annualized US equity  risk premium relative to bonds was      percent  geometric mean  and      percent

3,96,The historical premium approach has several limitations   One limitation is that  the level of risk of the stock index may change over time  Another is that the risk  aversion of investors may change over time  And still another limitation is that the  estimates are sensitive to the method of estimation and the historical period covered

21,96,A second approach for estimating the equity risk premium is the dividend discount  model based approach or implied risk premium approach which is implemented  using the Gordon growth model  also known as the constant  growth dividend discount  model   For developed markets  corporate earnings often meet at least approximately  the model s assumption of a long  run trend growth rate  We extract the premium by  analyzing how the market prices an index   That is  we use the relationship between the  value of an index and expected dividends  assuming a constant growth in dividends

39,96,Therefore the expected return on the market is the sum of the dividend yield and the  growth rate in dividends     The equity risk premium thus is the difference between  the expected return on the equity market and the risk  free rate  Suppose the expected dividend yield on an equity index is    percent and the  expected growth rate of dividends on the index is   percent   The expected return on  the market according to the Gordon growth model is E Rm      percent     percent     percent A risk  free rate of interest of     percent implies an equity risk premium of   percent        percent       percent

3,97,Another approach to estimate the equity risk premium is quite direct   Ask a panel  of finance experts for their estimates and take the mean response  This is the survey  approach  For example one set of US surveys found that the expected US equity risk  premium over the next    years was     percent to   percent forecasting from       as the baseline year and     percent using      as the baseline year  Once we have an estimate of the equity risk premium we fine  tune this estimate  for the particular company or project by adjusting it for the specific systematic risk  of the project   We adjust for the specific systematic risk by multiplying the market  risk premium by beta to arrive at the company  s or project s risk premium which we  then add to the risk  free rate to determine the cost of equity within the framework  of the CAPM   
4,97,      Dividend Discount Model Approach
5,97,Earlier we used the Gordon growth model to develop an estimate of the equity risk  premium for use in the CAPM  We can also use the Gordon growth model directly  to obtain an estimate of the cost of equity  To review the dividend discount model  in general states that the intrinsic value of a share of stock is the present value of the  share s expected future dividends

5,98,      Bond Yield plus Risk Premium Approach
6,98,The bond yield plus risk premium approach is based on the fundamental tenet in  financial theory that the cost of capital of riskier cash flows is higher than that of less  risky cash flows   In this approach we sum the before  tax cost of debt  rd and a risk  premium that captures the additional yield on a company  s stock relative to its bonds    The estimate is  therefore re   rd   Risk premium The risk premium compensates for the additional risk of equity compared with  debt     Ideally this risk premium is forward looking  representing the additional risk  associated with the stock of the company as compared with the bonds of the same  company  However we often estimate this premium using historical spreads between  bond yields and stock yields   In developed country markets  a typical risk premium  added is in the range of   to   percent   Looking again at Citigroup as of early January      the yield to maturity of the  Citigroup    s bonds maturing in      was approximately       percent   Adding an  arbitrary risk premium of      percent produces an estimate of the cost of equity  of                      percent   This estimate contrasts with the higher estimates of         percent  under the CAPM approach and        percent  under the dividend  discount model approach  Such disparities are not uncommon and reflect the difficulty  of cost of equity estimation

8,98,TOPICS IN COST OF CAPITAL ESTIMATION
9,98,When calculating a company  s weighted average cost of capital  WACC  it is essential  to understand the risk factors that have been considered in determining the risk  free  rate the equity risk premium and beta to ensure a consistent calculation of WACC  and avoid the double counting or omission of pertinent risk factors  
10,98, 
11,98,   This risk premium is not to be confused with the equity risk premium  The equity risk premium is the  difference between the cost of equity and the risk  free rate of interest  The risk premium in the bond yield  plus risk premium approach is the difference between the cost of equity and the company s cost of debt

4,99,When the analyst uses the CAPM to estimate the cost of equity he or she must estimate  beta   The estimation of beta presents many choices as well as challenges   One common method of estimating the company  s stock beta is to use a market  model regression of the company  s stock returns  Ri  against market returns  Rm   over T periods

15,99,where a  is the estimated intercept and b  is the estimated slope of the regression that  is used as an estimate of beta   However beta estimates are sensitive to the method of  estimation and data used  Consider some of the issues      Estimation period  The estimated beta is sensitive to the length of the estima  tion period with beta commonly estimated using data over two to nine years    Selection of the estimation period is a trade  off between data richness captured  by longer estimation periods and company  specific changes that are better  reflected with shorter estimation periods   In general longer estimation periods  are applied to companies with a long and stable operating history and shorter  estimation periods are used for companies that have undergone significant  structural changes in the recent past  such as restructuring  recent acquisition  or divestiture  or changes in financial and operating leverage     Periodicity of the return interval  e g   daily weekly or monthly   Researchers  have observed smaller standard error in beta estimated using smaller return  intervals  such as daily returns        Selection of an appropriate market index  The choice of market index affects the  estimate of beta      Use of a smoothing technique  Some analysts adjust historical betas to reflect the  tendency of betas to revert to      As an example the expression  iadj                  i adjusts betas above and below     toward         Adjustments for small  capitalization stocks  Small  capitalization stocks have  generally exhibited greater risks and greater returns than large  capitalization  stocks over the long run  Roger Ibbotson Paul Kaplan and James Peterson  argue that betas for small  capitalization companies be adjusted upward    Arriving at an estimated beta for publicly traded companies is generally not a  problem because of the accessibility of stock return data  the ease of use of estimating  beta using simple regression and the availability of estimated betas on publicly traded  companies from financial analysis vendors  such as Barra  Bloomberg  Thompson  Financial s Datastream Reuters  and Value Line  The challenge is to estimate a beta  for a company that is not publicly traded or to estimate a beta for a project that is  not the average or typical project of a publicly traded company  Estimating a beta in  these cases requires proxying for the beta by using the information on the project or  company combined with a beta of a publicly traded company

3,100,The beta of a company or project is affected by the systematic components of  business risk and by financial risk   Both of these factors affect the uncertainty of the  cash flows of the company or project  The business risk of a company or project is the  risk related to the uncertainty of revenues  referred to as sales risk and to operating  risk which is the risk attributed to the company  s operating cost structure  Sales risk  is affected by the elasticity of the demand of the product  the cyclicality of the reve  nues  and the structure of competition in the industry  Operating risk is affected by  the relative mix of fixed and variable operating costs   the greater the fixed operating  costs  relative to variable operating costs  the greater the uncertainty of income and  cash flows from operations   Financial risk is the uncertainty of net income and net cash flows attributed to  the use of financing that has a fixed cost  such as debt and leases   The greater the  use of fixed  financing sources of capital relative to variable sources  the greater the  financial risk   In other words  a company that relies heavily on debt financing instead  of equity financing is assuming a great deal of financial risk   How does a financial analyst estimate a beta for a company or project that is not  publicly traded  One common method is the pure  play method which requires using  a comparable publicly traded company  s beta and adjusting it for financial leverage  differences   A comparable company is a company that has similar business risk   The reason  it is referred to as the pure  play method is that one of the easiest ways of identifying  a comparable for a project is to find a company in the same industry that is in that  single line of business   For example if the analyst is examining a project that involves  drug stores  appropriate comparables in the United States may be Walgreens  CVS  Corporation and Rite Aid Corporation  In estimating a beta in this way the analyst must make adjustments to account  for differing degrees of financial leverage  This requires a process of  unlevering   and  levering  the beta   The beta of the comparable is first  unlevered  by removing  the effects of its financial leverage    The unlevered beta is often referred to as the  asset beta because it reflects the business risk of the assets   Once we determine the  unlevered beta  we adjust it for the capital structure of the company or project that  is the focus of our analysis   In other words  we  lever  the asset beta to arrive at an  estimate of the equity beta for the project or company of interest   For a given company we can unlever its equity beta to estimate its asset beta   To  do this  we must determine the relationship between a company  s asset beta and its  equity beta   Because the company  s risk is shared between creditors and owners  we  can represent the company  s risk   asset as the weighted average of the company  s  creditors  market risk   debt and the market risk of the owners   equity

26,105,    Country Risk
27,105,The use of a stock s beta to capture the country risks of a project is well supported in  empirical studies that examine developed nations   However beta does not appear to  adequately capture country risk for companies in developing nations     A common  approach for dealing with this problem is to adjust the cost of equity estimated using  the CAPM by adding a country spread to the market risk premium    The country  spread is also referred to as a country risk premium  Perhaps the simplest estimate of the country spread is the sovereign yield spread  which is the difference between the government bond yield in that country denomi  nated in the currency of a developed country and the Treasury bond yield on a similar  maturity bond in the developed country    However this approach may be too coarse  for the purposes of risk premium estimation 
28,105,   Campbell R   Harvey  The International Cost of Capital and Risk Calculator  Duke University working  paper   July           Adding the country spread to the market risk premium for a developing country and then multiplying  this sum by the market risk of the project is making the assumption that the country risk premium varies  according to market risk   An alternative method calculates the cost of equity as the sum of three terms       the risk  free rate of interest     the product of the beta and the developed market risk premium and    the  country risk premium  This latter method assumes that the country risk premium is the same regardless  of the project s market risk      Jorge O  Mariscal and Rafaelina M  Lee  The Valuation of Mexican Stocks   An Extension of the Capital  Asset Pricing Model  New York   Goldman Sachs        
1,106,Topics in Cost of Capital Estimation
2,106,   
3,106,Another approach is to calculate the country risk premium as the product of the  sovereign yield spread and the ratio of the volatility of the developing country equity  market to that of the sovereign bond market denominated in terms of the currency  of a developed country

9,106,    
10,106,The logic of this calculation is that the sovereign yield spread captures the general  risk of the country which is then adjusted for the volatility of the stock market relative  to the bond market   This country risk premium is then used in addition to the equity  premium estimated for a project in a developed country  Therefore if the equity risk  premium for a project in a developed country is      percent and the country risk  premium is   percent  the total equity risk premium used in the CAPM estimation is      percent   If the appropriate beta is     and the risk  free rate of interest is   percent   the cost of equity is Cost of equity                                   or    percent

3,107,    Marginal Cost of Capital Schedule
4,107,As we noted in Section     as a company raises more funds  the costs of the different  sources of capital may change resulting in a change in the weighted average cost of  capital for different levels of financing   The result is the marginal cost of capital  MCC   schedule which we often depict in graphical form as the weighted average cost of  capital for different amounts of capital raised as we showed earlier in Figure      Why would the cost of capital change as more capital is raised  One source of a  difference in cost depending on the amount of capital raised is that a company may  have existing debt with a bond covenant that restricts the company from issuing  debt with similar seniority as existing debt   Or a debt incurrence test may restrict a  company  s ability to incur additional debt at the same seniority based on one or more  financial tests or conditions   For example if a company issues senior debt such that  any additional debt at that seniority violates the debt incurrence test of an existing  bond covenant  the company may have to issue less senior debt or even equity which  would have a higher cost   Another source of increasing marginal costs of capital is a deviation from the  target capital structure  In the ideal theoretical world a company has a target capital  structure and goes to the market each period and raises capital in these proportions    However as a practical matter companies do not necessarily tap the market in these  ideal proportions because of considerations for economies of scale in raising new cap  ital and market conditions   Because of such perceived economies of scale companies  tend to issue new securities such that in any given period it may deviate from the  proportions dictated by any target or optimal capital structure  In other words  these  short  run deviations are due to the  lumpiness  of security issuance  As the company  experiences deviations from the target capital structure the marginal cost of capital  may increase reflecting these deviations   The amount of capital at which the weighted average cost of capital changes  which means that the cost of one of the sources of capital changes is referred to as a  break point  The reality of raising capital is that the marginal cost of capital schedule  is not as smooth as we depicted in Figure   but  rather is a step  up cost schedule as  shown in Figure   
5,107,   Later in this section we will discuss cases where a company  s WACC may actually decrease as addi  tional capital is raised  For example if a company financed solely with common equity raises additional  capital via debt  then the tax advantages provided by debt will result in a lower WACC under the new  capital structure  For this discussion we are assuming that the company is already operating at or near its  optimum balance of debt versus equity

16,110,    Flotation Costs
17,110,When a company raises new capital it generally seeks the assistance of investment  bankers   Investment bankers charge the company a fee based on the size and type of  offering   This fee is referred to as the flotation cost  In the case of debt and preferred  stock  we do not usually incorporate flotation costs in the estimated cost of capital  because the amount of these costs is quite small often less than   percent     However with equity issuance the flotation costs may be substantial so we should  consider these when estimating the cost of external equity capital  For example Inmoo  Lee Scott Lochhead Jay Ritter and Quanshui Zhao observe average flotation costs for  new equity in the United States of      percent     The flotation costs in other coun  tries differ from the US experience  Thomas B hner and Christoph Kaserer observe  flotation costs around      percent in Germany Seth Armitage estimates an average  issuance cost of       percent in the United Kingdom and Christoph Kaserer and  Fabian Steiner observe an average cost of      for Swiss capital offerings     A large  part of the differences in costs among these studies is likely attributed to the type of  offering  cash underwritten offers  typical in the United States  are generally more  expensive than rights offerings  which are common in Europe  Should we incorporate flotation costs into the cost of capital  There are two views  on this topic  One view which you can find often in textbooks  is to incorporate the  flotation costs into the cost of capital  The other view is that flotation costs should not  be included in the cost of capital but  rather incorporated into any valuation analysis  as an additional cost of the project  
18,110,   We can incorporate them for these sources by simply treating the flotation costs as an outlay hence  reducing proceeds from the source     Inmoo Lee Scott Lochhead Jay R   Ritter and Quanshui Zhao  The Costs of Raising Capital  Journal  of Financial Research Vol      Spring        pp            Thomas B hner and Christoph Kaserer  External Financing Costs and Economies of Scale in Investment  Banking  The Case of Seasoned Equity Offerings in Germany  European Financial Management Vol       June       pp       Seth Armitage  The Direct Costs of UK Rights Issues and Open Offers   European  Financial Management Vol           pp         Christoph Kaserer and Fabian Steiner  The Cost of Raising  Capital New Evidence from Seasoned Equity Offerings in Switzerland  Technische Universit t M nchen  working paper  February

62,111,The problem with this approach is that the flotation costs are a cash flow at the  initiation of the project and affect the value of any project by reducing the initial cash  flow  Adjusting the cost of capital for flotation costs is incorrect because by doing so  we are adjusting the present value of the future cash flows by a fixed percentage in  the above example a difference of    basis points  which does not necessarily equate  to the present value of the flotation costs     The alternative and recommended approach is to make the adjustment to the cash  flows in the valuation computation  For example consider a project that requires a         initial cash outlay and is expected to produce cash flows of        each  year for    years   Suppose the company  s marginal tax rate is     percent and that  the before  tax cost of debt is    percent   Furthermore suppose that the company  s  dividend next period is    the current price of the stock is     and the expected  growth rate is   percent so that the cost of equity using the dividend discount model  is                        or    percent   Assume the company will finance the project  with    percent debt and    percent equity  Table   summarizes the information on  the component costs of capital

3,112,The weighted average cost of capital is      percent calculated as         percent             percent   Ignoring flotation costs for the moment the net present value  NPV    of this project is NPV                           If the flotation costs are say    percent of the new equity capital the flotation costs  are        The net present value considering flotation costs is NPV                                   If flotation costs are not tax deductible or                                       if flotation costs are tax deductible 
4,112,If instead of considering the flotation costs as part of the cash flows  we adjust the  cost of equity the cost of capital is        percent and the NPV is NPV                           As you can see we arrive at different assessments of value using these two methods   So if it is preferred to deduct the flotation costs as part of the net present value  calculation why do we see the adjustment in the cost of capital so often in textbooks   The first reason is that it is often difficult to identify particular financing associated  with a project   Using the adjustment for the flotation costs in the cost of capital may  be useful if specific project financing cannot be identified  Second by adjusting the  cost of capital for the flotation costs  it is easier to demonstrate how costs of financing  a company change as a company exhausts internally generated equity  i e  retained  earnings  and switches to externally generated equity  i e  a new stock issue

3,113,In a survey of publicly traded multinational European companies  Franck Bancel  and Usha Mittoo provide evidence consistent with the Graham and Harvey survey     They find that over     percent of companies use the CAPM to determine the cost  of equity   this compares with the      percent of US companies that use the CAPM   In a survey of both publicly traded and private European companies  Dirk Brounen  Abe de Jong  and Kees Koedijk confirm the result of Graham and Harvey that larger  companies are more likely to use the more sophisticated methods  such as CAPM in  estimating the cost of equity    Brounen Jong  and Koedijk find that the popularity  of the use of CAPM is less for their sample  ranging from    percent to      percent   depending on the country  than for the other two surveys  which may reflect the  inclusion of smaller private companies in the latter sample  We learn from the survey evidence that the CAPM is a popular method for esti  mating the cost of equity capital and that it is used less by smaller private companies    This latter result is not surprising because of the difficulty in estimating systematic  risk in cases in which the company  s equity is not publicly traded

3,114,   Because interest payments are generally tax  deductible the after  tax cost is the  true effective cost of debt to the company  If a current yield or bond rating is  not available such as in the case of a private company without rated debt or a  project  the estimate of the cost of debt becomes more challenging      The cost of preferred stock is the preferred stock dividend divided by the cur  rent preferred stock price

10,114,   The cost of equity is the rate of return required by a company  s common stock  holders   We estimate this cost using the CAPM  or its variants  or the dividend  discount method     The CAPM is the approach most commonly used to calculate the cost of  common stock   The three components needed to calculate the cost of common  stock are the risk  free rate the equity risk premium and beta

67,114,   It is often the case that country and foreign exchange risk are diversified so  that we can use the estimated   in the CAPM analysis   However in the case  in which these risks cannot be diversified away we can adjust our measure of  systematic risk by a country equity premium to reflect this nondiversified risk

3,115,   In estimating the cost of equity an alternative to the CAPM and dividend  discount approaches is the bond yield plus risk premium approach  In this  approach we estimate the before  tax cost of debt and add a risk premium that  reflects the additional risk associated with the company  s equity     The marginal cost of capital schedule is a graph plotting the new funds raised  by a company on the x axis and the cost of capital on the y axis   The cost of  capital is level to the point at which one of the costs of capital changes  such  as when the company bumps up against a debt covenant  requiring it to use  another form of capital  We calculate a break point using information on when  the different sources  costs change and the proportions that the company uses  when it raises additional capital 
4,115,Break point Amount of capital at which the source s cost o ff capital changes Proportion of new capital raised from thee source
5,115, 
6,115,   Flotation costs are costs incurred in the process of raising additional capital   The preferred method of including these costs in the analysis is as an initial  cash flow in the valuation analysis      Survey evidence tells us that the CAPM method is the most popular method  used by companies in estimating the cost of equity  The CAPM is more popular  with larger publicly traded companies  which is understandable considering the  additional analyses and assumptions required in estimating systematic risk for a  private company or project

10,128,INTRODUCTION
11,128,This reading presents elementary topics in leverage  Leverage is the use of fixed costs  in a company  s cost structure  Fixed costs that are operating costs  such as depreciation  or rent  create operating leverage  Fixed costs that are financial costs  such as interest  expense  create financial leverage  Analysts refer to the use of fixed costs as leverage because fixed costs act as a ful  crum for the company  s earnings   Leverage can magnify earnings both up and down   The profits of highly leveraged companies might soar with small upturns in revenue   But the reverse is also true  Small downturns in revenue may lead to losses   Analysts need to understand a company  s use of leverage for three main reasons    First  the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a company  s risk  and return characteristics   Second analysts may be able to discern information about  a company  s business and future prospects from management s decisions about the use  of operating and financial leverage  Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps  the analyst evaluate the quality of management s decisions   Third the valuation of a

3,129,company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with  those cash flows   Understanding a company  s use of leverage should help in forecasting  cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value  The reading is organized as follows   Section   introduces leverage and defines  important terms   Section   illustrates and discusses measures of operating leverage  and financial leverage which combine to define a measure of total leverage that gauges  the sensitivity of net income to a given percent change in units sold  This section also  covers breakeven points in using leverage and corporate reorganization  a possible  consequence of using leverage inappropriately   A summary and practice problems  conclude this reading

5,129,LEVERAGE
6,129,Leverage increases the volatility of a company  s earnings and cash flows and increases  the risk of lending to or owning a company  Additionally the valuation of a company  and its equity is affected by the degree of leverage  The greater a company  s leverage  the greater its risk and hence the greater the discount rate that should be applied in  its valuation  Further highly leveraged  levered  companies have a greater chance of  incurring significant losses during downturns  thus accelerating conditions that lead  to financial distress and bankruptcy  Consider the simple example of two companies  Impulse Robotics  Inc  and  Malvey Aerospace Inc  These companies have the following performance for the  period of study

14,129,These companies have the same net income but are they identical in terms of  operating and financial characteristics  Would we appraise these two companies at  the same value  Not necessarily  The risk associated with future earnings and cash flows of a company are affected  by the company  s cost structure  The cost structure of a company is the mix of vari  able and fixed costs   Variable costs fluctuate with the level of production and sales    Some examples of variable costs are the cost of goods purchased for resale costs of  materials or supplies  shipping charges  delivery charges  wages for hourly employees   sales commissions  and sales or production bonuses   Fixed costs are expenses that are  the same regardless of the production and sales of the company  These costs include  depreciation rent  interest on debt  insurance and wages for salaried employees  
15,129,  We are ignoring taxes for this example but when taxes are included the general conclusions remain  the same

11,130,The risk associated with these companies is different  although as we saw in  Exhibit   they have the same net income  They have different operating and financing  cost structures  resulting in differing volatility of net income  For example if the number of units produced and sold is different from         the net income of the two companies diverges   If       units are produced and sold  Impulse Robotics has a loss of         and Malvey Aerospace has    earnings   If on  the other hand the number of units produced and sold is        Impulse Robotics  earns    million whereas Malvey Aerospace earns          In other words  the vari  ability in net income is greater for Impulse Robotics  which has higher fixed costs in  terms of both fixed operating costs and fixed financing costs   Impulse Robotics  cost structure results in more leverage than that of Malvey  Aerospace  We can see this effect when we plot the net income of each company  against the number of units produced and sold as in Exhibit    The greater leverage of  Impulse Robotics is reflected in the greater slope of the line representing net income   This means that as the number of units sold changes  Impulse Robotics experiences  a greater change in net income than does Malvey Aerospace for the same change in  units sold

55,131,Companies that have more fixed costs relative to variable costs in their cost struc  tures have greater variation in net income as revenues fluctuate and hence more risk  
56,131,BUSINESS RISK AND FINANCIAL RISK
57,131,Risk arises from both the operating and financing activities of a company  In the  following  we address how that happens and the measures available to the analyst to  gauge the risk in each case 
58,131,    Business Risk and Its Components
59,131,Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings   Operating earnings are  risky because total revenues are risky as are the costs of producing revenues   Revenues  are affected by a large number of factors  including economic conditions  industry  dynamics  including the actions of competitors  government regulation and demo  graphics   Therefore prices of the company  s goods or services or the quantity of sales  may be different from what is expected  We refer to the uncertainty with respect to  the price and quantity of goods and services as sales risk  Operating risk is the risk attributed to the operating cost structure in particular  the use of fixed costs in operations   The greater the fixed operating costs relative to  variable operating costs  the greater the operating risk   Business risk is therefore the  combination of sales risk and operating risk   Companies that operate in the same line  of business generally have similar business risk  
1,132,   
2,132,Business Risk and Financial Risk
3,132,    Sales Risk
4,132,Consider Impulse Robotics once again  Suppose that the forecasted number of units  produced and sold in the next period is        but that the standard deviation of the  number of units sold is        And suppose the price that the units sell for is expected  to be     per unit but the standard deviation is     Contrast this situation with that  of a company named Tolley Aerospace Inc  which has the same cost structure but a  standard deviation of units sold of       and a price standard deviation of     If we assume for simplicity  s sake that the fixed operating costs are known with  certainty and that the units sold and price per unit follow a normal distribution we  can see the impact of the different risks on the operating income of the two companies  through a simulation  the results are shown in Exhibit     Here we see the differing  distributions of operating income that result from the distributions of units sold and  price per unit   So even if the companies have the same cost structure differing sales  risk affects the potential variability of the company  s profitability  In our example  Tolley Aerospace has a wider distribution of likely outcomes in terms of operating  profit   This greater volatility in operating earnings means that Tolley Aerospace has  more sales risk than Impulse Robotics

48,133,The greater the fixed component of costs  the more difficult it is for a company to adjust  its operating costs to changes in sales   The mixture of fixed and variable costs depends  largely on the type of business   Even within the same line of business  companies can  vary their fixed and variable costs to some degree  We refer to the risk arising from  the mix of fixed and variable costs as operating risk  The greater the fixed operating  costs relative to variable operating costs  the greater the operating risk   Next  we look at how operating risk affects the variability of cash flows   A concept  taught in microeconomics is elasticity which is simply a measure of the sensitivity  of changes in one item to changes in another  We can apply this concept to examine  how sensitive a company  s operating income is to changes in demand as measured by  unit sales   We will calculate the operating income elasticity which we refer to as the  degree of operating leverage  DOL   DOL is a quantitative measure of operating  risk as it was defined earlier  The degree of operating leverage is the ratio of the percentage change in operating  income to the percentage change in units sold  We will simplify things and assume  that the company sells all that it produces in the same period  Then

44,134,The per unit contribution margin is the amount that each unit sold contributes  to covering fixed costs that is  the difference between the price per unit and the vari  able cost per unit   That difference multiplied by the quantity sold is the contribution  margin which equals revenue minus variable costs  
45,134,  We provide the variable and fixed operating costs for our sample companies used in this reading to  illustrate the leverage and breakeven concepts   In reality however the financial analyst does not have these  breakdowns but rather is faced with interpreting reported account values that often combine variable and  fixed costs and costs for different product lines

2,135,Reading      Measures of Leverage
3,135,How much does operating income change when the number of units sold changes   Fixed costs do not change  therefore operating income changes by the contribution  margin  The percentage change in operating income for a given change in units sold  simplifies to

8,135,   
9,135,where Q is the number of units  P is the price per unit  V is the variable operating cost  per unit and F is the fixed operating cost  Therefore P   V is the per unit contribution  margin and Q P   V  is the contribution margin  Applying the formula for DOL using the data for Impulse Robotics  we can cal  culate the sensitivity to change in units sold from        units

38,135,We can see the sensitivity of the DOL for different numbers of units produced and  sold in Exhibit    When operating profit is negative the DOL is negative  At positions  just below and just above the point where operating income is    operating income is  at its most sensitive on a percentage basis to changes in units produced and sold  At  the point at which operating income is     at       units produced and sold in this  example  the DOL is undefined because the denominator in the DOL calculation is      After this point  the DOL gradually declines as more units are produced and sold

86,137,This example confirms what we saw earlier in our reasoning of fixed and variable  costs   The greater the use of fixed relative to variable operating costs  the more sen  sitive operating income is to changes in units sold and therefore the more operating  risk   Impulse Robotics has more operating risk because it has more operating leverage   However as Panel B of Exhibit   shows  the degrees of operating leverage are similar  for the two companies for larger numbers of units produced and sold  Both sales risk and operating risk influence a company  s business risk   And both  sales risk and operating risk are determined in large part by the type of business the  company is in  But management has more opportunity to manage and control oper  ating risk than sales risk

19,138,Industries that tend to have high operating leverage are those that invest up front  to produce a product but spend relatively little on making and distributing it  Software  developers and pharmaceutical companies fit this description  Alternatively retailers  have low operating leverage because much of the cost of goods sold is variable  Because most companies produce more than one product  the ratio of variable  to fixed costs is difficult to obtain  We can get an idea of the operating leverage of a  company by looking at changes in operating income in relation to changes in sales for  the entire company  This relation can be estimated by regressing changes in operating  income  the variable to be explained  on changes in sales  the explanatory variable   over a recent time period   Although this approach does not provide a precise mea  sure of operating risk  it can help provide a general idea of the amount of operating  leverage present   For example compare the relation between operating earnings and  revenues for Abbott Laboratories  a pharmaceutical company and Wal  Mart Stores   a discount retailer as shown in Exhibit     Note that the slope of the least  squares  regression line is greater for Abbott  with a slope coefficient of         than for Wal   Mart  with a slope coefficient of           A visual comparison of slopes should not  be relied upon because the scales of the x  and y axes are different in diagrams for the  two regressions    We can see that operating earnings are more sensitive to changes  in revenues for the higher  operating  leveraged Abbott Laboratories as compared to  the lower  operating  leveraged Wal  Mart Stores

28,139,We can expand on the concept of risk to accommodate the perspective of owning a  security  A security represents a claim on the income and assets of a business  therefore  the risk of the security goes beyond the variability of operating earnings to include  how the cash flows from those earnings are distributed among the claimants the  creditors and owners of the business   The risk of a security is therefore affected by  both business risk and financial risk

3,140,Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations    If a company finances with debt  it is legally obligated to pay the amounts that make  up its debts when due  By taking on fixed obligations  such as debt and long  term  leases  the company increases its financial risk   If a company finances its business  with common equity generated either from operations  retained earnings  or from  issuing new common shares  it does not incur fixed obligations   The more fixed  cost  financial obligations  e g   debt  incurred by the company the greater its financial risk   We can quantify this risk in the same way we did for operating risk  looking at the  sensitivity of the cash flows available to owners when operating income changes   This  sensitivity which we refer to as the degree of financial leverage  DFL  is
4,140,DFL
5,140, 
6,140,Percentage change in net income Percentage change in op eerating income
7,140,   
8,140,For example if DFL at a given level of operating income is     a   percent increase  in operating income would be expected to result in a                 percent increase  in net income  A company  s DFL is dependent on the level of operating income being  considered  Net income is equal to operating income less interest and taxes    If operating  income changes  how does net income change  Consider Impulse Robotics   Suppose  the interest payments are         and for simplicity the tax rate is    percent   If  operating income changes from         to         net income changes from          to

28,140,  More complex entities than we have been using for our examples may also need to account for other  income  losses  and extraordinary income  losses  together with operating income as the basis for earnings  before interest and taxes  
1,141,   
2,141,Reading      Measures of Leverage
3,141,Using more debt financing  which results in higher fixed costs  increases the sensi  tivity of net income to changes in operating income  We can represent the sensitivity  of net income to a change in operating income continuing the notation from before  and including the fixed financial cost  C and the tax rate t as

29,141,As you can see in Equation   the factor that adjusts for taxes       t  cancels out  of the equation  In other words  the DFL is not affected by the tax rate  In the case in which operating income is         and fixed financing costs are          the degree of financial leverage is
30,141,DFL    operating income

48,141,         
49,141,Again we need to qualify our degree of leverage by the level of operating income  because DFL is different at different levels of operating income  The greater the use of financing sources that require fixed obligations  such as  interest  the greater the sensitivity of net income to changes in operating income 
50,141,EXAMPLE  
51,141,Calculating the Degree of Financial Leverage
52,141,Global Auto also employs debt financing   If Global can borrow at   percent  the  interest cost is      billion  What is the degree of financial leverage of Global  Auto if   million cars are produced and sold 
53,141,Solution 
54,141,At   million cars produced and sold operating income       billion  Therefore 
55,141,DFL    billion operating income
56,141,

62,141,  
63,141,billion
64,141,       
65,141,For every   percent change in operating income net income changes   percent  due to financial leverage 
66,141,Unlike operating leverage the degree of financial leverage is most often a choice  by the company  s management  Whereas operating costs are very similar among com  panies in the same industry competitors may decide on differing capital structures   Companies with relatively high ratios of tangible assets to total assets may be able  to use higher degrees of financial leverage than companies with relatively low ratios  because the claim on the tangible assets that lenders would have in the event of a  default may make lenders more confident in extending larger amounts of credit   In  general businesses with plants  land and equipment that can be used to collateralize  borrowings and businesses whose revenues have below  average business cycle sensi  tivity may be able to use more financial leverage than businesses without such assets  and with relatively high business cycle sensitivity  Using financial leverage generally increases the variability of return on equity  net  income divided by shareholders  equity   In addition its use by a profitable company  may increase the level of return on equity  Example   illustrates both effects

22,143,Earnings before Interest and Taxes
23,143,Business is generally an uncertain venture  Changes in the macroeconomic and  competitive environments that influence sales and profitability are typically difficult  to discern and forecast   The larger the proportion of debt in the financing mix of a  business  the greater is the chance that it will face default   Similarly the greater the  proportion of debt in the capital structure the more earnings are magnified upward  in improving economic times   The bottom line  Financial leverage tends to increase  the risk of ownership for shareholders  
24,143,    Total Leverage
25,143,The degree of operating leverage gives us an idea of the sensitivity of operating income  to changes in revenues   And the degree of financial leverage gives us an idea of the  sensitivity of net income to changes in operating income  But often we are concerned  about the combined effect of both operating leverage and financial leverage  Owners  are concerned about the combined effect because both factors contribute to the risk  associated with their future cash flows   And financial managers  making decisions  intended to maximize owners  wealth need to be concerned with how investment  decisions  which affect the operating cost structure  and financing decisions  which  affect the capital structure  affect lenders  and owners  risk   Look back at the example of Impulse Robotics   The sensitivity of owners  cash flow  to a given change in units sold is affected by both operating and financial leverage   Consider using        units as the base number produced and sold  A     percent  increase in units sold results in a     percent increase in operating income and a      percent increase in net income  a like decrease in units sold results in a similar  decrease in operating income and net income

46,145,In the case of operating leverage the fixed operating costs act as a fulcrum  The  greater the proportion of operating costs that are fixed the more sensitive operating  income is to changes in sales   In the case of financial leverage the fixed financial costs   such as interest  act as a fulcrum  The greater the proportion of financing with fixed  cost sources  such as debt  the more sensitive cash flows available to owners are to  changes in operating income  Combining the effects of both types of leverage we see  that fixed operating and financial costs together increase the sensitivity of earnings  to owners

27,147,This means that Impulse Robotics must produce and sell more units to achieve a  profit   So while the higher  leveraged Impulse Robotics has a greater breakeven point  relative to Malvey Aerospace the profit that Impulse Robotics generates beyond this  breakeven point is greater than that of Malvey Aerospace  Therefore leverage has its  rewards in terms of potentially greater profit  but it also increases risk   In addition to the breakeven point specified in terms of net income QBE we can  also specify the breakeven point in terms of operating profit  which we refer to as the  operating breakeven point QOBE  Revenues at the operating breakeven point are set  equal to operating costs at the operating breakeven point to solve for the operating  breakeven number of units  QOBE   The expression shows QOBE as equal to fixed oper  ating costs divided by the difference between price per unit and variable cost per unit

36,148,As business expands or contracts beyond or below breakeven points  fixed costs  do not change  The breakeven points for companies with low operating and financial  leverage are less important than those for companies with high leverage  Companies  with greater total leverage must generate more revenue to cover fixed operating and  financing costs   The farther unit sales are from the breakeven point for high  leverage  companies  the greater the magnifying effect of this leverage 
37,148,    The Risks of Creditors and Owners
38,148,As we discussed earlier business risk refers to the effect of economic conditions as  well as the level of operating leverage  Uncertainty about demand output prices  and  costs are among the many factors that affect business risk   When conditions change  for any of these factors  companies with higher business risk experience more volatile  earnings   Financial risk is the additional risk that results from the use of debt and  preferred stock   The degree of financial risk grows with greater use of debt   Who  bears this risk  The risk for providers of equity and debt capital differs because of the relative  rights and responsibilities associated with the use of borrowed money in a business    Lenders have a prior claim on assets relative to shareholders  so they have greater  security  In return for lending money to a business  lenders require the payment of  interest and principal when due  These contractual payments to lenders must be made
1,149,   
2,149,Reading      Measures of Leverage
3,149,regardless of the profitability of the business   A business must satisfy these claims in  a timely fashion or face the pain of bankruptcy should it default   In return for their  higher priority in claims  lenders get predefined yet limited returns   In contrast  equity providers claim whatever is left over after all expenses  includ  ing debt service have been paid  So unlike the fixed and known commitments to the  lenders  what is left over for the owners may be a great deal or may be nothing   In  exchange for this risk  providers of equity capital exercise the decision  making power  over the business  including the right to hire guide and if necessary fire managers   In  public companies  ownership rights are usually exercised through an elected board of  directors   They undertake the decisions over what portion of the business s earnings  should be paid out as dividends for common shareholders   Legal codes in most countries provide for these rights  as well as conditions for  companies to file for bankruptcy  with reference to businesses  often called insol  vency   A number of bankruptcy codes provide in some form for two categories of  bankruptcies   One form provides for a temporary protection from creditors so that  a viable business may reorganize  In the United States  the US Bankruptcy Code sets  the terms for the form of negotiated reorganization of a company  s capital structure  that allows it to remain a going concern in Chapter      For businesses that are not  viable the second form of bankruptcy process allows for the orderly satisfaction of  the creditors  claims   In the United States  this form of bankruptcy is referred to as  liquidation   Whereas both types of bankruptcy lead to major dislocations in the  rights and privileges of owners  lenders  employees  and managers  it is in this latter  category of bankruptcy that the original business ceases to exist   The difference between a company that reorganizes and emerges from bankruptcy  and one that is liquidated is often the difference between operating and financial lever  age  Companies with high operating leverage have less flexibility in making changes   and bankruptcy protection does little to help reduce operating costs   Companies with  high financial leverage use bankruptcy laws and protection to change their capital  structure and once the restructuring is complete can emerge as ongoing concerns

5,149,Chapter    Reorganization and Owens Corning
6,149,The world s largest manufacturer of glass fiber insulation Owens Corning  Corporation of Toledo Ohio filed for Chapter    bankruptcy on   October       as it faced growing asbestos liability claims   With revenues exceeding    billion  per year Owens Corning was one of the largest corporations ever afforded  bankruptcy protection by the US courts   From      to      Owens Corning produced an asbestos  containing high   temperature pipe coating called Kaylo and at the time of its bankruptcy filing  it  had received more than        asbestos personal injury claims and had paid or  agreed to pay more than    billion for asbestos  related awards and settlements   legal expenses  and claims processing fees   While the company had assets of      billion and liabilities of       billion the trust fund it set aside to pay those  claims appeared inadequate

5,150,Chapter   and Webvan Do Not Deliver
6,150,Since the peak of the NASDAQ in March of      many technology companies  have found either that they cannot raise enough capital to implement their  business plans or that they have an untenable business plan  Some have simply  shut their doors and gone out of business  while others have filed for bankruptcy   Either way these companies have left many unsatisfied creditors   For example Webvan com was a start  up company in the late     s that  raised over       billion in equity      million of which came from an IPO in  November       It had very ambitious business plans to build a series of ware  houses and deliver groceries to fulfill customer orders placed over the internet    Webvan com however faced a number of challenges  including a downturn in  the economy and quickly ran through its capital  Webvan com filed for Chapter    bankruptcy protection in July       and  reported that it owed      million to creditors   By the time it began liquidation  under Chapter   in January      it reported that the value of its liquidated assets  totaled only     million leaving its creditors to receive pennies on the dollar  and its investors to receive little or nothing for their      billion investment in  the company 
7,150,Whereas the ability to file for bankruptcy is important to the economy the goal  of most investors is to avoid ownership of companies that are heading toward this  extreme step as well as to be able to evaluate opportunities among companies already  in bankruptcy  Under both Chapter   and Chapter    providers of equity capital gen  erally lose all value during the bankruptcy  On the other hand debtholders typically  receive at least a portion of their capital but the payments of principal and interest  are delayed during the period of bankruptcy protection

10,158,The focus of this reading is on the short  term aspects of corporate finance activities  collectively referred to as working capital management  The goal of effective work  ing capital management is to ensure that a company has adequate ready access to the  funds necessary for day  to  day operating expenses  while at the same time making  sure that the company  s assets are invested in the most productive way  Achieving this  goal requires a balancing of concerns   Insufficient access to cash could ultimately lead

12,159,MANAGING AND MEASURING LIQUIDITY
13,159,Liquidity is the extent to which a company is able to meet its short  term obligations  using assets that can be readily transformed into cash  When we evaluate the liquidity  of an asset  we focus on two dimensions   the type of asset and the speed at which the
1,160,Managing and Measuring Liquidity
2,160,   
3,160,asset can be converted to cash either by sale or financing   Unlike many aspects of  corporate finance corporate liquidity management does not involve a great deal of  theory or generally accepted principles   For companies that have the luxury of large  excesses of cash liquidity is typically taken for granted and the focus is on putting the  excess liquidity to its most productive use  On the other hand when a company faces  tighter financial situations  it is important to have effective liquidity management to  ensure solvency  Unfortunately this recognition comes too late for some companies   with bankruptcy and possible liquidation representing the company  s final choice 
4,160,    Defining Liquidity Management
5,160,Liquidity management refers to the ability of an organization to generate cash when  and where it is needed  Liquidity refers to the resources available for an entity to tap  into cash balances and to convert other assets or extend other liabilities into cash for  use in keeping the entity solvent  i e  being able to pay bills and continue in opera  tion   For the most part  we associate liquidity with short  term assets and liabilities   yet longer  term assets can be converted into cash to provide liquidity  In addition  longer  term liabilities can also be renegotiated to reduce the drain on cash thereby  providing liquidity by preserving the limited supply of cash  Of course the last two  methods may come at a price as they tend to reduce the company  s overall financial  strength  The challenges of managing liquidity include developing  implementing  and  maintaining a liquidity policy  To do this effectively a company must manage all of  its key sources of liquidity efficiently  These key sources may vary from company to  company but they generally include the primary sources of liquidity such as cash  balances  and secondary sources of liquidity such as selling assets  
6,160,      Primary Sources of Liquidity
7,160,Primary sources of liquidity represent the most readily accessible resources available   They may be held as cash or as near  cash securities   Primary sources include     Ready cash balances  which is cash available in bank accounts  resulting from  payment collections  investment income liquidation of near  cash securities  i e   those with maturities of less than    days  and other cash flows      Short  term funds  which may include items such as trade credit  bank lines of  credit  and short  term investment portfolios      Cash flow management  which is the company  s effectiveness in its cash man  agement system and practices  and the degree of decentralization of the collec  tions or payments processes   The more decentralized the system of collections   for example the more likely the company will be to have cash tied up in the  system and not available for use  These sources represent liquidity that is typical for most companies   They represent  funds that are readily accessible at relatively low cost  
8,160,      Secondary Sources of Liquidity
9,160,The main difference between the primary and secondary sources of liquidity is that  using a primary source is not likely to affect the normal operations of the company  whereas using a secondary source may result in a change in the company  s financial  and operating positions   Secondary sources include     negotiating debt contracts  relieving pressures from high interest payments or  principal repayments  
1,161,   
2,161,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,161,   liquidating assets  which depends on the degree to which short  term and or  long  term assets can be liquidated and converted into cash without substantial  loss in value  and    filing for bankruptcy protection and reorganization  Use of secondary sources may signal a company  s deteriorating financial health  and provide liquidity at a high price the cost of giving up a company asset to pro  duce emergency cash  The last source reorganization through bankruptcy may also  be considered a liquidity tool because a company under bankruptcy protection that  generates operating cash will be liquid and generally able to continue business oper  ations until a restructuring has been devised and approved 
4,161,      Drags and Pulls on Liquidity
5,161,Cash flow transactions that is  cash receipts and disbursements have significant  effects on a company  s liquidity position  We refer to these effects as drags and pulls  on liquidity  A drag on liquidity is when receipts lag  creating pressure from the  decreased available funds   a pull on liquidity is when disbursements are paid too  quickly or trade credit availability is limited requiring companies to expend funds  before they receive funds from sales that could cover the liability  Major drags on receipts involve pressures from credit management and deterio  ration in other assets and include     Uncollected receivables  The longer these are outstanding  the greater the risk  that they will not be collected at all  They are indicated by the large number of  days of receivables and high levels of bad debt expenses   Just as the drags on  receipts may cause increased pressures on working capital pulls on outgoing  payments may have similar effects      Obsolete inventory  If inventory stands unused for long periods  it may be an  indication that it is no longer usable  Slow inventory turnover ratios can also  indicate obsolete inventory  Once identified obsolete inventory should be  attended to as soon as possible in order to minimize storage and other costs      Tight credit   When economic conditions make capital scarcer short  term debt  becomes more expensive to arrange and use  Attempting to smooth out peak  borrowings can help blunt the impact of tight credit as can improving the com  pany  s collections   In many cases  drags may be alleviated by stricter enforcement of credit and collection  practices    However managing the cash outflows may be as important as managing the  inflows   If suppliers and other vendors who offer credit terms perceive a weakened  financial position or are unfamiliar with a company they may restrict payment terms  so much that the company  s liquidity reserves are stretched thin  Major pulls on  payments include     Making payments early  By paying vendors  employees  or others before the due  dates  companies forgo the use of funds   Effective payment management means  not making early payments   Payables managers typically hold payments until  they can be made by the due date

3,162,   Reduced credit limits  If a company has a history of making late payments   suppliers may cut the amount of credit they will allow to be outstanding at  any time which can squeeze the company  s liquidity  Some companies try to  extend payment periods as long as possible disregarding the possible impact of  reduced credit limits      Limits on short  term lines of credit  If a company  s bank reduces the line of  credit it offers the company a liquidity squeeze may result   Credit line restric  tions may be government  mandated market  related or simply company   specific  Many companies try to avert this situation by establishing credit lines  far in excess of what they are likely to need  This  over  banking  approach is  often commonplace in emerging economies or even in more  developed coun  tries where the banking system is not sound and the economy is shaky     Low liquidity positions  Many companies face chronic liquidity shortages  often  because of their particular industry or from their weaker financial position  The  major remedy for this situation is  of course to improve the company  s financial  position or else the company will be heavily affected by interest rates and credit  availability  Most companies facing this situation have to deal with secured bor  rowing to obtain any working capital funds   Therefore it is important for these  companies to identify assets that can be used to help support the company  s  short  term borrowing activities   It is critical that these drags and pulls be identified as soon as possible often when  they have not yet happened or have just arisen 
4,162,    Measuring Liquidity
5,162,Liquidity contributes to a company  s credit  worthiness   Credit  worthiness is the  perceived ability of the borrower to pay what is owed on the borrowing in a timely  manner and represents the ability of a company to withstand adverse impacts on its  cash flows   Credit  worthiness allows the company to obtain lower borrowing costs and  better terms for trade credit and contributes to the company  s investment flexibility  enabling it to exploit profitable opportunities   The less liquid the company the greater the risk it will suffer financial distress  or in the extreme case insolvency or bankruptcy  Because debt obligations are paid  with cash the company  s cash flows ultimately determine solvency  The immediate  source of funds for paying bills is cash on hand proceeds from the sale of marketable  securities  or the collection of accounts receivable  Additional liquidity also comes  from inventory that can be sold and thus converted into cash either directly through  cash sales or indirectly through credit sales  i e  accounts receivable   There is  however some point at which a company may have too much invested  in low  and non  earning assets   Cash marketable securities  accounts receivable  and inventory represent a company  s liquidity  However these investments are low  earning relative to the long  term capital investment opportunities that companies  may have available  Various financial ratios can be used to assess a company  s liquidity as well as its  management of assets over time  Here we will look at some of these ratios in a little  more detail  We calculate liquidity ratios to measure a company  s ability to meet short  term  obligations to creditors as they mature or come due  This form of liquidity analysis  focuses on the relationship between current assets and current liabilities and the  rapidity with which receivables and inventory can be converted into cash during  normal business operations  
1,163,   
2,163,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,163,In short  term financial management  a great deal of emphasis is placed on the  levels of and changes in current assets and liabilities   The two most common mea  surements are the current ratio and the quick ratio  The current ratio is the ratio of  current assets to current liabilities  
4,163,Current ratio
5,163, 
6,163,Current assets Current liabilities
7,163,The quick ratio  also known as the acid  test ratio  is the ratio of the quick assets  to current liabilities   Quick assets are those assets that can be most readily converted  to cash  In most situations  the least liquid of the current assets is inventory  Hence  we typically exclude inventory when calculating the quick ratio

15,163,The greater the current ratio or the quick ratio  that is  the greater the potential ability  to cover current liabilities  the higher a company  s liquidity  Whether a given current  or quick ratio is good or bad however depends on a number of factors  including  the trend in these ratios  the comparability of these ratios with competitors  and the  available opportunities in more  profitable long  lived capital investments   In addition to looking at the relations among these balance sheet accounts  we  can also form ratios that measure how well key current assets are managed over time   The key ratios for asset management are turnover ratios   For example the accounts  receivable turnover is the ratio of sales on credit to the average balance in accounts  receivable  
16,163,Accounts receivable turnover
17,163, 
18,163,Credit sales Average receivabl
19,163,ees
20,163,This ratio is a measure of how many times  on average accounts receivable are created  by credit sales and collected on during the fiscal period  As another example the  inventory turnover is the ratio of the cost of goods sold to the balance in inventory  
21,163,Inventory turnover
22,163, 
23,163,Cost of goods sold Average inventory
24,163,This ratio is a measure of how many times  on average inventory is created or acquired  and sold during the fiscal period  Another perspective on the activity within the current accounts is to estimate  the number of days of the current asset or liability that are on hand  For example
25,163,the number of days of receivables also referred to as the day s sales outstanding
26,163,and days in receivables gives us an idea of the management of the extension and  collection of credit to customers

29,163, 
30,163,Accounts receivable Average d aay s sales on credit   Accounts receivable Sales on credit      
31,163,  You will notice that we use credit sales instead of total revenue  the difference lies in the context   Within  the context of working capital management  the corporate financial analyst would have access to details  regarding the company  s credit versus cash sales   For some companies  sales may be for cash or be some  combination of cash sales and credit sales   For the analyst who is looking at the company without benefit  of internal information regarding how much of sales is in the form of credit sales  an approximation is  generally used based on industry norms for credit practices  
1,164,Managing and Measuring Liquidity
2,164,   
3,164,For example if this number of days is      this tells us that it takes  on average       days to collect on the credit accounts   Whether this is good or bad depends on credit  terms that are offered to customers and the relation between sales and the extension  of credit  which is often dictated by industry customs and competitive pressures   The number of days of inventory gives us an indication of how well the inventory  acquisition process  and distribution is managed 
4,164,Number of days of inventory

6,164, 
7,164,Inventory Average day s cost of     goods sold Inventory Cost of goods sold    
8,164,The number of days of inventory also known as the average inventory period day  s  sales in ending inventory and the inventory holding period is the length of time  on average that the inventory remains within the company during the fiscal period   We expect variation in the number of days of inventory among industries because  of differences in the production cycle of different types of inventory  For example  we expect a grocery store to have a lower number of days of inventory than say an  aircraft manufacturer  We can also look at the disbursement side of cash flows with the number of days  of payables which provides a measure of how long it takes the company to pay its  own suppliers  
9,164,Number of days of payables
10,164, 
11,164,Accounts payable Average day s p   uurchases
12,164, 
13,164,Accounts payable Purchases    
14,164,The number of days of payables is also referred to as the day  s payables outstanding  and the average days payable  Purchases are not an item on published financial state  ments  so if you are evaluating a company  s payables  you can estimate the purchases  by using what you know about the company  s cost of goods sold and beginning and  ending balances in inventory   Each of these turnover ratios and numbers of days helps tell a story of how the  company is managing its liquid assets   Like all ratios  the numbers themselves do  not indicate much but when we put these together with trends  information on  the company  s profitability and information about competitors  we develop a good  understanding of a company  s performance   Some of the major applications of this type of analysis include performance eval  uation monitoring  credit  worthiness  and financial projections   But ratios are useful  only when they can be compared  The comparison should be done in two ways com  parisons over time for the same company and over time for the company compared  with its peer group  Peer groups can include competitors from the same industries as  the company as well as other companies with comparable size and financial situations   Consider Wal  Mart Stores  Inc  We can see the change in the current ratio and  quick ratio over the fiscal years      through      in Exhibit   Panel A   Here we see  that the current ratio has declined yet the quick ratio has increased slightly  We can  see what is driving these trends in Panel B of this exhibit   One driver is the efficiency  in the management of inventory which results in holding on to inventory fewer days   as indicated by the downward trend in the number of days of inventory  Putting it in
15,164,  We know that Beginning inventory   Purchases   Cost of goods sold   Ending inventory  Therefore if we  know the inventory balances  from the balance sheet  and the cost of goods sold  from the income statement   we can determine the purchases   Purchases   Cost of goods sold   Ending inventory   Beginning inventory    For example if we see a small number of days of inventory it could mean that the company is managing  its production very efficiently or it could mean that the company is at significant risk of a shortage of inven  tory  We don t know more until we look at what is needed or usual for companies in the industry trends in  turnover for the company and the company  s profitability in relation to the number of days of inventory

2,165,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,165,perspective this trend may be because of in part  the product shift when Wal  Mart  Stores increased its presence in the grocery line of business   Another driver is the  increasing number of days of payables  which means that company is taking longer  to pay what it owes suppliers

29,166,Solution 
30,166,The ratios should be compared in two ways over time  there would typically  be more than two years  worth of data  and against the industry averages   In all  ratios shown here the current year shows improvement over the previous year  in terms of increased liquidity  In each case however the company remains  behind the industry average in terms of liquidity  A brief snapshot such as this  example could be the starting point to initiate or encourage more improvements  with the goal of reaching or beating the industry standards  
31,166,We can combine the number of days of inventory number of days of receivables   and number of days of payables to get a sense of the company  s operating cycle and  net operating cycle  The operating cycle is a measure of the time needed to convert  raw materials into cash from a sale  It consists of the number of days of inventory and  the number of days of receivables  
32,166,Operating cycle Number of days of inventory
33,166, 
34,166, 
35,166,Number of days o ff receivables
36,166,The operating cycle does not take everything into account  however because the  available cash flow is increased by deferring payment to suppliers   This deferral is  considered in the net operating cycle also called the cash conversion cycle  The
1,167,   
2,167,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,167, 
4,167,net operating cycle is a measure of the time from paying suppliers for materials to  collecting cash from the subsequent sale of goods produced from these supplies   It  consists of the operating cycle minus the number of days of payables

6,167, 
7,167, 
8,167,Number of d aays of receivables
9,167, 
10,167,Number of days of payables
11,167,In general the shorter these cycles the greater a company  s cash  generating ability  and the less its need for liquid assets or outside finance  For many companies  the  cash conversion cycle represents a period of time that requires financing that is  the  company offsets some of the financing need by deferring payments through payables  terms  but the remainder must be financed 
12,167,MANAGING THE CASH POSITION
13,167,Although the mix or magnitude of data items may change from day to day the goal is  the same  ensuring that the net cash position is not negative  Ideally the company  s  daily cash inflows and outflows would be equal but this is rarely the case  Without the  reliability of matching these flows  companies must take other steps to ensure that the  flows net out each day  Most companies try to avoid negative balances because the cost  of garnering daily funds by issuing debt or by drawing on bank overdraft facilities is  very costly although the cost of maintaining a small short  term investment portfolio  in terms of an opportunity cost  is regarded as an acceptable cost of doing business   In addition it is difficult to borrow the exact amount needed so many companies  borrow a little extra to be safe and invest any small excesses overnight at lower rates  than if they could invest them earlier or in securities with higher rates   To manage  the cash position effectively the treasury function which is usually responsible for  this activity must gather information from various sources at all times during the day  making decisions based on the latest information  Several critical factors help determine how a company can establish an efficient  cash flow system  In most cases  the central treasury function may not be able to  dictate how the company collects from customers or pays its vendors   What it can  do however is use the best services and techniques associated with the company  s  payment configuration  As an example of a typical cycle of cash management information that occurs  daily consider the process outlined in Exhibit     This hypothetical schedule shows  how important it is to have an efficient  smooth  flowing information system that can  meet the time requirements

13,168,    Forecasting Short  Term Cash Flows
14,168,Forecasting cash flows is necessary to allow effective management of working capital  accounts   For cash forecasting to be effective it has to be relatively precise  However  a forecast that is precise may not be accurate  There are many factors that are outside  of the company  s control such as the general economy unexpected raw material  shortages  and changing interest rates   The uncertainty in forecasting encourages  companies to maintain some minimum level of cash on hand as a buffer 
15,168,      Minimum Cash Balances
16,168,Most companies want a cash buffer as protection from unexpected cash needs or to  provide the financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive opportunities  such as  procuring raw material inventory at a discount   This buffer is often expressed as a  minimum desired cash balance  The size of this buffer depends on several influences   including the variation in the levels of the company  s cash inflows and outflows  the  company  s ability to access other liquidity sources  and the company  s ability to access  borrowing facilities with little lead time 
17,168,      Identifying Typical Cash Flows
18,168,Having an accurate forecast can help a financial manager make better use of the  company  s financial history  Many product lines  especially those that are not in high   growth stages but rather are in steadier mature stages  will have similar cash flows  from year to year or season to season  If an extensive database has been established  it will be possible to draw reasonable projections for the current period or longer  Even in cases of heavy growth through mergers and acquisitions  companies should  try to transfer the acquired company  s cash flow history to be used as a starting point  for consolidating the new operation into the rest of the company  The cash manager  must identify cash flow elements to build a reliable forecast   These elements are not  difficult to identify in general terms  but it is much harder to define them more spe  cifically to be able to collect data regularly  The cash elements that comprise a total forecast vary from company to company   However it is good practice to identify the elements that pertain to any one individual  company  Exhibit   shows typical elements arranged as inflows and outflows   It may  be more useful to try to arrange the elements in this manner i e  show matching  elements by the direction of their flow  in or out   In most cases  a company  s data  elements can be arranged this way to facilitate data gathering  reviewing variances   and presenting final reports to management and other cash users or providers

10,169,      Cash Forecasting Systems
11,169,Cash forecasting should be structured as a system in order to be effective and to do  this  several aspects of the forecast must be considered  We provide some examples  of these aspects in Exhibit   which highlights each aspect for three different forecast  horizons   In some cases  one aspect may be more important than others   For instance  if daily cash is being handled fairly easily it may be more critical to spend time and  resources to ensure that the medium  term forecasting part of the overall system is  functioning at the highest levels of reliability  In addition some factors  such as format  or time horizon should not be changed arbitrarily because change may affect their  accuracy and reliability levels

21,169,    Monitoring Cash Uses and Levels
22,169,Another facet of cash forecasting is monitoring and control  Managing the cash posi  tion essentially means keeping a  running score  on daily cash flows   Monitoring daily  cash flows is a key aspect of a company  s cash forecasting system in that the financial  manager in charge of managing the cash position must know the company  s cash  balance in the bank on virtually a real  time basis   However it really is not forecasting  as such because most of the transactions are actually known  the challenge lies in the
1,170,Investing Short  Term Funds
2,170,   
3,170,collection of this known information in time to do something with that information   For example receiving information about a deposit too late to transfer the funds  renders the information valueless   To receive the appropriate information on a timely basis  information should be  gathered from principal users and providers of cash supplemented by short  term  cash projections in days or even throughout the current day  The minimum level of  cash available is estimated in advance adjusted for known funds transfers  seasonal  ity or other factors  and is used as a target balance figure for each bank   Note that  most companies use one major bank as their lead bank  or concentration bank  and  control the balances for the bank through one main concentration account  with the  target balance applied to the main account   For larger companies  more than one  concentration bank is possible but managing the cash positions in multiple concen  tration banks quickly makes the system complex and requires an efficient information  processing system  For most companies  it is necessary to manage a cash position with the assistance  of short  term investments and borrowings   These short  term liquidity sources help  counter the excesses and deficits that typically occur in a company  s cash flow  The  short  term investments are usually kept in a portfolio that is very liquid with short  maturities   In this way funds are available whenever they are needed but the company  gives up the extra yield that might have been earned if the investments were made  for longer periods of time or with securities with less liquidity  Short  term borrowing  is for very short periods of time but a borrower may find more economies in bor  rowing for regular periods  such as thirty days  to reduce the number of transactions  and associated paperwork   Also by extending the borrowing period companies can  usually obtain better rates and availabilities of funds than if they continually borrow  very short maturities   Many companies face predictable peaks and valleys in their business throughout  the year  For instance manufacturers of consumer electronics products achieve the  bulk of their sales during the holiday shopping season  from late November through  the end of the year  which means that they have build  up of products that are shipped  well before they receive payment   Thus  they have to finance this inventory roll  out  before they receive any cash  During this period they are likely to use up most or  all of the temporary excess funds they set aside or to tap into the credit lines they  arranged for this purpose  When sales roll in during the busy shopping season they  use the proceeds to pay down the borrowing and then invest any excess   Other influencing factors on a company  s cash needs may be associated with  non  operating activities  such as major capital expenditure programs  mergers and  acquisitions  sales or disposition of company assets  and the timing of long  term  financial transactions  such as bond issues  private placements of debt or equity and  equity issues   Predicting the peak need caused by seasonality or other non  operating activities  is important if the company is going to have to borrow funds to cover the need  If a  company sets aside too much it will incur excess costs that are unjustified  If it sets  aside too little it will have to pay a penalty to raise funds quickly  Either case is a  costly error  A reliable forecast can help avoid this situation 
4,170,INVESTING SHORT  TERM FUNDS
5,170,Short  term investments represent a temporary store of funds that are not necessar  ily needed in a company  s daily transactions   If a substantial portion of a company  s  working capital portfolio is not needed for short  term transactions  it should be sep  arated from a working capital portfolio and placed in a longer  term portfolio  Such
6,170, 
1,171,   
2,171,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,171,longer  term portfolios are often handled by another area or are handled by an outside  money manager under the company  s supervision  In this way the risks  maturities   and portfolio management of longer  term portfolios can be managed independently  of the working capital portfolio  Short  term working capital portfolios consist of securities that are highly liquid  less risky and shorter in maturity than other types of investment portfolios   Thus  a  company  s working capital portfolio may consist of short  term debt securities  such as  short  term US government securities and short  term bank and corporate obligations    This type of portfolio changes almost constantly as cash is needed or more excess  cash is available for investments

20,172,Some securities  such as T  bills and banker  s acceptances  are issued at a discount    Thus  the investor invests less than the face value of the security and receives the  face value back at maturity  For instance a    million security that pays   percent in  interest with one month remaining to maturity would be purchased at

3,173,where the second factor    annualizes the monthly yield of        percent  The factor  that is used to annualize the yield depends on the type of security and the traditions  for quoting yields   For example the money market yield is typically annualized using  the ratio of     to the number of days to maturity

16,174,    Strategies
17,174,Short  term investment strategies are fairly simple because the securities in a working  capital portfolio are limited in type and are much shorter in maturity than a longer   term portfolio  Most short  term investors seek  reasonable  returns and do not want  to take on substantial risk   Short  term investment strategies can be grouped into two  types   passive and active  A passive strategy is characterized by one or two decision  rules for making daily investments  whereas an active strategy involves constant  monitoring and may involve matching  mismatching  or laddering strategies   Passive strategies are less aggressive than active ones and place top priority on  safety and liquidity  Yet  passive strategies do not have to offer poor returns  especially  if companies have reliable cash forecasts   Often companies with good cash forecasts  can combine a passive strategy with an active matching strategy to enhance the yield  of a working capital portfolio without taking on substantially greater risks   The major problem associated with passive strategies is complacency which can  cause the company to roll over the portfolio mechanically with little attention paid to  yields and more focus on simply reinvesting funds as they mature  Passive strategies  must be monitored and the yield from investment portfolios should be benchmarked  regularly against a suitable standard such as a T  bill with comparable maturity  Active strategies require more daily involvement and possibly a wider choice of  investments   Although investments are rolled over with an active strategy just as they  are with a passive strategy this type of strategy calls for more shopping around better  forecasts  and a more flexible investment policy guideline  Active strategies can include intentional matching or mismatching the timing of  cash outflows with investment maturities   A matching strategy is the more con  servative of the two and uses many of the same investment types as are used with  passive strategies   A mismatching strategy is riskier and requires very accurate and
1,175,   
2,175,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,175,reliable cash forecasts   These strategies usually use securities that are more liquid  such as T  bills  so that securities can be liquidated if adverse market conditions arise   Mismatching strategies may also be accomplished using derivatives  which may pose  additional risks to a company unaccustomed to buying and selling derivatives   A laddering strategy is another form of active strategy which entails scheduling  maturities on a systematic basis within the investment portfolio such that investments  are spread out equally over the term of the ladder  A laddering strategy falls some  where between a matching and a passive strategy  Laddering strategies have been used  effectively in managing longer  term investment portfolios  but laddering also should  be an effective short  term strategy  Managing a working capital portfolio involves handling and safeguarding assets  of the company  Accordingly companies with investment portfolios should have a  formal written policy guideline that protects the company and the investment man  agers   Investment policy guidelines should not be very lengthy especially because  they must be understood by the company  s investment managers and communicated  to the company  s investment dealers   Although the investment policy guideline should be customized for an individual  company the basic structure of such a policy is provided in Exhibit

11,176,Working Capital Portfolio Investment Policy Guidelines
12,176,   Purpose  This is a working capital portfolio with emphasis on safety and  liquidity  We will sacrifice return for either of these two goals      Authorities   The treasurer with agreement from the CFO will be in  charge of managing short  term investments   Authority and control to  execute can be delegated by the treasurer or CFO to another treasury  manager if documented     Maximum maturity   Securities may not be made for longer than three      years      Types amounts of investments permitted  no more than    percent of the  portfolio or     million with any issuer subject to the credit limitation  that any eligible issuer must be rated A    P    by Standard   Poor  s and  Moody  s      Repurchase agreements must be equal to or preferably exceed the PSA  Standard Investment Agreement  which requires     percent collateral for  repurchases      All investments must be held in safekeeping by XYZ Bank      The investment manager can execute exception transactions but must  document them in writing

3,177,Solution to   
4,177,The policy is fairly effective in that it tries to provide simple understandable  rules   It calls for credit quality limits the possible position with any single issuer  accepts market standards  such as the PSA  and calls for safekeeping   It also  has an exception procedure that is straightforward 
5,177,Solution to   
6,177,The credit ratings may be too restrictive  Many investment securities may  not be rated by both S P and Moody  s  which is implied if not stated in the  policy  Also the    percent limitation apparently is to be applied to all securi  ties   However most investment managers do not consider securities issued by  governmental agencies or the government itself to be so risky that a limitation  needs to be applied 
7,177,Solution to   
8,177,The words  or equivalent  should be added to the credit quality of the types of  investments   Also there should be no limitation to highly rated governmental  securities  such as US Treasury  bills and the equivalent from the major devel  oped countries   A credit rating reference could be applied to determine eligible  governmental securities

4,178,MANAGING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
5,178,Credit accounts vary by type of customer and the industry and granting credit involves  a tradeoff between increasing sales and uncollectible accounts   There are three primary  activities in accounts receivable management   granting credit and processing transac  tions  monitoring credit balances  and measuring performance of the credit function  Processing accounts receivable transactions requires recording credit sales to  create a record and posting customer payments or at least monitoring the posting  to the accounts receivable account by applying the payment against the customer  s  outstanding credit balance  Monitoring the outstanding accounts receivable requires  a regular reporting of outstanding receivable balances and notifying the collection  managers of past due situations   Monitoring is an ongoing activity  Measuring the  performance of the credit functions entails preparing and distributing key performance  measurement reports  including an accounts receivable aging schedule and day  s sales  outstanding reports   Essentially the accounts receivable management function is a go  between for the  credit manager treasury manager and accounting manager  This role is an important  one because it can slow up the recording of payments  which may in turn prevent  customers from purchasing more of the company  s products or worse yet  could  prevent the treasury manager from depositing the check and converting the check  to available funds   The accounts receivable management function is also considered to be a derivative  activity from credit granting because it helps in providing information needed by the  credit management function  It depends on the source of the sale for its records  on  the credit manager for additional information on the status of the accounts receivable  record and possibly on the treasury manager to establish an efficient system of getting  the payment information to the accounts receivable manager for cash application   e g   from a bank lockbox   The goals for the accounts receivable management system include the following     efficient processing and maintaining accurate up  to  date records that are avail  able to credit managers and other interested parties as soon as possible after  payments have been received     control of accounts receivable and ensuring that accounts receivable records  are current and that no unauthorized entry into the accounts receivable file has  occurred     collection on accounts and coordination with the treasury management  function     coordination and notification with the credit managers frequently   and    preparation of regular performance measurement reports   Companies may achieve scale economies by centralizing the accounts receivable  function by using a captive finance subsidiary   A captive finance subsidiary is a  wholly owned subsidiary of the company that is established to provide financing of  the sales of the parent company 
6,178,  As pointed out by Shehzad L   Mian and Clifford W  Smith   Accounts Receivable Management Policy    Theory and Evidence  Journal of Finance vol     no     March       pp           companies that have  highly variable accounts receivable  for example from seasonality  may find the use of a captive finance  subsidiary attractive because it may allow the subsidiary  s debt indentures to differ from those of the  parent company

3,179,One of the challenges in accounts receivable management is monitoring receiv  ables and collecting on accounts   Many companies resort to outsourcing the accounts  receivable function primarily to increase the collection on accounts  provide credit  evaluation services  and to apply the most recent technology  Also some companies  may invest in credit insurance which reduces the risk of bad debts and shifts some  of the evaluation of credit  worthiness to the insurer 
4,179,    Key Elements of the Trade Credit Granting Process
5,179,Credit management is an integral part of the collection process   It sets the frame  work for sales in that it can restrict sales by rejecting credit or expand it by loosening  acceptance criteria   It also links the collection and cash application processes and has  a profound effect on the method of collection as well  In addition credit management  techniques incorporate fundamental financial analysis methods in setting credit policy  granting credit  and managing existing credit customers   A weak  ineffective credit management function may enhance sales  but many  of those sales may become bad debts   On the other hand a strong  active credit  management function can work in tandem with sales and marketing on one side and  accounting and treasury on the other  To establish an effective credit management  function a company must have a well  conceived strategy customized to the company  s  needs and reflecting the company  s goals   Credit management policies are usually established as a set of basic guidelines to  be used by credit managers   A company  s credit policy sets the boundaries for the  credit management function  It lays out procedures as part of the policy and offers  guidance for each typical situation  The policy shows the steps in the granting process  and provides decision rules for specific situations   The policy can also influence the  sales level by making it easy or difficult for customers to buy on credit   Customers may start out with one type of credit account that is restrictive such  as cash on delivery and may eventually demonstrate that they are regular payers and  can be given open book credit accounts   The major types of credit accounts include the following     open book  which is the most common for company to company      documentary with or without lines of credit  most common for cross  border  transactions      installment credit  with regular timed payments   and    revolving credit   The types of credit terms offered vary by type of customer the relative financial  strength of the customer and the type of credit terms the competition is offering    The different forms of terms of credit other than cash which generally implies   to     days  include the following     Ordinary terms  Terms are set forth in a standard format net t or d t  net t   where t in the first example refers to the length of time a customer has to pay  the invoice before becoming past due  In the second example t  is the time  period for taking discounts  and t  is the same as t in the first example  For  example net    means that the full amount of the invoice is due in    days    Most trade credit customers will take the full    days   Terms of      net     mean that the customer can take a   percent discount if the invoice is paid  within    days or else pay the full amount of the invoice by    days from the  invoice date

3,180,   Cash before delivery  CBD  terms require that the amount of the invoice must  be paid in advance before delivery will be scheduled  Checks must clear before  any shipment is made     Cash on delivery  COD  terms require that payment must be made  usually in  the form of a bank check  when the product is delivered  otherwise no delivery  will be made     Bill  to  bill  These terms require that each prior bill must be paid before new  shipments are possible     Monthly billing  These terms require payment monthly  They have a different  format   for example     th Prox net   th means that the customer can take a    percent discount if it pays within the first    days of the next month or else it  must pay the full amount of the invoice by the   th day of the next month  Credit managers may evaluate customers  credit  worthiness using a credit scoring  model  A credit scoring model is a statistical model used to classify borrowers accord  ing to credit  worthiness   These models were first designed for assisting in making  consumer credit decisions   Major credit card issuers needed a tool they could use to  make mass credit decisions   It was also used for small business loans after many larger  banks discovered that their costs of reviewing and deciding whether to grant loans  were such that they could not efficiently make loans of the smaller sizes required by  smaller businesses   To overcome this problem they adopted credit scoring models   Credit scoring models offer an opportunity for a company to make fast decisions  on the basis of simple data  not requiring a great deal of paperwork   The scoring  models give greater weight to such factors as      ready cash  e g   high checking account balances      organization type with corporations rated higher than sole proprietorships or  partnership  and    being current in supplier payments  as indicated by financial services such as  Dun   Bradstreet   The models penalize the potential borrower for      prior late payment behavior or defaults   payment patterns are habitual     heavy use of personal credit cards   no reserves or reduced reserves available     previous personal bankruptcy or tax liens   carries over from person to com  pany   and    high  risk categories   food services  hospitality industries   Credit scoring can also be used to predict late payers  
4,180,    Managing Customers  Receipts
5,180,Cash collections systems are a function of the types of customers a company has and  the methods of payment that the customers use  For instance if a company  s sales  are made at retail locations  it cannot take advantage of the benefits offered by bank  lockbox services   Instead it must deal with organizing and controlling local deposits  and concentrating these deposits efficiently and economically  On the other hand if  a company manufactures and sells products to other businesses  it can use a bank  lockbox services to expedite processing and clearing of check payments   We illustrate a typical network for a company with both electronic and check  payments in Exhibit      Checks from one type of customer are directed to a bank  lockbox  while electronic payments from another type of customer are transmitted  via electronic funds transfer  EFT   through one of the available networks  such as

19,181,In most cases  the best practice for collections involves the establishment of a system  that accelerates payments as well as their information content  such as the customer  s  name and identification number and which invoices are being paid  From the collect  ing company  s point of view the way to achieve this best practice is to establish an  electronic collection network   This can apply to either retail or wholesale companies   Retail payments can be made by credit debit cards or electronic checks  which  are converted to electronic debits or digitized images  or by direct debit   These pay  ments clear electronically and can be facilitated through point of sale  POS  systems   which are systems that capture the transaction data at the physical location in which  the sale is made  A direct debit program is an arrangement whereby the customer  authorizes a debit to a demand account and is used by companies such as utilities   telecommunications service providers  cable companies  insurance companies  and  credit card companies to collect routine payments for services   If payments cannot be converted to electronic payments  the next best practice  is to use a bank lockbox service  A lockbox system is coordinated with the banking  institution in which customer payments are mailed to a post office box and the banking  institution retrieves and deposits these payments several times a day enabling the  company to have use of the fund sooner than in a centralized system in which customer  payments are sent to the company  An acceptable bank lockbox arrangement is one  in which the checks deposited today are available tomorrow or the next business day   This one  day availability lays the groundwork for best practices in cash concentration

3,182,A good performance measure for check deposits is a calculated float factor  The  float in this context is the amount of money that is in transit between payments made  by customers and the funds that are usable by the company  We compute the float  factor by dividing the average daily deposit in dollars into the average daily float

17,182,Cash concentration involves two major activities   consolidating deposits and  moving funds between company accounts or to outside points   The best practice for  cash concentration may be different for consolidating deposits than for moving funds   depending on the timing required and the availability of the funds being transferred  For bank lockbox concentration assuming that the checks clear in one business  day  on average  the concentration technique of choice is the electronic funds transfer  method  In this method bank lockbox personnel call in the deposit via a reporting  service or directly to the concentration bank   The concentration bank creates an  electronic funds transfer debit that clears overnight  giving the company available  funds in its concentration account   This system can be set up to run with or without  intervention by the company  s cash manager  In most cases  the best practice does  not involve any intervention  Electronic funds transfers offer distinct advantages to companies that use them  for concentration of funds   First  they are substantially cheaper than the alternative  the wire transfer  In addition they are reliable in that the transfer can be made part

4,183,    Evaluating Accounts Receivable Management
5,183,There are numerous ways of measuring accounts receivable performance  Most of them  deal with how effectively outstanding accounts receivable items can be converted into  cash  Measures can be derived from general financial reports as well as more detailed  internal financial records   Many measures  such as number of days of receivables  can be calculated easily  from financial statements   The standard number of days of receivables evaluates the  total receivables outstanding but does not consider the age distribution within this  outstanding balance 
6,183,      Accounts Receivable Aging Schedule
7,183,One key report that accounts receivable managers should use is the aging schedule  which is a breakdown of the accounts into categories of days outstanding   We pro  vide an example of an aging schedule in Exhibit     Panel A   As you can see in this  example the report shows the total sales and receivables for each reporting period   typically    days   It is handier to convert the aging schedule to percentages  as we  show in this exhibit  Note that in the exhibit it is easy to spot a change in April s aging   Accounts receivable have not been collected and converted to cash as rapidly as in  previous months   In this case the April change should be scrutinized  For example  the extension of credit terms may have been increased as part of a special program   This change could also signal a change in payments by the company  s customers

21,184,      The Number of Days of Receivables
22,184,The number of days of receivables gives us the overall picture of accounts receivable  collection  We can compare the number of days with the credit policy to give us an  idea of how well the company is collecting on its accounts  relative to the terms that  it grants credit   But we can take this a step further by calculating a weighted average  of the collection period or weighted average day  s sales outstanding   By focusing on  the time it takes to collect receivables  the weighted average collection period is a good  measure of how long it is taking to collect from the company  s customers regardless  of the sales level or the changes in sales   The calculation of the weighted average collection period requires data on the  number of days it takes to collect accounts of each age grouping   For example we could  group receivables in regular increments  such as     day periods  and then weight the  collection period in each group by the monetary amount of accounts in the group  Using the data provided in Exhibit    Panel A  it is possible to compute number  of days of receivables for March and April as shown in Panel B of this exhibit   As  you can see in this example we can get a better idea of why the number of days of  receivables changed from one month to the next  The weighted average collection days  increased from March to April primarily because of the large representation in receiv   able accounts in the       and       day ranges  which made up only      percent        percent        percent of accounts in March but    percent of accounts in April  The primary drawback to this measure is that it requires more information than  number of days of receivables  and this information is not readily available especially  for comparisons among companies

5,185,The primary goal for an inventory system is to maintain the level of inventory so that  production management and sales management can make and sell the company  s  products without more than necessary invested in this asset   Like cash and accounts  receivable management  inventory management involves balancing  having sufficient  inventory but not too much  Inventory is a current asset that is created by purchasing  paid by accounts payable  and funded by the treasury  The investment in inventory does not produce cash until  it is sold or otherwise disposed of  Excessive levels of inventory can possibly overstate  the value of inventory because the more that is on hand the greater the potential for  obsolete inventory which can be sold off but at a discount   Shortages of inventory  result in lost sales   The amount of inventory that a company holds or feels it has to hold creates a  financial requirement for the company  If the company  s product lines are more diverse  or if its production processes are more involved in using inventory to make final  products and then store the products  the company may have a significant financial  investment in inventory  The investment in inventory has been quite staggering for many companies  which  has caused them to look for new inventory management techniques   New techniques  in inventory control aided by improved technology have enabled substantial reduction  of the inventory levels a company must maintain and still be able to make products and  have them available for sale as needed  For instance newer just  in  time approaches  to inventory management have lowered required inventory balances and cemented  major trading partner relationships   The motives for holding inventory which dictate how much inventory will be held  and in turn how much working capital will be tied up in inventory are very similar  to the need for holding cash  The major motives include the transactions motive the  precautionary motives  and the speculative motive  The transactions motive reflects the need for inventory as part of the routine  production sales cycle  Inventory need is equal to the planned manufacturing activity  and the approach to inventory will be dictated by the manufacturing plan  Precautionary stocks also may be desirable to avoid any stock  out losses which  are profits lost from not having sufficient inventory on hand to satisf y demand   Managing inventory well means keeping extra inventory especially if it could become  obsolete quickly at a minimum  To do this  a company must have a reliable forecast  and a flexible inventory approach  In addition many companies that do not have a  reliable forecast maintain a reserve as a precaution for shortfalls in the plan  Of course  how much stock is determined by the lead time for additional inventory purchases   the length of time it takes to deliver final products to the market  and how much can  be spent on extra inventory  In certain industries  managers may acquire inventory for speculative reasons   such as ensuring the availability and pricing of inventory  Inventory managers working  together with purchasing managers can benefit from out  of  the  ordinary purchases    For instance if a publisher is certain that paper costs will be increasing for the next  year it can buy more paper in the current year and store it for future use  This decision  assumes that the storage costs are not greater than the savings   Companies usually attempt to strike a balance in managing their inventory levels    Overinvestment can result in liquidity squeezes or related problems with an increase  in debt without an increase in cash  Overinvestment can also lead to the misuse of  facilities as more storage is required for the built  up inventory  Having large amounts

3,186,of inventory on hand can result in losses from shrinkage spoilage and so on  Finally  overinvestment can reduce the company  s competitiveness as it may not be able to  match pricing because of its large inventory costs   On the other hand underinvestment in inventory can create problems from losing  customers who could not purchase a product or gaining their ill  will from long delays  in delivery  Plant shutdowns and expensive special runs can also be costly  Finally a risk  with underinvestment is the company  s inability to avoid price increases by suppliers  
4,186,    Approaches to Managing Levels of Inventory
5,186,To control inventory costs  a company should adopt the appropriate approach for its  inventory  The two basic approaches are the economic order quantity and just  in  time  Many companies use the classical approach economic order quantity reorder  point  EOQ ROP  at least for some portion of their inventory  This method is based  on expected demand and the predictability of demand and it requires determining  the level of inventory at which new inventory is ordered  This ordering point is deter  mined based on the costs of ordering and carrying inventory such that the total cost  associated with inventory is minimized  The demand and lead times determine the  inventory level  For EOQ ROP to work well there must be a reliable short  term fore  cast   Often a company may use EOQ ROP for smaller items that have low unit costs   Use of the EOQ ROP method may involve safety stocks and anticipation stocks   A  safety stock is a level of inventory beyond anticipated needs that provides a cushion  in the event that it takes longer to replenish inventory than expected or in the case of  greater than expected demand  A company may consider the number of days of inven  tory on hand and the lead time in replenishing stock in determining the appropriate  level of the safety stock   An anticipation stock is inventory in excess of that needed  for anticipated demand which may fluctuate with the company  s sales or production  seasonality  We illustrate the EOQ ROP method in Exhibit

27,186,Time
28,186,The just  in  time  JIT   method is a system that minimizes in  process inventory  stocks raw materials and in production by evaluating the entire system of the  delivery of materials and production  Materials are ordered for example at a point at  which current stocks of material reach a reorder point  a point determined primarily  by historical demand  Materials or manufacturing resource planning  MRP  systems  incorporate production planning into inventory management   The analysis of pro  duction and materials needed for production are incorporated into an analysis that
1,187,   
2,187,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,187,provides both a materials acquisition schedule and a production schedule  Combining  the JIT and MRP methods can provide a broader base for integrating inventory into  the company  s supply chain management and effectively reduce inventory levels    In most instances  companies will have several types of inventory that can be  managed effectively using one or more of these approaches   Obviously a company  should select the method that allows the most cost  beneficial investment in inventory 
4,187,    Inventory Costs
5,187,There are several component costs of inventory  Some components represent oppor  tunity costs  whereas others may be real costs   The component costs include     Ordering  Procurement or replenishment costs  both of which may be fixed or  variable  These costs depend on the number of orders placed  Examples   freight   labor and handling  paperwork  machine setup     Carrying  Financing and holding costs  which are opportunity or real costs    These costs depend on average inventory levels and the type of goods    Examples   storage capital costs  obsolescence insurance and taxes      Stock  out   Opportunity or real costs  which are affected by level of inventory  item mix  processing time versus term of sale  These costs might vary greatly  depending on how they are estimated  Examples   lost sales  back  order costs   substitution costs      Policy  Costs of gathering data and general operating costs  which may be real  costs or  soft  costs   These costs depend on inventory mix and complexity   Examples   data processing  labor charges  overtime training  
6,187,    Evaluating Inventory Management
7,187,The most common way to measure the company  s investment in inventory and  evaluate its inventory management is to compute the inventory turnover ratio and  the number of days of inventory  The inventory turnover is a rough measure but it  is simple to calculate and compare with other standards or past history  Inventory  turnover will vary among industries  as you can see in Exhibit     which provides a  calculated inventory turnover and number of days of inventory for various industries   Further the inventory turnover may differ among companies within an industry  because of different product mixes   For example in fiscal year      Wal  Mart Stores  had an inventory turnover of     times compared with Target s     times   This differ  ence may be because of Wal  Mart s greater foothold in the higher turnover grocery  business  as compared with Target   Although the analysis of trends is important  care should be taken when inter  preting changes   For example a decrease in the inventory turnover may mean that  more inventory is on hand and is not moving through manufacturing and being  sold  On the other hand a decrease in inventory turnover may indicate a change in  the company  s product mix  or it may mean that the company is reducing its risk of  inventory stock  outs  
8,187,  Some companies have integrated cash management and inventory management  For example the moment  a customer orders and pays for a computer with Dell Corporation the production process begins   This effi  ciency results in a negative operating cycle  that is  Dell Corporation is collecting on accounts as it invests in  the inventory production  Because it uses trade credit for its supplies  it has little need for working capital

18,188,MANAGING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
19,188,Accounts payable are amounts due suppliers of goods and services that have not been  paid  They arise from trade credit which is a spontaneous form of credit in which  a purchaser of the goods or service is  effectively financing its purchase by delaying  the date on which payment is made  Trade credit may involve a delay of payment   with a discount for early payment   The terms of the latter form of credit are generally  stated in the discount form  A discount from the purchase price is allowed if payment  is received within a specified number of days   otherwise the full amount is due by a  specified date  For example the terms       net     indicate that a   percent discount  is available if the account is paid within    days   otherwise the full amount is due by  the   th day  The terms will differ among industries  influenced by tradition within  the industry terms of competitors  and current interest rates  
1,189,   
2,189,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,189,A key working capital link is the purchasing inventory payables process   This  process is concerned with the procurement of goods finished or not that become  the company  s items for sale  Handled efficiently the process minimizes excess funds   in the pipeline   Handled inefficiently the process can create a severe drain on a  company  s liquidity tying up funds and reducing the company  s financial reserves   Inefficiencies may arise in managing purchasing  inventory and payables   Each  area has to be organized and efficiently linked with the other areas   Purchasing can  often influence how payments are to be made and the terms of credit   Here again  purchasing management needs to be kept informed as to the types of payment mech  anisms the company can handle to avoid agreeing with suppliers to make payments  in a medium that the company does not yet support   The effective management of accounts payable is an important working capital  management activity because inefficient payables management may result in oppor  tunity costs from payments made too early lost opportunities to take advantage of  trade discounts  and failure to use the benefits of technologies offered by e  commerce  and other web  based activities   Accounts payable is the final step in the procurement cycle because it combines  the paperwork  approvals  and disbursements of funds   An effective accounts payable  function helps integrate the components of the cycle and does not require the uneco  nomical outlay of the company  s funds until the outlay is due  A company may not believe that it needs a formal guideline or policy to manage the  function well  However there must be some method to ensure that payables practices  are organized consistent  and cost  effective  For example if payables management  is decentralized and more than one operating entity deals with the same supplier  the credit terms offered to each entity should be the same unless there are special  circumstances  such as volume constraints  that warrant different terms   To handle  payables effectively a company needs rules to ensure that company assets are not  being depleted unnecessarily  There are several factors that a company should consider as guidelines for effec  tively managing its accounts payable including     Financial organization s centralization  The degree to which the company  s core  financial function is centralized or decentralized affects how tightly payables  can be controlled     Number size  and location of vendors  The composition of the company  s supply  chain and how dependent the company is on its trading partners  and vice  versa  determines how sophisticated a payables system it needs      Trade credit and cost of borrowing or alternative cost   The importance of credit  to the company and its ability to evaluate trade credit opportunities  such as  trade discounts  encourages standardized payables procedures and enhanced  information management throughout the company     Control of disbursement float   Many companies still pay suppliers by check and  create disbursement float the amount of time between check issuance and  a check s clearing back against the company  s account   This float has value to  many companies because it allows them to use their funds longer than if they  had to fund their checking account on the day the checks were mailed     Inventory management   Newer inventory control techniques  such as MRP  and JIT increase the number of payments that must be processed by accounts  payable  Many older systems cannot accommodate this extra volume so newer  management techniques and systems are required     E  commerce and electronic data interchange  EDI   Global developments to  use the internet and other direct connections between customer and supplier  are revolutionizing the supply chain for many companies   Because payments
1,190,Managing Accounts Payable
2,190,   
3,190,for many of these activities should be considered as part of the overall process   many companies have determined that paying electronically offers a more  efficient  cost  effective alternative to checks  which only are more valuable when  the disbursement float value is large and interest rates  which provide value to  float  are also high  Stretching payables  also known as pushing on payables when it stretches beyond  the due date is sometimes done by corporate cash managers and other financial  managers    Stretching payables is taking advantage of vendor grace periods   The  evaluation of payables stretching opportunities is fairly straightforward  The number  of additional days that payments can be extended or stretched is determined and  valued by applying the company  s opportunity cost for the additional days times the  amount of the payable  For example if a payable that averaged         can be stretched for an addi  tional seven days  the company gains an additional seven days  use of the funds   This  opportunity can be valued by multiplying the amount          by the company  s  opportunity cost for short  term funds   For example if the company  s estimated cost  for short  term funds is   percent annually          percent daily  then the value of  stretching a         payment for seven days is          The values for each opportunity   throughout a year  s activity  can be valued in this way to determine the overall benefit  which can then be weighed against the costs  both financial and nonfinancial ones   There are basically two countering forces   paying too early is costly unless the  company can take advantage of discounts  and paying late affects the company  s  perceived credit  worthiness  
4,190,    The Economics of Taking a Trade Discount
5,190,One key activity that companies should review from time to time is the evaluation of  trade discounts   Trade discounts should be evaluated using the formula shown below  which computes the implicit rate  of return  that is represented by the trade discount  offer   that is  it is the equivalent return to the customer of an alternative investment   The implicit rate is calculated as follows

17,190,      
18,190,   
19,190,The cost of funds during the discount period is   percent  so it is beneficial for the  customer to pay close to the end of the discount period  Once the discount period  ends  the cost of the credit to the customer jumps up and then declines as the net day  is approached  For example if the terms are      net    which means that there is a    percent discount for paying within    days and the net amount is due by the   th  day the cost of trade credit is     percent if the credit is paid on the   th day but it  is only      percent if paid on the   th day  If the customer  s cost of funds or short  term investment rate is less than the  calculated rate the discount offers a better return or incremental return over the  company  s short  term borrowing rate 
20,190,  Keep in mind that stretching payments beyond their due dates might be considered unethical and may  draw retaliation from suppliers in the form of tighter credit terms in the future

35,191,    Managing Cash Disbursements
36,191,Handling cash disbursements effectively is a common goal for most companies   To  accomplish this  companies use best practices that include the ability to delay funding  bank accounts until the day checks clear to erect safeguards against check fraud to  pay electronically when it is cost  effective to do so and to manage bank charges for  disbursement services   Best practices in cash disbursements  like check collections   depend on the nature of the payments i e  whether they are made electronically or  by check   Banks offer controlled disbursement services to optimize the funding of checks  on the same day they clear against the company  s account   When combined with a  positive pay service which provides a filter against check fraud this method provides  the best practice in handling paper  based  check  disbursements  
37,191,    Evaluating Accounts Payable Management
38,191,The number of days of payables  which is also referred to as the average age of pay  ables  is a useful measure in evaluating a company  s credit extension and collection  If the accounts payable balance from the company  s balance sheet is      million  and the amount of purchases is       million the number of days of payables is

4,192,MANAGING SHORT  TERM FINANCING
5,192,An overall short  term financial strategy should focus on ensuring that the company  maintains a sound liquidity position  It should also reflect the degree of risk the com  pany believes can be managed without affecting the company  s stability  It is common  to consider short  term financial strategies as applying mostly to investments   However  they should include other financial activities as well  In many cases  a company will  only be an investor or borrower but it is common for large multinational corporations  to have both short  term investments and short  term borrowing   A short  term policy should include guidelines for managing investment  borrow  ing  foreign exchange and risk management activities and should encompass all the  company  s operations  including foreign subsidiaries and other domestic subsidiaries  that are self  financing   These guidelines accomplish several things   Too often companies do not explore their options sufficiently and as a result  they  do not take advantage of cost savings that some forms of borrowing offer  This lack of  awareness usually indicates that a company  s treasurer may not be familiar with the  common forms of short  term borrowing and has not factored them into an effective  borrowing strategy 
6,192,    Sources of Short  Term Financing
7,192,The main types of short  term borrowing alternatives that borrowers should consider  include bank sources as well as money market sources   The main types of bank  short  term borrowing include uncommitted and committed bank lines of credit and  revolving credit agreements   revolvers    The latter two types can be unsecured or  secured depending on the company  s financial strength and the general credit situation  which may vary from country to country  Two of these types uncommitted lines and  revolvers are more common in the United States  whereas regular lines are more  common in other parts of the world  We provide examples of several types of short   term borrowing options in Exhibit    with bank sources in Panel A of this exhibit and  nonbank sources in Panel B  In this exhibit  we provide the primary features for each  type of borrowing  including the typical users  source s  for the alternative the base  rate for computing interest  type of compensation required and any other comments

34,193,Uncommitted lines of credit are as the name suggests  the least reliable form of  bank borrowing   A bank may offer an uncommitted line of credit for an extended  period of time but it reserves the right to refuse to honor any request for use of the  line  In other words  an uncommitted line is very unstable and is only as good as the  bank s desire to offer it   Therefore companies should not rely very much on uncom  mitted lines   In fact  banks will not  officially   acknowledge that an uncommitted  line is usable which means that uncommitted lines cannot be shown as a financial  reserve in a footnote to the company  s financial statements   The primary attraction of  uncommitted lines is that they do not require any compensation other than interest   Committed lines of credit are the form of bank line of credit that most companies  refer to as regular lines of credit   They are more reliable than uncommitted because  of the bank s formal commitment  which can be verified through an acknowledgment  letter as part of the annual financial audit and can be footnoted in the company  s  annual report   These lines of credit are in effect for     days  one day short of a full  year   This effectively makes sure that they are short  term liabilities  usually classified  as notes payable or the equivalent  on the financial statements   Regular lines are unsecured and are pre  payable without any penalties   The  borrowing rate is a negotiated item  The most common interest rates negotiated are  borrowing at the bank s prime rate or at a money market rate plus a spread  The most  common money market rate is an offshore rate the London interbank offered rate   Libor  which is a Eurodollar rate plus a spread  The spread varies depending on  the borrower  s credit  worthiness   Regular lines  unlike uncommitted lines  require  compensation usually in the form of a commitment fee  The fee is typically a frac  tional percent  e g     percent  of the full amount or the unused amount of the line  depending on bank company negotiations   Revolving credit agreements which are often referred to as revolvers  are the  most reliable form of short  term bank borrowing facilities   They have formal legal  agreements that define the aspects of the agreement   These agreements are similar  to regular lines with respect to borrowing rates  compensation and being unsecured   Revolvers differ in that they are in effect for multiple years  e g       years  and may  have optional medium  term loan features   In addition they are often done for much  larger amounts than a regular line and these larger amounts are spread out among  more than one bank

5,194,Given the various forms of short  term borrowing  it is essential that a borrower have a  planned strategy before getting stuck in an uneconomical situation  Many borrowing  companies spend too little time establishing a sound strategy for their short  term  borrowing beyond making sure that they are able to borrow at all from any source  The major objectives of a short  term borrowing strategy include the following     Ensuring that there is sufficient capacity to handle peak cash needs      Maintaining sufficient sources of credit to be able to fund ongoing cash needs      Ensuring that rates obtained are cost  effective and do not substantially exceed  market averages   In addition there are several factors that borrowers should consider as part of their  short  term borrowing strategies  including the following     Size and credit  worthiness  There is no doubt that the size of the borrower dic  tates the options available  Larger companies can take advantage of economies  of scale to access commercial paper banker  s acceptances  and so on  The size  of the borrower often reflects a manufacturing company  s need for short  term  financing   The size of lender is also an important criterion as larger banks have  higher house or legal lending limits   Credit  worthiness of the borrower will  determine the rate compensation or even whether the loan will be made at all     Sufficient access  Borrowers should diversify to have adequate alternatives  and not be too reliant on one lender or form of lending if the amount of their  lending is very large  Even so it is typical for borrowers to use one alternative  primarily but often with more than one provider  Borrowers should be ready to  go to other sources and know how to  Borrowers should not stay too long with  just one source or with lowest rates   Many borrowers are usually prepared to  trade off rates  somewhat  for certainty     Flexibility of borrowing options  Flexibility means the ability to manage matur  ities efficiently   that is  there should not be any  big  days  when significant  amounts of loans mature  To do this successfully borrowers need active matu  rity management  awareness of the market conditions  e g   knowing when the  market or certain maturities should be avoided  and the ability to prepay loans  when unexpected cash receipts happen  Borrowing strategies  like investment strategies  can be either passive or active   Passive strategies usually involve minimal activity with one source or type of bor  rowing and with little  if any  planning   This  take what you can get  strategy is often  reactive in responding to immediate needs or  panic attacks    Passive strategies are  characterized by steady often routine rollovers of borrowings for the same amount  of funds each time without much comparison shopping   Passive strategies may also  arise when borrowing is restricted such as instances where borrowers are limited to  one or two lenders by agreement  e g   in a secured loan arrangement  
1,195,   
2,195,Reading      Working Capital Management
3,195,Active strategies are usually more flexible reflecting planning  reliable forecasting   and seeking the best deal  With active strategies  borrowers are more in control and  do not fall into the rollover  trap  that is possible with passive strategies   Many active strategies are matching strategies   Matching borrowing strategies  function in a manner similar to matching investment strategies loans are scheduled  to mature when large cash receipts are expected  These receipts can pay back the loan  so the company does not have to invest the funds at potentially lower rates than the  borrowing cost  thereby creating unnecessary costs  
4,195,    Asset  Based Loans
5,195,Many companies that do not have the credit quality sufficient to qualify for unsecured  bank loans may borrow from financial institutions by arranging for a secured loan  where the loan is secured using assets of the company  These secured loans are often  referred to as asset  based loans  Often the assets used in short  term secured loans  are the current assets of receivables and inventory  Unlike the collateral that may be  used in longer  term borrowing  asset  based loans secured by accounts receivable and  inventory present a challenge for the lender because the cash flows from accounts  receivable depend on the amount and timing of collections and are influenced by the  business risk of the company and its customers   Lenders of these short  term asset  based loans are protected by the existence of  the collateral and by provisions in the law that may provide them with a blanket lien  on current and future assets of the company  The downside of a blanket lien is that  even if the asset  based loan was secured by say accounts receivable the lender may  have a legal interest in other assets of the company until the loan is repaid  Besides using working capital as the security for a loan a company can use other  means to generate cash flow from these working capital accounts   For example a com  pany can use its accounts receivable to generate cash flow through the assignment  of accounts receivable which is the use of these receivables as collateral for a loan  or a company can factor its accounts receivable which is selling the receivables to  the factor  In an assignment arrangement  the company remains responsible for the  collection of the accounts  whereas in a factoring arrangement the company is shifting  the credit granting and collection process to the factor  The cost of this credit depends  on the credit quality of the accounts and the costs of collection  Like accounts receivables  inventory may be a source of cash flow through the use  of the inventory as collateral with different types of arrangements possible     An inventory blanket lien in which the lender has a claim on some or all of  the company  s inventory but the company can sell the inventory in the ordinary  course of business      A trust receipt arrangement in which the lender requires the company to  certify that the goods are segregated and held in trust  with proceeds of any sale  remitted to the lender immediately     A warehouse receipt arrangement is similar to the trust receipt arrange  ment  but there is a third party  i e  a warehouse company  that supervises the  inventory  The cost of asset  based loans security by inventory depends on the length of time it  takes to sell the goods

3,196,    Computing the Costs of Borrowing
4,196,In carrying out a sound short  term borrowing strategy one of the key decisions is  selecting the most cost  effective form of short  term loan  However this selection is  often not a simple task  because each of the major forms has to be adjusted to be on  a common basis for comparability  The fundamental rule is to compute the total cost  of the form of borrowing and divide that number by the total amount of loan you  received  i e  net proceeds  adjusted for any discounting or compensating balances   For example in the case of a line of credit that requires a commitment fee  the  cost of the line of credit is
5,196,Cost
6,196, 
7,196, 
8,196,Interest Commitment fee Loan amount
9,196,On the other hand if the interest rate is stated as  all inclusive  such that the amount  borrowed includes the interest as may be the case in a banker  s acceptance the interest  is compared with the net proceeds when determining the cost

15,196, 
16,196,Interest
17,196,If there are dealer  s fees and other fees  the expenses beyond the interest must be  considered when determining the cost   For example if a borrowing involves a dealer  s  fee and a backup fee and is quoted as all inclusive the cost is

3,198,Working capital management covers a wide range of activities  most of which are  focused on or involve the company  s cash levels   Competing uses for the company  s  cash which is often a scarce resource create the need for an efficient method of  handling the short  term financing of company activities   Major points that were covered in this reading     Understanding how to evaluate a company  s liquidity position     Calculating and interpreting operating and cash conversion cycles      Evaluating overall working capital effectiveness of a company and comparing it  with other peer companies      Identifying the components of a cash forecast to be able to prepare a short  term   i e  up to one year  cash forecast      Understanding the common types of short  term investments  and computing  comparable yields on securities      Measuring the performance of a company  s accounts receivable function     Measuring the financial performance of a company  s inventory management  function     Measuring the performance of a company  s accounts payable function     Evaluating the short  term financing choices available to a company and recom  mending a financing method  Working capital management is an integral part of the financial management of  a company because many short  term activities have effects on long  term financial  decisions   Having an effective short  term financial strategy for example allows a  company to plan ahead with the confidence that its short  term concerns are being  handled properly  Perhaps unlike other areas of finance short  term finance has more  qualitative features  making each company  s case somewhat different from another  s    This unique nature combined with the short time frame associated with this aspect  of finance makes short  term finance a dynamic challenging activity

9,207,INTRODUCTION
10,207,In this reading we explain why the portfolio approach is important to all types of  investors in achieving their financial goals   We compare the financial needs of different  types of individual and institutional investors   After we outline the steps in the portfolio  management process  we compare and contrast the types of investment management  products that are available to investors and how they apply to the portfolio approach 
11,207,A PORTFOLIO PERSPECTIVE ON INVESTING
12,207,One of the biggest challenges faced by individuals and institutions is to decide how to  invest for future needs   For individuals  the goal might be to fund retirement needs    For such institutions as insurance companies  the goal is to fund future liabilities in  the form of insurance claims  whereas endowments seek to provide income to meet  the ongoing needs of such institutions as universities   Regardless of the ultimate  goal all face the same set of challenges that extend beyond just the choice of what  asset classes to invest in  They ultimately center on formulating basic principles that

3,208,determine how to think about investing   One important question is   Should we invest  in individual securities  evaluating each in isolation or should we take a portfolio  approach  By  portfolio approach  we mean evaluating individual securities in rela  tion to their contribution to the investment characteristics of the whole portfolio  In  the following section we illustrate a number of reasons why a diversified portfolio  perspective is important  
4,208,    Portfolio Diversification  Avoiding Disaster
5,208,Portfolio diversification helps investors avoid disastrous investment outcomes   This  benefit is most convincingly illustrated by examining what may happen when indi  viduals have not diversified  We are usually not able to observe how individuals manage their personal invest  ments   However in the case of US     k  individual retirement portfolios   it is pos  sible to see the results of individuals  investment decisions   When we examine their  retirement portfolios  we find that some individual participants make sub  optimal  investment decisions   During the     s  Enron Corporation was one of the most admired corporations  in the United States   A position in Enron shares returned over     percent per year  from      to September      compared to    percent for the S P     Index for the  same time period

78,208,  In the United States      k  plans are employer  sponsored individual retirement savings plans   They allow  individuals to save a portion of their current income and defer taxation until the time when the savings and  earnings are withdrawn  In some cases  the sponsoring firm will also make matching contributions in the  form of cash or shares   Individuals within certain limits have control of the invested funds and consequently  can express their preferences as to which assets to invest in

105,209,Employees and retirees who had invested all or most of their retirement savings  in Enron shares  just like Mr  Bruce experienced financial ruin  The hard lesson that  the Enron employees learned from this experience was to  not put all your eggs in one  basket     Unfortunately the typical Enron employee did have most of his or her eggs  in one basket   Most employees  wages and financial assets were dependent on Enron s  continued viability   hence any financial distress on Enron would have a material impact  on an employee s financial health  The bankruptcy of Enron resulted in the closing  of its operations  the dismissal of thousands of employees  and its shares becoming  worthless   Hence the failure of Enron was disastrous to the typical Enron employee  Enron employees were not the only ones to be victims of over  investment in a single  company  s shares   Another form of pension arrangement in many corporations is the  defined contribution plan in which the employer makes periodic cash contributions  to a retirement fund managed by the employees themselves instead of guaranteeing a  certain pension at retirement   In the defined contribution retirement plans at Owens  Corning  Northern Telecom Corning  and ADC Telecommunications  employees

20,211,Suppose you want to invest in one of these five securities next year  There is a  wide variety of risk return trade  offs for the five shares selected  If you believe that  the future will replicate the past  then choosing Li   Fung would be a good choice   For the prior four years  Li   Fung provided the best trade  off between return and  risk   In other words  it provided the most return per unit of risk   However if there  is no reason to believe that the future will replicate the past  it is more likely that the  risk and return on the one security selected will be more like selecting one randomly   When we randomly selected one security each quarter we found an average annualized  return of      percent and an average annualized standard deviation of      percent   which would now become your expected return and standard deviation respectively  Alternatively you could invest in an equally weighted portfolio of the five shares   which means that you would invest the same dollar amount in each security for each  quarter  The quarterly returns on the equally weighted portfolio are just the average  of the returns of the individual shares   As reported in Exhibit   the equally weighted  portfolio has an average return of      percent and a standard deviation of      percent   As expected the equally weighted portfolio s return is the same as the return on the  randomly selected security  However the same does not hold true for the portfolio  standard deviation  That is  the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio is  not simply the average of the standard deviations of the individual shares   In a more  advanced reading we will demonstrate in greater mathematical detail how such a  portfolio offers a lower standard deviation of return than the average of its individual  components due to the correlations or interactions between the individual securities  
1,212,   
2,212,Reading      Portfolio Management  An Overview
3,212,Because the mean return is the same a simple measure of the value of diversification  is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of the equally weighted portfolio to  the standard deviation of the randomly selected security  This ratio may be referred  to as the diversification ratio  In this case the equally weighted portfolio s standard  deviation is approximately     percent of that of a security selected at random  The  diversification ratio of the portfolio s standard deviation to the individual asset s stan  dard deviation measures the risk reduction benefits of a simple portfolio construction  method equal weighting   Even though the companies were chosen from a similar  industry grouping  we see significant risk reduction  An even greater portfolio effect   i e  lower diversification ratio  could have been realized if we had chosen companies  from completely different industries   This example illustrates one of the critical ideas about portfolios   Portfolios affect  risk more than returns   In the prior section portfolios helped avoid the effects of  downside risk associated with investing in a single company  s shares   In this section we  extended the notion of risk reduction through portfolios to illustrate why individuals  and institutions should hold portfolios  
4,212,    Portfolios  Composition Matters for the Risk Return  Trade  off
5,212,In the previous section we compared an equally weighted portfolio to the selection of  a single security  In this section we examine additional combinations of the same set of  shares and observe the trade  offs between portfolio volatility of returns and expected  return  for short  their risk return trade  offs   If we select the portfolios with the best  combination of risk and return  taking historical statistics as our expectations for the  future  we produce the set of portfolios shown in Exhibit

23,212,In addition to illustrating that the diversified portfolio approach reduces risk   Exhibit    also shows that the composition of the portfolio matters   For example an  equally weighted portfolio      percent of the portfolio in each security  of the five  shares has an expected return of       percent and a standard deviation of       per  cent   Alternatively a portfolio with     percent in Yue Yuen Industrial  Holdings      percent in Cathay Pacific     percent in Hutchison Whampoa      percent in Li    Fung  and   percent in COSCO Pacific produces a portfolio with an expected return

4,213,    Portfolios  Not Necessarily Downside Protection
5,213,A major reason that portfolios can effectively reduce risk is that combining securities  whose returns do not move together provides diversification  Sometimes a subset of  assets will go up in value at the same time that another will go down in value  The  fact that these may offset each other creates the potential diversification benefit we  attribute to portfolios   However an important issue is that the co  movement or  correlation pattern of the securities  returns in the portfolio can change in a manner  unfavorable to the investor  We use historical return data from a set of global indexes  to show the impact of changing co  movement patterns   When we examine the returns of a set of global equity indexes over the last    years   we observe a reduction in the diversification benefit due to a change in the pattern of  co  movements of returns   Exhibits   and   show the cumulative returns for a set of  five global indexes  for two different time periods   Comparing the first time period  from Q       through Q        as shown in Exhibit     with the last time period  from Q       through Q        as shown in Exhibit    we show that the degree to  which these global equity indexes move together has increased over time

31,215,    Portfolios  The Emergence of Modern Portfolio Theory
32,215,The concept of diversification has been around for a long time and has a great deal  of intuitive appeal  However the actual theory underlying this basic concept and  its application to investments only emerged in      with the publication of Harry  Markowitz s classic article on portfolio selection   The article provided the foundation  for what is now known as modern portfolio theory  MPT   The main conclusion of  MPT is that investors should not only hold portfolios but should also focus on how  individual securities in the portfolios are related to one another  In addition to the

4,216,diversification benefits of portfolios to investors  the work of William Sharpe         John Lintner        and Jack Treynor        demonstrated the role that portfolios  play in determining the appropriate individual asset risk premium  i e  the return in  excess of the risk  free return expected by investors as compensation for the asset s  risk   According to capital market theory the priced risk of an individual security is  affected by holding it in a well  diversified portfolio  The early research provided the  insight that an asset s risk should be measured in relation to the remaining systematic  or non  diversifiable risk  which should be the only risk that affects the asset s price   This view of risk is the basis of the capital asset pricing model or CAPM which is  discussed in greater detail in other readings   Although MPT has limitations  the  concepts and intuitions illustrated in the theory continue to be the foundation of  knowledge for portfolio managers  
5,216,INVESTMENT CLIENTS
6,216,Portfolio managers are employed or contracted by a wide variety of investment clients    We can group the clients into categories based on their distinctive characteristics  and needs   Our initial distinction is between management of the private wealth of  individual investors and investment management for institutional investors  
7,216,    Individual Investors
8,216,Individual investors have a variety of motives for investing and constructing port  folios   Short  term goals can include providing for children s education saving for a  major purchase  such as a vehicle or a house  or starting a business   The retirement  goal investing to provide for an income in retirement is a major part of the invest  ment planning of most individuals   Many employees of public and private companies  invest for retirement through defined contribution pension plans  DC plans   A DC  plan is a pension plan in which contributions rather than benefits are specified such  as     k  plans in the United States  group personal pension schemes in the United  Kingdom and superannuation plans in Australia   Individuals will invest part of their  wages while working  expecting to draw on the accumulated funds to provide income  during retirement or to transfer some of their wealth to their heirs   The key to a DC  plan is that the employee accepts the investment risk and is responsible for ensuring  that there are enough funds in the plan to meet their needs upon retirement   Some individuals will be investing for growth and will therefore seek assets that  have the potential for capital gains   Others  such as retirees  may need to draw an  income from their assets and may therefore choose to invest in fixed  income and  dividend  paying shares   The investment needs of individuals will depend in part on  their broader financial circumstances  such as their employment prospects and whether  or not they own their own residence  They may also need to consider such issues as  building up a cash reserve and the purchase of appropriate insurance policies before  undertaking longer  term investments

32,217,      Defined Benefit Pension Plans
33,217,In defined benefit pension plans  DB plans  an employer has an obligation to pay  a certain annual amount to its employees when they retire  In other words  the future  benefit is defined because the DB plan requires the plan sponsor to specify the obliga  tion stated in terms of the retirement income benefits owed to participants   DB plans  need to invest the assets that will provide cash flows that match the timing of the future  pension payments  i e  liabilities   Plans are committed to paying pensions to members   and the assets of these plans are there to fund those payments   Plan managers need  to ensure that sufficient assets will be available to pay pension benefits as they come  due  The plan may have an indefinitely long time horizon if new plan members are  being admitted or a finite time horizon if the plan has been closed to new members    Even a plan closed to new members may still have a time horizon of    or    years   For  example a plan member aged    may not retire for another    years and may live     years in retirement   Hence pension plans can be considered long  term investors   In  some cases  the plan managers attempt to match the fund s assets to its liabilities by  for example investing in bonds that will produce cash flows corresponding to expected  future pension payments   There may be many different investment philosophies for  pension plans  depending on funded status and other variables

18,219,A typical investment objective of an endowment or a foundation is to maintain  the real  inflation  adjusted  capital value of the fund while generating income to fund  the objectives of the institution  Most foundations and endowments are established  with the intent of having perpetual lives   Example   describes the US    billion Yale  University endowment s approach to balancing short  term spending needs with  ensuring that future generations also benefit from the endowment  and it also shows  the      billion Wellcome Trust s approach  The investment approach undertaken  considers the objectives and constraints of the institution  for example no tobacco  investments for a medical endowment

20,219,Spending Rules
21,219,The following examples of spending rules are from the Yale University endowment   in the United States  and from the Wellcome Trust  in the United Kingdom  
22,219,Yale University Endowment
23,219,The spending rule is at the heart of fiscal discipline for an endowed  institution  Spending policies define an institution s compromise  between the conflicting goals of providing substantial support for  current operations and preserving purchasing power of Endowment  assets   The spending rule must be clearly defined and consistently  applied for the concept of budget balance to have meaning   Yale s policy is designed to meet two competing objectives   The  first goal is to release substantial current income to the operating  budget in a stable stream since large fluctuations in revenues are  difficult to accommodate through changes in University activities  or programs   The second goal is to protect the value of Endowment  assets against inflation allowing programs to be supported at today  s  level far into the future 
1,220,   
2,220,Reading      Portfolio Management  An Overview
3,220,Yale s spending rule attempts to achieve these two objectives  by using a long  term spending rate of       percent combined with  a smoothing rule that adjusts spending gradually to changes in  Endowment market value  The amount released under the spending  rule is based on a weighted average of prior spending adjusted for  inflation     percent weight  and an amount determined by applying  the target rate to the current Endowment market value     percent  weight  with an adjustment factor based on inflation and the expected  growth of the Endowment net of spending

5,220,Wellcome Trust
6,220,Our overall investment objective is to generate   percent real return  over the long term  This is to provide for real increases in annual  expenditure while preserving at least the Trust s capital base in real  terms in order to balance the needs of both current and future ben  eficiaries   We use this absolute return strategy because it aligns asset  allocation with funding requirements and it provides a competitive  framework in which to judge individual investments

8,220,      Banks
9,220,Banks typically accept deposits and extend loans   In some cases  banks need to invest  their excess reserves   i e  when deposits have not been used to make loans   The  investments of excess reserves need to be conservative emphasizing fixed  income  and money market instruments rather than equities and other riskier assets   In some  countries  including the United States  there are legal restrictions on banks owning  equity investments     In addition to low risk  the investments also need to be relatively  liquid so that they can be sold quickly if depositors wish to withdraw their funds   The  bank s objective is to earn a return on its reserves that exceeds the rate of interest it  pays on its deposits  
10,220,      Insurance Companies
11,220,Insurance companies receive premiums for the policies they write and they need  to invest these premiums in a manner that will allow them to pay claims   Similar  to banks  such investments need to be relatively conservative given the necessity of  paying claims when due  Life insurance companies and non  life insurance companies   for example auto and home insurance  differ in their purpose and objectives and  hence in their investment time horizons   Life insurance companies have longer time  horizons than non  life insurance companies as a result of different expectations of  when payments will be required under policies

4,221,Investment companies that manage mutual funds are also institutional investors   The  mutual fund is a collective financial institution in which investors pool their capital  to have it invested by a professional manager  The investors own shares or units in  the fund  For many investment managers  the mutual fund is  in effect  their client    However mutual funds are slightly different in that they can also be considered a  financial product  For many individual investors  the mutual fund is an efficient means  to benefit from portfolio diversification and the skill of a professional manager  The  mutual fund is likely to invest in a particular category of investments  such as US small  capitalization equities   Mutual funds may also have certain limits and restrictions  that apply to their investments  either as set by regulation and law or as decided by  the board of directors of the investment company  We will revisit these investment  vehicles in greater detail when we discuss pooled investments in Section

1,223,Steps in the Portfolio Management Process
2,223,   
3,223,the performance of the investments and whether objectives have been met   The IPS  should be reviewed and updated regularly  for example either every three years or  when a major change in a client s objectives  constraints  or circumstances occurs  
4,223,    Step Two  The Execution Step
5,223,The next step is for the portfolio manager to construct a suitable portfolio based on  the IPS of the client   The portfolio execution step consists of first deciding on a target  asset allocation which determines the weighting of asset classes to be included in the  portfolio  This step is followed by the analysis  selection and purchase of individual  investment securities  
6,223,      Asset Allocation
7,223,The next step in the process is to assess the risk and return characteristics of the  available investments   The analyst forms economic and capital market expectations  that can be used to form a proposed allocation of asset classes suitable for the client    Decisions that need to be made in the asset allocation of the portfolio include the  distribution between equities  fixed  income securities  and cash  sub  asset classes   such as corporate and government bonds   and geographical weightings within asset  classes   Alternative assets such as real estate commodities  hedge funds  and private  equity may also be included  Economists and market strategists may set the top down view on economic con  ditions and broad market trends   The returns on various asset classes are likely to be  affected by economic conditions   for example equities may do well when economic  growth has been unexpectedly strong whereas bonds may do poorly if inflation  increases   The economists and strategists will attempt to forecast these conditions  
8,223,Top down A top   down analysis begins with consideration of macroeconomic con  ditions  Based on the current and forecasted economic environment analysts evaluate  markets and industries with the purpose of investing in those that are expected to per form  well  Finally specific companies within these industries are considered for investment 
9,223,Bottom up rather than emphasizing economic cycles or industry analysis a bottom  up  analysis focuses on company  specific circumstances such as management quality and  business prospects  It is less concerned with broad economic trends than is the case for  top   down analysis but instead focuses on company specifics 
10,223,      Security Analysis
11,223,The top  down view can be combined with the bottom  up insights of security analysts  who are responsible for identifying attractive investments in particular market sectors    They will use their detailed knowledge of the companies and industries they cover to  assess the expected level and risk of the cash flows that each security will produce   This knowledge allows the analysts to assign a valuation to the security and identify  preferred investments  
12,223,      Portfolio Construction
13,223,The portfolio manager will then construct the portfolio taking account of the target  asset allocation security analysis  and the client s requirements as set out in the IPS   A key objective will be to achieve the benefits of diversification  i e  to avoid putting  all the eggs in one basket   Decisions need to be taken on asset class weightings  sector  weightings within an asset class  and the selection and weighting of individual securities

2,224,Reading      Portfolio Management  An Overview
3,224,or assets   The relative importance of these decisions on portfolio performance depends  at least in part on the investment strategy selected  for example consider an investor  that actively adjusts asset sector weights in relation to forecasts of sector performance  and one who does not  Although all decisions have an effect on portfolio performance  the asset allocation decision is commonly viewed as having the greatest impact   Exhibit     shows the broad portfolio weights of the endowment funds of Yale  University and the University of Virginia as of June       As you can see the portfolios  have a heavy emphasis on such alternative assets as hedge funds  private equity and  real estate Yale University particularly so

13,224,Risk management is an important part of the portfolio construction process   The  client s risk tolerance will be set out in the IPS and the portfolio manager must make  sure the portfolio is consistent with it   As noted above the manager will take a diver  sified portfolio perspective  What is important is not the risk of any single investment  but rather how all the investments perform as a portfolio  The endowments shown above are relatively risk tolerant investors   Contrast  the asset allocation of the endowment funds with the portfolio mix of the insurance  companies shown in Exhibit      You will notice that the majority of the insurance  assets are invested in fixed  income investments  typically of high quality  Note that  the Yale University portfolio has only    percent invested in fixed income with the  remainder invested in such growth assets as equity real estate and hedge funds   This  allocation is in sharp contrast to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company   MassMutual  portfolio which is over    percent invested in bonds  mortgages  loans   and cash reflecting the differing risk tolerance and constraints  life insurers face  regulatory constraints on their investments

12,225,The portfolio construction phase also involves trading   Once the portfolio man  ager has decided which securities to buy and in what amounts  the securities must be  purchased  In many investment firms  the portfolio manager will pass the trades to a  buy  side trader a colleague who specializes in securities trading who will contact  a stockbroker or dealer to have the trades executed 
13,225,Sell  side firm A broker or dealer that sells securities to and provides independent  investment research and recommendations to investment management companies 
14,225,Buy  side firm  Investment management companies and other investors that use the  services of brokers or dealers  i e  the clients of the sell  side firms  
15,225,    Step Three  The Feedback Step
16,225,Finally the feedback step assists the portfolio manager in rebalancing the portfolio  due to a change in for example market conditions or the circumstances of the client  
17,225,      Portfolio Monitoring and Rebalancing
18,225,Once the portfolio has been constructed it needs to be monitored and reviewed and  the composition revised as the security analysis changes because of changes in security  prices and changes in fundamental factors   When security and asset weightings have  drifted from the intended levels as a result of market movements  some rebalancing  may be required  The portfolio may also need to be revised if it becomes apparent  that the client s needs or circumstances have changed

4,226,      Performance Evaluation and Reporting
5,226,Finally the performance of the portfolio must be evaluated which will include assessing  whether the client s objectives have been met   For example the investor will wish to  know whether the return requirement has been achieved and how the portfolio has  performed relative to any benchmark that has been set   Analysis of performance may  suggest that the client s objectives need to be reviewed and perhaps changes made to  the IPS  As we will discuss in the next section there are numerous investment prod  ucts that clients can use to meet their investment needs   Many of these products are  diversified portfolios that an investor can purchase 
6,226,POOLED INVESTMENTS
7,226,The challenge faced by all investors is finding the right set of investment products to  meet their needs   Just as there are many different types of investment management  clients  there is a diverse set of investment products available to investors   These vary  from a simple brokerage account in which the individual creates her own portfolio  by assembling individual securities  to large institutions that hire individual portfolio  managers for all or part of their investment management needs   Although the array of  products is staggering  there are some general categories of pooled investment products  that represent the full range of what is available  At one end are mutual funds and  exchange traded funds in which investors can participate with a small initial invest  ment   At the other end are hedge funds and private equity funds  which might require  a minimum investment of US   million or more  In this context  the amount of funds  that an individual or institution can commit to a particular product has a significant  impact on which products are available  Exhibit    provides a general breakdown of  what investment products are available to investors based on investable funds

16,226,Rather than assemble a portfolio on their own individual investors and institutions  can turn over the selection and management of their investment portfolio to a third  party  One alternative is a mutual fund  This type of fund is a comingled investment  pool in which investors in the fund each have a pro  rata claim on the income and  value of the fund  The value of a mutual fund is referred to as the  net asset value   It  is computed daily based on the closing price of the securities in the portfolio  At the  end of the third quarter of        the Investment Company Institute reported over

11,227,Mutual funds are one of the most important investment vehicles for individuals  and institutions   The best way to understand how a mutual fund works is to consider  a simple example  Suppose that an investment firm wishes to start a mutual fund with  a target amount of US    million  It is able to reach this goal through investments  from five individuals and two institutions   The investment of each is as follows

3,228,Based on the US    million value  net asset value  the investment firm sets a total  of        shares at an initial value of US     per share  US    million            US       The investment firm will appoint a portfolio manager to be responsible for  the investment of the US    million  Going forward the total value of the fund or  net asset value will depend on the value of the assets in the portfolio  The fund can be set up as an open  end fund or a closed  end fund  If it is an  open  end fund it will accept new investment money and issue additional shares at a  value equal to the net asset value of the fund at the time of investment   For example  assume that at a later date the net asset value of the fund increases to US      mil  lion and the new net asset value per share is US      A new investor F wishes to  invest US      million in the fund  If the total value of the assets in the fund is now  US    million or US     per share in order to accommodate the new investment the  fund would create       US      million US      new shares   After this investment   the net asset value of the fund would be US       million and there would be a total  of        shares   Funds can also be withdrawn at the net asset value per share  Suppose on the same  day Investor E wishes to withdraw all her shares in the mutual fund  To accommo  date this withdrawal the fund will have to liquidate US     million in assets to retire       shares at a net asset value of US     per share  US     million US       The  combination of the inflow and outflow on the same day would be as follows

9,228,               
10,228,The net of the inflows and outflows on that day would be US        of new  funds to be invested and      new shares created  However the number of shares  held and the value of the shares of all remaining investors  except Investor E  would  remain the same  An alternative to setting the fund up as an open  end fund would be to create a  closed  end fund in which no new investment money is accepted into the fund  New  investors invest by buying existing shares  and investors in the fund liquidate by  selling their shares to other investors   Hence the number of outstanding shares does  not change  One consequence of this fixed share base is that  unlike open  end funds  in which new shares are created and sold at the current net asset value per share  closed  end funds can sell for a premium or discount to net asset value depending on  the demand for the shares   There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of fund  The open  end fund  structure makes it easy to grow in size but creates pressure on the portfolio manager  to manage the cash inflows and outflows   One consequence of this structure is the  need to liquidate assets that the portfolio manager might not want to sell at the time  to meet redemptions   Conversely the inflows require finding new assets in which to  invest   As such open  end funds tend not to be fully invested but rather keep some  cash for redemptions not covered by new investments   Closed  end funds do not  have these problems  but they do have a limited ability to grow  Of the total net asset  value of all US mutual funds at the end of       US     trillion  only approximately    percent were in the form of closed  end funds   In addition to open  end or closed  end funds  mutual funds can be classified as  load or no  load funds   The primary difference between the two is whether the investor  pays a sales charge  a  load   to purchase hold or redeem shares in the fund  In the  case of the no  load fund there is no fee for investing in the fund or for redemption  but there is an annual fee based on a percentage of the fund s net asset value  Load  funds are funds in which in addition to the annual fee a percentage fee is charged

3,229,to invest in the fund and or for redemptions from the fund  In addition load funds  are usually sold through retail brokers who receive part of the upfront fee  Overall  the number and importance of load funds has declined over time  Mutual funds also differ in terms of the type of assets that they invest in  Broadly  speaking  there are four different types of funds that are differentiated by broad asset  type  stock funds  domestic and international  bond funds  taxable and non  taxable   hybrid or balanced funds  combination of stocks and bonds  and money market funds   taxable and non  taxable   The approximately US      trillion in US mutual fund net  asset value by asset type as of the end of      is shown in Exhibit     A breakdown  for the European mutual fund market is shown in Exhibit

22,230,Stock and money market funds make up the largest segments of the US mutual  fund industry  Between      and      however there was a dramatic shift in the rel   ative proportion of net asset value in stock funds and money market funds   Although  there was a significant increase in the total value of assets in money market funds      percent  or approximately US     billion  the biggest change was in the value of  total assets of stock funds  which fell by    percent or approximately US     trillion   Close to     percent of this drop or US      billion was the result of redemptions  exceeding new investments  with the remaining of the decline attributed to the dra  matic fall in share prices during         A similar drop in equity assets is evident in  the European data  
23,230,    Types of Mutual Funds
24,230,The following section introduces the major types of mutual funds differentiated by the  asset type that they invest in  money market funds  bond mutual funds  stock mutual  funds  and hybrid or balanced funds  
25,230,      Money Market Funds
26,230,Although money market funds have been a substitute for bank savings accounts since  the early     s  they are not insured in the same way as bank deposits   At the end of       the total net asset value of US money market funds was in excess of US     tril  lion with a further    trillion in European money market funds   In the United States 
27,230,   These figures were extracted from data in Investment Company Institute      a  
1,231,Pooled Investments
2,231,   
3,231,there are two basic types of money market funds   taxable and tax  free  Taxable money  market funds invest in high  quality short  term corporate debt and federal government  debt   Tax  free money market funds invest in short  term state and local government  debt   At the end of      in the United States  there were approximately     taxable  funds with about US      trillion in net asset value and approximately     tax  free  money market funds with a total net asset value of about US      billion  From an  investor  s point of view these funds are essentially cash holdings   As such the pre  sumption of investors is that the net asset value of a money market fund is always  US      per share  In September       two large money market funds  broke the buck   that is  the  net asset value of the shares fell below US      per share  This drop in value caused  investors to question the safety of money market funds and resulted in a massive out  flow of funds from money market funds   This outflow continued until the US Federal  Reserve intervened to provide short  term insurance for some money market funds    This insurance although similar to bank deposits  was limited in scope and time 
4,231,      Bond Mutual Funds
5,231,A bond mutual fund is an investment fund consisting of a portfolio of individual  bonds and occasionally preferred shares   The net asset value of the fund is the sum  of the value of each bond in the portfolio divided by the number of shares   Investors  in the mutual fund hold shares  which account for their pro  rata share or interest  in the portfolio  The advantage is that an investor can invest in a bond fund for as  little as US     which provides a stake in a diversified bond portfolio in which each  individual bond may cost between US       and US         The major difference  between a bond mutual fund and a money market fund is the maturity of the under  lying assets   In a money market fund the maturity is as short as overnight and rarely  longer than    days   A bond mutual fund however holds bonds with maturities as  short as one year and as long as    years   Exhibit    illustrates the general categories  of bond mutual funds

16,232,      Stock Mutual Funds
17,232,Historically the largest types of mutual funds based on market value of assets under  management are stock or equity funds   At the end of the third quarter of      the  worldwide investment in stock mutual funds totaled around US      trillion with  approximately US   trillion of that in US stock mutual funds   There are two types of stock mutual funds   The first is an actively managed fund  in which the portfolio manager seeks outstanding performance through the selec  tion of the appropriate stocks to be included in the portfolio  Passive management is  followed by index funds that are very different from actively managed funds   Their  goal is to match or track the performance of different indexes   The first index fund  was introduced in      by the Vanguard Group  At the end of      index funds held  approximately    percent of the total net asset value of stock mutual funds     There are several major differences between actively managed funds and index  funds   First  management fees for actively managed funds are higher than for index  funds   The higher fees for actively managed funds reflect its goal to outperform an  index  whereas the index fund simply aims to match the return on the index   Higher  fees are required to pay for the research conducted to actively select securities   A  second difference is that the level of trading in an actively managed fund is much  higher than in an index fund which has obvious tax implications   Mutual funds are  required to distribute all income and capital gains realized in the portfolio so the  actively managed fund tends to have more opportunity to realize capital gains   This  results in higher taxes relative to an index fund which uses a buy  and  hold strategy   Consequently there is less buying and selling in an index fund and less likelihood of  realizing capital gains distributions  
18,232,      Hybrid Balanced Funds
19,232,Hybrid or balanced funds are mutual funds that invest in both bonds and shares    These types of funds represent a small fraction of the total investment in US mutual  funds but are more common in Europe   See Exhibits    and      These types of funds   however are gaining popularity with the growth of lifecycle funds   These are funds that  manage the asset mix based on a desired retirement date  For example if an investor  was    years old in      and planned to retire at the age of    he could invest in a  mutual fund with a target date of      and the fund would manage the appropriate
20,232,   Mamudi

2,233,   
3,233,asset mix over the next    years   In      it might be    percent invested in shares and     percent in bonds   As time passes  however the fund would gradually change the  mix of shares and bonds to reflect the appropriate mix given the time to retirement  
4,233,    Other Investment Products
5,233,In addition to mutual funds  a number of pooled investment products are increasingly  popular in meeting the individual needs of clients   The following section introduces  these products   exchange traded funds  separately managed accounts  hedge funds 
6,233,and buyout and venture capital funds 
7,233,      Exchange Traded Funds  
8,233,Exchange traded funds  ETFs  combine features of closed  end and open  end mutual  funds   ETFs trade like closed  end mutual funds   however like open  end funds  ETFs   prices track net asset value due to an innovative redemption procedure  ETFs are  created by fund sponsors who determine which securities will be included in the  basket of securities   To obtain the basket  the fund sponsors contact an institutional  investor who deposits the securities with the fund sponsor  In return the institutional  investor receives creation units that typically represent between       and         ETF shares   These shares can then be sold to the public by the institutional investor   The institutional investor can redeem the securities held in the ETF by returning  the number of shares in the original creation unit   This process prevents meaningful  premiums or discounts from net asset value  Closed  end mutual funds are predomi  nantly actively managed stock or bond funds whereas ETFs are typically index funds    The first ETF was created in the United States in      and in      in Europe  At the  end of      there were nearly      ETFs available in the United States with a total  net asset value of over US   trillion  A breakdown of the types of ETFs traded in the  United States is shown in Exhibit     The major difference between an index mutual fund and an ETF is that an investor  investing in an index mutual fund buys the fund shares directly from the fund and all  investments are settled at the net asset value  In the case of an ETF however investors  buy the shares from other investors just as if they were buying or selling shares of  stock   This setup includes the opportunity to short the shares or even purchase the  shares on margin  The price an investor pays is based on the prevailing price at the  time the transaction was made  This price may or may not be equal to the net asset  value at the time but it represents the price at that time for a willing buyer and seller   In practice the market price of the ETF is likely to be close to the net asset value of  the underlying investments   Other main differences between an index mutual fund and an index ETF are trans  action costs  transaction price treatment of dividends  and the minimum investment  amount   Expenses are lower for ETFs but  unlike mutual funds  investors do incur  brokerage costs   Also as noted above all purchases and redemptions in a mutual  fund take place at the same price at the close of business   ETFs are constantly traded  throughout the business day and as such each purchase or sale takes place at the  prevailing market price at that time  In the case of the ETF dividends are paid out to  the shareholders whereas index mutual funds usually reinvest the dividends   Hence  there is a direct cash flow from the ETF that is not there with the index mutual fund   Depending on the investor this cash flow may or may not be desirable  Note that the  tax implications are the same with either fund type  Finally the minimum required  investment in an ETF is usually smaller  Investors can purchase as little as one share  in an ETF which is usually not the case with an index mutual fund

1,235,Pooled Investments
2,235,   
3,235,ETFs are often cited as having tax advantages over index mutual funds   The advan  tage is not related to the dividends but rather to capital gains   As long as there is no  sale of assets in either fund no taxable capital gains would be realized by investors    It is possible however that because of the flow of funds into and out of index mutual  funds  these funds would have a greater likelihood of generating taxable capital gains  for investors   Overall it is not clear how much of an advantage there is or if there is  any advantage at all 
4,235,      Separately Managed Accounts
5,235,A fund management service for institutions or individual investors with substantial  assets is the separately managed account  SMA  which is also commonly referred  to as a  managed account    wrap account   or  individually managed account   An  SMA is an investment portfolio managed exclusively for the benefit of an individual or  institution  The account is managed by an individual investment professional to meet  the specific needs of the client in relation to investment objectives  risk tolerance and  tax situation  In an SMA  the individual shares are held directly by the investor   and  in return for annual fees  an individual can receive personalized investment advice  The key difference between an SMA and a mutual fund is that the assets are owned  directly by the individual  Therefore unlike a mutual fund the investor has control  over which assets are bought and sold and the timing of the transactions   Moreover  in a mutual fund there is no consideration given to the tax position of the individual  asset   In an SMA  the transactions can take into account the specific tax needs of the  investor  The main disadvantage of an SMA is that the required minimum investment  is usually much higher than is the case with a mutual fund  Usually the minimum  investment is between US        and US         Large institutions often use segregated accounts  which means their investments are  held in an account on their behalf and managed by a portfolio manager or team  They  can also use mutual funds   The decision on which approach to take often depends on  the value of assets involved  Larger amounts of assets are more likely to be managed  on a segregated basis  
6,235,      Hedge Funds
7,235,The origin of hedge funds   can be traced back as far as      to a fund managed by  A  W  Jones   Co  It offered a strategy of a non  correlated offset to the  long  only    position typical of most portfolios   From this start emerged a whole new industry  of hedge funds   Hedge fund strategies generally involve a significant amount of risk   driven in large measure by the liberal use of leverage and complexity  They also often  involve the extensive use of derivatives   A key difference between hedge funds and mutual funds is that the vast majority  of hedge funds are exempt from many of the reporting requirements for the typical  public investment company  In the United States  investment companies do not have  to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  if they have      or fewer investors  Section   c   of the Investment Company Act of       or if the  investor base is greater than     but less than      qualified purchasers     Section    c   of the Investment Company Act of        In order to qualify for the exemption  hedge funds cannot be offered for sale to the general public  they can only be sold via  private placement   In addition Regulation D of the Securities Act of      requires

3,237,      Buyout and Venture Capital Funds
4,237,Two areas that have grown considerably over the last    years have been buyout and  venture capital funds   Both take equity positions but in different types of companies    An essential feature of both is that they are not passive investors  and as such they  play a very active role in the management of the company  Furthermore the equity  they hold is private rather than traded on public markets   In addition neither intends  to hold the equity for the long term  from the beginning  both plan for an exit strategy  that will allow them to liquidate their positions   Both venture capital funds and private  equity funds operate in a manner similar to hedge funds   A minimum investment is  required there is limited liquidity during some fixed time period and management  fees are based not only on funds under management but also on the performance of  the fund  Buyout Funds The essence of a buyout fund is that it buys all the shares of a public  company and by holding all the shares  the company becomes private  The early lev  eraged buyouts  LBOs  of the mid      s through the early     s created the modern  private equity firm  These were highly levered transactions that used the company  s  cash flow to pay down the debt and build the equity position  In its current form pri  vate equity firms raise money specifically for the purpose of buying public companies   converting them to private companies  and simultaneously restructuring the com  pany  The purchase is usually financed through a significant increase in the amount of  debt issued by the company  A typical financing would include    percent equity and     percent debt in one form or another  The high level of debt is also accompanied by  a restructuring of the operations of the company  The key is to increase the cash flow   Most private equity funds do not intend to hold the company for the long run because  their goal is to exit the investment in three to five years either through an initial public  offering  IPO  or a sale to another company  Generally a private equity firm makes a  few very large investments   Venture Capital Funds Venture capital differs from a buyout fund in that a venture  capital firm does not buy established companies but rather provides financing for  companies in their start  up phase  Venture capital funds play a very active role in the  management of the companies in which they invest   beyond just providing money  they provide close oversight and advice  Similar to buyout funds  venture capital funds  typically have a finite investment horizon and depending on the type of business make  the investment with the intent to exit in three to five years   These funds make a large  number of small investments with the expectation that only a small number will pay  off  The assumption is that the one that does pay off pays off big enough to compensate  for the ones that do not pay off

6,237,   In this reading we have discussed how a portfolio approach to investing could  be preferable to simply investing in individual securities      The problem with focusing on individual securities is that this approach may  lead to the investor  putting all her eggs in one basket       Portfolios provide important diversification benefits  allowing risk to be reduced  without necessarily affecting or compromising return

10,242,Construction of an optimal portfolio is an important objective for an investor  In this  reading  we will explore the process of examining the risk and return characteristics of  individual assets  creating all possible portfolios  selecting the most efficient portfolios   and ultimately choosing the optimal portfolio tailored to the individual in question  During the process of constructing the optimal portfolio several factors and invest  ment characteristics are considered  The most important of those factors are risk and  return of the individual assets under consideration  Correlations among individual  assets along with risk and return are important determinants of portfolio risk   Creating  a portfolio for an investor requires an understanding of the risk profile of the investor

4,243,Although we will not discuss the process of determining risk aversion for individuals  or institutional investors  it is necessary to obtain such information for making an  informed decision  In this reading  we will explain the broad types of investors and  how their risk return preferences can be formalized to select the optimal portfolio  from among the infinite portfolios contained in the investment opportunity set   The reading is organized as follows   Section   discusses the investment charac  teristics of assets   In particular we show the various types of returns and risks  their  computation and their applicability to the selection of appropriate assets for inclusion  in a portfolio  Section   discusses risk aversion and how indifference curves  which  incorporate individual preferences  can be constructed  The indifference curves are  then applied to the selection of an optimal portfolio using two risky assets   Section    provides an understanding and computation of portfolio risk   The role of correlation  and diversification of portfolio risk are examined in detail  Section   begins with the  risky assets available to investors and constructs a large number of risky portfolios   It  illustrates the process of narrowing the choices to an efficient set of risky portfolios  before identifying the optimal risky portfolio  The risky portfolio is combined with  investor risk preferences to generate the optimal risky portfolio  A summary concludes  this reading  
5,243,INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSETS
6,243,Financial assets are generally defined by their risk and return characteristics  Comparison  along these two dimensions simplifies the process of selecting from millions of assets  and makes financial assets substitutable  These characteristics distinguish financial  assets from physical assets  which can be defined along multiple dimensions   For  example wine is characterized by its grapes  aroma  sweetness  alcohol content   and age among other factors   The price of a television depends on picture quality  manufacturer screen size number and quality of speakers  and so on none of which  are similar to the characteristics for wine  Therein lies one of the biggest differences  between financial and physical assets   Although financial assets are generally claims  on real assets  their commonality across two dimensions  risk and return  simplifies  the issue and makes them easier to value than real assets   In this section we will  compute evaluate and compare various measures of return and risk  
7,243,    Return
8,243,Financial assets normally generate two types of return for investors   First  they may  provide periodic income through cash dividends or interest payments   Second the  price of a financial asset can increase or decrease leading to a capital gain or loss   Certain financial assets  through design or choice provide return through only  one of these mechanisms   For example investors in non  dividend  paying stocks   such as Google or Baidu obtain their return from capital appreciation only  Similarly  you could also own or have a claim to assets that only generate periodic income  For  example defined benefit pension plans  retirement annuities  and reverse mortgages   make income payments as long as you live 
9,243,  A reverse mortgage is a type of loan that allows individuals to convert part of their home equity into  cash  The loan is usually disbursed in a stream of payments made to the homeowner by the lender  As long  as the homeowner lives in the home they need not be repaid during the lifetime of the homeowner  The  loan however can be paid off at any time by the borrower not necessarily by selling the home

3,244,You should be aware that returns reported for stock indexes are sometimes mis  leading because most index levels only capture price appreciation and do not adjust  for cash dividends unless the stock index is labeled  total return  or  net dividends  reinvested   For example as reported by Yahoo  Finance the S P     Index of US  stocks was at        on    December        Similarly Yahoo  Finance reported that  the index closed on    July       at        implying a return of close to    percent  over the approximately six  and  a half  year period  The results are very different   however if the total return S P     Index is considered  The index was at          on    July      and had risen      percent to         on    December      giving  an annual return of      percent   The difference in the two calculations arises from  the fact that index levels reported by Yahoo  Finance and other reporting agencies do  not include cash dividends  which are an important part of the total return  Thus  it  is important to recognize and account for income from investments   In the following subsection we consider various types of returns  their computa  tion and their application 
4,244,      Holding Period Return
5,244,Returns can be measured over a single period or over multiple periods   Single period  returns are straightforward because there is only one way to calculate them  Multiple  period returns  however can be calculated in various ways and it is important to be  aware of these differences to avoid confusion  A holding period return is the return earned from holding an asset for a single  specified period of time  The period may be   day   week    month   years  or any  specified period  If the asset  bond stock  etc   is bought now time  t      at a price  of     and sold later say at time t at a price of     with no dividends or other income  then the holding period return is   percent                     If the asset also pays  an income of   units at time t then the total return is   percent   This return can be  generalized and shown as a mathematical expression

45,244,In the above expression P is the price and D is the dividend  The subscript indi  cates the time of that price or dividend t     is the beginning of the period and t is  the end of the period  The following two observations are important      We computed a capital gain of   percent and a dividend yield of   percent in the  above example  For ease of illustration we assumed that the dividend is paid at  time t  If the dividend was received any time before t our holding period return  would have been higher because we would have earned a return by putting the  dividend in the bank for the remainder of the period     Return can be expressed in decimals        fractions         or as a percent        They are all equivalent   The holding period return can be computed for a period longer than one year  For  example you may need to compute a three  year holding period return from three  annual returns   In that case the holding period return is computed by compounding  the three annual returns   R         R          R          R        where R  R  and  R  are the three annual returns   In this and succeeding parts of Section     we consider the aggregation of several  single period returns

3,245,      Arithmetic or Mean Return
4,245,When assets have returns for multiple holding periods  it is necessary to aggregate  those returns into one overall return for ease of comparison and understanding   It  is also possible to compute the return for a long or an unusual holding period  Such  returns  however may be difficult to interpret   For example a return of     percent  earned by AstraZeneca PLC over the last    years       to       may not be meaningful  unless all other returns are computed for the same period  Therefore most holding  period returns are reported as daily monthly or annual returns   Aggregating returns across several holding periods becomes a challenge and can  lead to different conclusions depending on the method of aggregation  The remainder  of this section is designed to present various ways of computing average returns as  well as discussing their applicability  The simplest way to compute the return is to take the simple average of all holding  period returns   Thus  three annual returns of     percent     percent  and    percent  will give us an average of   percent per year     The arithmetic  return is easy to compute and has known statistical properties  such as standard  deviation  We can calculate the arithmetic return and its standard deviation to deter  mine how dispersed the observations are around the mean or if the mean return is  statistically different from zero  In general the arithmetic or mean return is denoted by Ri and given by the fol  lowing equation for asset i where Rit is the return in period t and T is the total number  of periods

44,245,      Geometric Mean Return
45,245,The arithmetic mean return is the average of the returns earned on a unit of invest  ment at the beginning of each holding period  It assumes that the amount invested  at the beginning of each period is the same similar to the concept of calculating  simple interest   However because the base amount changes each year  the previous  year  s earnings needs to be added to or  compounded  to the beginning value of the  investment  a holding or geometric period return may be quite different from the  return implied by the arithmetic return  The geometric mean return assumes that the  investment amount is not reset at the beginning of each year and in effect  accounts  for the compounding of returns   Basically the geometric mean reflects a  buy  and   hold  strategy whereas the arithmetic reflects a constant dollar investment at the  beginning of each time period  
46,245,  A buy  and  hold strategy assumes that the money invested initially grows or declines with time depend  ing on whether a particular period s return is positive or negative  On the one hand a geometric return  compounds the returns and captures changes in values of the initial amount invested  On the other hand  arithmetic return assumes that we start with the same amount of money every period without compounding  the return earned in a prior period

47,246,where Rit is the return in period t and T is the total number of periods   In the example in Section       we calculated the arithmetic mean to be   percent   Exhibit   shows the actual return for each year and the actual amount at the end of  each year using actual returns   Beginning with an initial investment of         we  will have         at the end of the three  year period as shown in the third column   Note that we compounded the returns because unless otherwise stated we receive  return on the amount at the end of the prior year  That is  we will receive a return of     percent in the second year on the amount at the end of the first year which is only          not the initial amount of          Let us compare the actual amount at the end  of the three  year period         with the amount we get using an annual arithmetic  mean return of   percent calculated above  The year  end amounts are shown in the  fourth column using the arithmetic return of   percent   At the end of the three  year  period    will be worth                             This ending amount of          is much larger than the actual amount of          Clearly the calculated arithmetic  return is greater than the actual return  In general the arithmetic return is biased  upward unless the actual holding period returns are equal  The bias in arithmetic mean  returns is particularly severe if holding period returns are a mix of both positive and  negative returns  as in the example  For our example and using the above formula  the geometric mean return per  year is       percent  compared with an arithmetic mean return of      percent   The  last column of Exhibit   shows that using the geometric return of      percent gener  ates a value of         at the end of the three  year period which is very close to the  actual value of          The small difference in ending values is the result of a slight  approximation used in computing the geometric return of      percent   Because of  the effect of compounding  the geometric mean return is always less than or equal to  the arithmetic mean return R  unless there is no variation in returns  in which  case they are equal

3,247,      Money  Weighted Return or Internal Rate of Return
4,247,The above return computations do not account for the amount of money invested  in different periods   It matters to an investor how much money was invested in each  of the three years   If she had invested        in the first year       in the second  year and       in the third year then the return of      percent in the first year  significantly hurts her  On the other hand if she had invested only      in the first  year the effect of the     percent return is drastically reduced  The money  weighted return accounts for the money invested and provides the  investor with information on the return she earns on her actual investment   The  money  weighted return and its calculation are similar to the internal rate of return  and the yield to maturity  Just like the internal rate of return amounts invested are  cash outflows from the investor  s perspective and amounts returned or withdrawn by  the investor or the money that remains at the end of an investment cycle is a cash  inflow for the investor  The money  weighted return can be illustrated most effectively with an example  In  this example we use the actual returns from the previous example  Assume that the  investor invests      in a mutual fund at the beginning of the first year adds another       at the beginning of the second year and withdraws      at the end of the second  year  The cash flows are shown in Exhibit

20,247,The internal rate of return is the discount rate at which the sum of present values  of these cash flows will equal zero  In general the equation may be expressed as fol  lows  where T is the number of periods  CFt is the cash flow at time t and IRR is the  internal rate of return or the money  weighted rate of return

32,247,A cash flow can be positive or negative  a positive cash flow is an inflow where  money flows to the investor whereas a negative cash flow is an outflow where money  flows away from the investor  We can compute the internal rate of return by using the  above equation  The flows are expressed as follows  where each cash inflow or outflow  occurs at the end of each year  Thus  CF  refers to the cash flow at the end of Year

55,248,IRR          is the internal rate of return or the money  weighted rate of return  which tells the investor what she earned on the actual euros invested for the entire  period  This return is much greater than the arithmetic and geometric mean returns  because only a small amount was invested when the mutual fund s return was      percent   Although the money  weighted return is an accurate measure of what the inves  tor actually earned on the money invested it is limited in its applicability to other  situations   For example it does not allow for return comparison between different  individuals or different investment opportunities   Two investors in the same mutual  fund may have different money  weighted returns because they invested different  amounts in different years  
56,248,      Comparison of Returns
57,248,The previous subsections have introduced a number of return measures   The following  example illustrates the computation comparison and applicability of each measure

3,250,For clarification it may be appropriate to explain the notation for cash flows    Each cash inflow or outflow occurs at the end of each year  Thus  CF  refers to  the cash flow at the end of Year   or beginning of Year   and CF  refers to the  cash flow at end of Year   or beginning of Year    Because cash flows are being  discounted to the present that is  end of Year   or beginning of Year   the  period of discounting CF  is zero whereas the period of discounting for CF  is    years   To get the exact money  weighted rate of return  IRR  the following equation  would be equal to zero  Instead of calculating  however use the   percent return  to see whether the value of the expression is positive or not   If it is positive then  the money  weighted rate of return is greater than   percent because a   percent  discount rate could not reduce the value to zero

39,250,Because the value is positive the money  weighted rate of return is greater  than    percent   Using a financial calculator the exact money  weighted rate of  return is      percent  
40,250,      Annualized Return
41,250,The period during which a return is earned or computed can vary and often we have  to annualize a return that was calculated for a period that is shorter  or longer  than  one year  You might buy a short  term treasury bill with a maturity of   months  or you  might take a position in a futures contract that expires at the end of the next quarter   How can we compare these returns  In many cases  it is most convenient to annualize  all available returns   Thus  daily weekly monthly and quarterly returns are converted  to an annual return  In addition many formulas used for calculating certain values  or prices may require all returns and periods to be expressed as annualized rates of  return  For example the most common version of the Black Scholes option  pricing  model requires annualized returns and periods to be in years   To annualize any return for a period shorter than one year the return for the  period must be compounded by the number of periods in a year  A monthly return is  compounded    times  a weekly return is compounded    times  and a quarterly return  is compounded   times   Daily returns are normally compounded     times   For an  uncommon number of days  we compound by the ratio of     to the number of days   If the weekly return is     percent  then the compound annual return is computed  as shown because there are    weeks in a year

48,251,One major limitation of annualizing returns is the implicit assumption that returns  can be repeated precisely that is  money can be reinvested repeatedly while earning  a similar return  This type of return is not always possible  An investor may earn a  return of    percent during a week because the market went up that week or he got  lucky with his stock  but it is highly unlikely that he will earn a return of    percent  every week for the next    weeks  resulting in an annualized return of         per  cent                 Therefore it is important to annualize short  term returns with  this limitation in mind  Annualizing returns  however allows for comparison among  different assets and over different time periods

4,252,      Portfolio Return
5,252,When several individual assets are combined into a portfolio we can compute the  portfolio return as a weighted average of the returns in the portfolio  The portfolio  return is simply a weighted average of the returns of the individual investments  or  assets   If Asset   has a return of    percent and constitutes    percent of the portfo  lio s investment  then the contribution to the portfolio return is   percent        of        In general if Asset i has a return of Ri and has a weight of wi in the portfolio  then the portfolio return RP is given as

26,252, 
27,252,Note that the weights must add up to   because the assets in a portfolio includ  ing cash must account for      percent of the investment   Also note that these are  single period returns  so there are no cash flows during the period and the weights  remain constant   A two  asset portfolio is easier to work with so we will use only two assets to  illustrate most concepts   Extending the analysis to multiple assets  however is easily  achieved and covered in later sections   With only two assets in the portfolio the port  folio return can be written as shown where w  and w  are weights in assets   and    RP   w R    w R  Because the portfolio consists of only two assets  the sum of the two weights should  equal      percent   Therefore w    w      or w         w    By substituting  we can  rewrite the above equation as follows   RP   w R         w  R 
28,252,    Other Major Return Measures and their Applications
29,252,The statistical measures of return discussed in the previous section are generally  applicable across a wide range of assets and time periods   Special assets  however  such as mutual funds  and other considerations  such as taxes or inflation may require  return measures that are specific to a particular application  Although it is not possible to consider all types of special applications  we will dis  cuss the effect of fees  gross versus net returns  taxes  pre  tax and after  tax returns   inflation  nominal and real returns  and leverage  Many investors use mutual funds  or other external entities  i e  investment vehicles  for investment   In those cases   funds charge management fees and expenses to the investors   Consequently gross and  net  of  fund  expense returns should also be considered  Of course an investor may be  interested in the net  of  expenses after  tax real return which is in fact what an investor  truly receives   We consider these additional return measures in the following sections  
30,252,      Gross and Net Return
31,252,A gross return is the return earned by an asset manager prior to deductions for manage  ment expenses  custodial fees  taxes  or any other expenses that are not directly related  to the generation of returns but rather related to the management and administration  of an investment   These expenses are not deducted from the gross return because  they may vary with the amount of assets under management or may vary because  of the tax status of the investor  Trading expenses  however such as commissions   are accounted for in  i e  deducted from  the computation of gross return because
1,253,   
2,253,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,253,trading expenses contribute directly to the return earned by the manager  Thus  gross  return is an appropriate measure for evaluating and comparing the investment skill of  asset managers because it does not include any fees related to the management and  administration of an investment   Net return is a measure of what the investment vehicle  mutual fund etc   has  earned for the investor  Net return accounts for  i e  deducts  all managerial and  administrative expenses that reduce an investor  s return  Because individual investors  are most concerned about the net return  i e  what they actually receive  small mutual  funds with a limited amount of assets under management are at a disadvantage com  pared with the larger funds that can spread their largely fixed administrative expenses  over a larger asset base  As a result  many small  sized mutual funds waive part of the  expenses to keep the funds competitive 
4,253,      Pre  tax and After  tax Nominal Return
5,253,All return measures discussed previously are pre  tax nominal returns that is  no  adjustment has been made for taxes or inflation  In general all returns are pre  tax  nominal returns unless they are otherwise designated  Investors are concerned about the tax liability of their returns because taxes reduce  the actual return that they receive  The two types of returns  capital gains  change in  price  and income  such as dividends or interest  are usually taxed differently  Capital  gains come in two forms   short  term capital gains and long  term capital gains   Long   term capital gains typically receive preferential tax treatment in a number of countries    Interest income is taxed as ordinary income in most countries   Dividend income may  be taxed as ordinary income may have a lower tax rate or may be exempt from taxes  depending on the country and the type of investor  The after  tax nominal return is  computed as the total return minus any allowance for taxes on realized gains    Because taxes are paid on realized capital gains and income the investment manager  can minimize the tax liability by selecting appropriate securities  e g   those subject  to more favorable taxation all other investment considerations equal  and reducing  trading turnover  Therefore many investors evaluate investment managers based on  the after  tax nominal return 
6,253,      Real Returns
7,253,A nominal return  r  consists of three components   a real risk  free return as com  pensation for postponing consumption  rrF  inflation as compensation for loss of  purchasing power     and a risk premium for assuming risk  RP   Thus  nominal  return and real return can be expressed as

30,253,   or
31,253,Often the real risk  free return and the risk premium are combined to arrive at the  real  risky   rate as given in the second equation above simply referred to as the real  return  Real returns are particularly useful in comparing returns across time periods  because inflation rates may vary over time  Real returns are also useful in comparing  returns among countries when returns are expressed in local currencies instead of  a constant investor currency in which inflation rates vary between countries  which  are usually the case   Finally the after  tax real return is what the investor receives as  compensation for postponing consumption and assuming risk after paying taxes on  investment returns   As a result the after  tax real return becomes a reliable benchmark
32,253,  Bonds issued at a discount to the par value may be taxed based on accrued gains instead of realized gains  
1,254,Investment Characteristics of Assets
2,254,   
3,254,for making investment decisions   Although it is a measure of an investor  s bench  mark return it is not commonly calculated by asset managers because it is difficult  to estimate a general tax component applicable to all investors   For example the tax  component depends on an investor  s specific taxation rate  marginal tax rate  how  long the investor holds an investment  long  term versus short  term  and the type of  account the asset is held in  tax  exempt  tax  deferred or normal  
4,254,      Leveraged Return
5,254,In the previous calculations  we have assumed that the investor  s position in an asset  is equal to the total investment made by an investor using his or her own money  This  section differs in that the investor creates a leveraged position  There are two ways  of creating a claim on asset returns that are greater than the investment of one s own  money  First  an investor may trade futures contracts in which the money required  to take a position may be as little as    percent of the notional value of the asset   In  this case the leveraged return the return on the investor  s own money is    times  the actual return of the underlying security  Note that both the gains and losses are  amplified by a factor of     Investors can also invest more than their own money by borrowing money to pur  chase the asset   This approach is easily done in stocks and bonds  and very common  when investing in real estate  If half     percent  of the money invested is borrowed  then the asset return to the investor is doubled but the investor must account for  interest to be paid on borrowed money 
6,254,EXAMPLE  
7,254,Computation of Special Returns
8,254,Let s return to Example     After reading this section Mr  Lohrmann decided  that he was not being fair to the fund manager by including the asset manage  ment fee and other expenses because the small size of the fund would put it at  a competitive disadvantage  He learns that the fund spends a fixed amount of          every year on expenses that are unrelated to the manager  s performance  Mr  Lohrmann has become concerned that both taxes and inflation may  reduce his return  Based on the current tax code he expects to pay    percent  tax on the return he earns from his investment   Historically inflation has been  around   percent and he expects the same rate of inflation to be maintained    Estimate the annual gross return for the first year by adding back the fixed  expenses     What is the net return that investors in the Rhein Valley Superior Fund  earned during the five  year period    What is the after  tax net return for the first year that investors earned  from the Rhein Valley Superior Fund  Assume that all gains are realized at  the end of the year and the taxes are paid immediately at that time    What is the anticipated after  tax real return that investors would have  earned in the fifth year 
9,254,Solution to   
10,254,The gross return for the first year is higher by      percent                        than the investor return reported by the fund  Thus  the gross return is       per  cent                 
1,255,   
2,255,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,255,Solution to   
4,255,The investor return reported by the mutual fund is the net return of the fund  after accounting for all direct and indirect expenses   The net return is also the  pre  tax nominal return because it has not been adjusted for taxes or inflation   The net return for the five  year holding period was       percent  
5,255,Solution to   
6,255,The net return earned by investors during the first year was    percent  Applying  a    percent tax rate the after  tax return that accrues to the investors is    per  cent                        
7,255,Solution to   
8,255,As in Part   the after  tax return earned by investors in the fifth year is     percent                        Inflation reduces the return by   percent so the after  tax  real return earned by investors in the fifth year is      percent  as shown

28,255,    Variance and Covariance of Returns
29,255,Having discussed the various kinds of returns in considerable detail we now turn to  measures of riskiness of those returns   Just like return there are various kinds of risk    For now we will consider the total risk of an asset or a portfolio of assets as measured  by its standard deviation which is the square root of variance 
30,255,      Variance of a Single Asset
31,255,Variance or risk  is a measure of the volatility or the dispersion of returns   Variance is  measured as the average squared deviation from the mean  Higher variance suggests  less predictable returns and therefore a more risky investment   The variance      of  asset returns is given by the following equation

47,255,where Rt is the return for period t T is the total number of periods  and   is the mean  of T returns  assuming T is the population of returns   If only a sample of returns is available instead of the population of returns  as is  usually the case in the investment world  then the above expression underestimates  the variance  The correction for sample variance is made by replacing the denominator  with  T      as shown next  where R is the mean return of the sample observations  and s  is the sample variance

39,256,      Variance of a Portfolio of Assets
40,256,Like a portfolio s return we can calculate a portfolio s variance  When computing  the variance of portfolio returns  standard statistical methodology can be used by  finding the variance of the full expression of portfolio return  Although the return  of a portfolio is simply a weighted average of the returns of each security this is not  the case with the standard deviation of a portfolio  unless all securities are perfectly  correlated that is  correlation equals one   Variance can be expressed more generally  for N securities in a portfolio using the notation from section       of this reading

75,257,The portfolio s expected return is        percent and the portfolio s risk is        percent   Look at this example closely  It shows that we can take the port  folio of a US investor invested only in the S P     combine it with a riskier  portfolio consisting of emerging markets securities  and the return of the US  investor increases from      percent to       percent while the risk of the port  folio actually falls from        percent to        percent   Exhibit    depicts how  the combination of the two assets results in a superior risk return trade  off   Not only does the investor get a higher return but he also gets it at a lower risk    That is the power of diversification as you will see later in this reading

33,258,    Historical Return and Risk
34,258,At this time it is beneficial to look at historical risk and returns for the three main  asset categories   stocks  bonds  and Treasury bills   Stocks refer to corporate owner  ship bonds refer to long  term fixed  income securities  and Treasury bills refer to  short  term government debt securities   Although there is generally no expectation  of default on government securities  long  term government bond prices are volatile   risky  because of possible future changes in interest rates   In addition bondholders  also face the risk that inflation will reduce the purchasing power of their cash flows  
35,258,      Historical Mean Return and Expected Return
36,258,Before examining historical data  it is useful to distinguish between the historical mean  return and expected return which are very different concepts but easy to confuse   Historical return is what was actually earned in the past whereas expected return is  what an investor anticipates to earn in the future  Expected return is the nominal return that would cause the marginal investor  to invest in an asset based on the real risk  free interest rate  rrF  expected inflation   E     and expected risk premium for the risk of the asset  E RP    The real risk  free  interest rate is expected to be positive as compensation for postponing consumption   Similarly the risk premium is expected to be positive in most cases    The expected  inflation rate is generally positive except when the economy is in a deflationary state
37,258,  There are exceptions when an asset reduces overall risk of a portfolio  We will consider those exceptions  in section     
1,259,   
2,259,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,259,and prices are falling   Thus  expected return is generally positive  The relationship  between the expected return and the real risk  free interest rate inflation rate and  risk premium can be expressed by the following equation      E R         rrF         E            E RP   The historical mean return for investment in a particular asset however is obtained  from the actual return that was earned by an investor  Because the investment is  risky there is no guarantee that the actual return will be equal to the expected return   In fact  it is very unlikely that the two returns are equal for a specific time period  being considered  Given a long enough period of time we can expect that the future   expected  return will equal the average historical return  Unfortunately we do not  know how long that period is    years     years  or     years   As a practical matter  we often assume that the historical mean return is an adequate representation of the  expected return although this assumption may not be accurate  For example Exhibit    shows that the historical equity returns in the last nine years             for large  US company stocks were negative whereas the expected return was nearly always  positive  Nonetheless  longer  term returns             were positive and could be  consistent with expected return  Though it is unknown if the historical mean returns  accurately represent expected returns  it is an assumption that is commonly made

28,259,Going forward be sure to distinguish between expected return and historical  mean return  We will alert the reader whenever historical returns are used to estimate  expected returns  
29,259,      Nominal Returns of Major US Asset Classes
30,259,We focus on three major asset categories in Exhibit     stocks  bonds  and T  bills    The mean nominal returns for US asset classes are reported decade by decade since  the     s   The total for the           period is in the last column  All returns are  annual geometric mean returns   Large company stocks had an overall annual return of      percent during the     year period  The return was negative in the     s and     s 
1,260,Investment Characteristics of Assets
2,260,   
3,260,and positive in all remaining decades   The     s and     s were the best decades for  large company stocks   Small company stocks fared even better  The nominal return  was never negative for any decade and had double  digit growth in all decades except  two leading to an overall     year annual return of      percent   Long  term corporate bonds and long  term government bonds earned overall  returns of     percent and     percent  respectively  The corporate bonds did not have  a single negative decade although government bonds recorded a negative return in  the     s when stocks were doing extremely well  Bonds also had some excellent  decades  earning double  digit returns in the     s and     s   Treasury bills  short  term government securities  did not earn a negative return  in any decade  In fact  Treasury bills earned a negative return only in             per  cent  when the inflation rate was        percent   Consistently positive returns for  Treasury bills are not surprising because nominal interest rates are almost never  negative and the Treasury bills suffer from little interest rate or inflation risk   Since  the Great Depression there has been no deflation in any decade although inflation  rates were highly negative in              percent               percent  and                percent   Conversely inflation rates were very high in the late     s and  early     s  reaching       percent in       Inflation rates have fallen since then to  a negligible level of       percent in       Overall the inflation rate was      percent  for the     year period 
4,260,      Real Returns of Major US Asset Classes
5,260,Because inflation rates can vary greatly from        percent to        percent in the  last    years  comparisons across various time periods is difficult and misleading using  nominal returns   Therefore it is more effective to rely on real returns   Real returns on  stocks  bonds  and T  bills are reported from      in Exhibits   and

4,262,      Risk of Major Asset Classes
5,262,Risk for major asset classes in the United States is reported for           in Exhibit    and the risk for major asset classes for the United States  the world and the world  excluding the United States are reported for           in Exhibit    Exhibit   shows  that US small company stocks had the highest risk       percent  followed by US large  company stocks       percent  Long  term government bonds and long  term corporate  bonds had lower risk at      percent and      percent  with Treasury bills having the  lowest risk at about     percent   Exhibit   shows that the risk for world stocks is      percent and for world bonds  is      percent   The world excluding the United States has risks of       percent for  stocks and      percent for bonds   The effect of diversification is apparent when world  risk is compared with US risk and world excluding US risk   Although the risk of US  stocks is      percent and the risk of world excluding US stocks is      percent  the  combination gives a risk of only      percent for world stocks   We can see a similar  impact for world bonds when compared with US bonds and world bonds excluding  US bonds   We observe a similar pattern in the risk levels of real returns  
6,262,      Risk Return Trade  off
7,262,The expression  risk return trade  off   refers to the positive relationship between  expected risk and return  In other words  a higher return is not possible to attain in  efficient markets and over long periods of time without accepting higher risk   Expected  returns should be greater for assets with greater risk   The historical data presented above show the risk return trade  off  Exhibit   shows  for the United States that small company stocks had higher risk and higher return  than large company stocks   Large company stocks had higher returns and higher  risk than both long  term corporate bonds and government bonds   Bonds had higher  returns and higher risk than Treasury bills   Uncharacteristically however long  term  government bonds had higher total risk than long  term corporate bonds  although  the returns of corporate bonds were slightly higher  These factors do not mean that  long  term government bonds had greater default risk  just that they were more variable  than corporate bonds during this historic period  Turning to real returns  we find the same pattern  Higher returns were earned  by assets with higher risk   Exhibit    reveals that the risk and return for stocks were  the highest of the asset classes  and the risk and return for bonds were lower than  stocks for the United States  the world and the world excluding the United States   US  Treasury bills had the lowest return and lowest risk among T  bills  bonds  and stocks   Another way of looking at the risk return trade  off is to focus on the risk pre   mium which is the extra return investors can expect for assuming additional risk   after accounting for the nominal risk  free interest rate  includes both compensation  for expected inflation and the real risk  free interest rate   Worldwide equity risk pre  miums reported at the bottom of Exhibit    show that equities outperformed bonds  and bonds outperformed T  bills   Investors in equities earned a higher return than  investors in T  bills because of the higher risk in stocks   Conversely investors in T  bills  cannot expect to earn as high a return as equity investors because the risk of their  holdings is much lower  A more dramatic representation of the risk return trade  off is shown in Exhibit    which shows the cumulative returns of US asset classes in real terms   The line rep  resenting T  bills is much less volatile than the other lines   Adjusted for inflation the  average real return on T  bills was      percent per year  The line representing bonds  is more volatile than the line for T  bills but less volatile than the line representing
1,263,   
2,263,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,263,stocks   The total return for equities including dividends and capital gains shows how     invested at the beginning of      grows to      generating an annualized return  of     percent in real terms   Over long periods of time we observe that higher risk does result in higher mean  returns   Thus  it is reasonable to claim that  over the long term market prices reward  higher risk with higher returns  which is a characteristic of a risk  averse investor a  topic that we discuss in Section   
4,263,    Other Investment Characteristics
5,263,In evaluating investments using mean  expected return  and variance  risk  we make  two important assumptions   First we assume that the returns are normally distributed  because a normal distribution can be fully characterized by its mean and variance   Second we assume that markets are not only informationally efficient but that they  are also operationally efficient   To the extent that these assumptions are violated we  need to consider additional investment characteristics   These are discussed below 
6,263,      Distributional Characteristics
7,263,As explained in an earlier reading  a normal distribution has three main characteris  tics   its mean and median are equal  it is completely defined by two parameters  mean  and variance  and it is symmetric around its mean with        percent of the observations within     of the mean       percent of the observations within     of the mean and       percent of the observations within     of the mean  Using only mean and variance would be appropriate to evaluate investments if returns  were distributed normally  Returns  however are not normally distributed  deviations  from normality occur both because the returns are skewed which means they are not  symmetric around the mean and because the probability of extreme events is signifi  cantly greater than what a normal distribution would suggest   The latter deviation is  referred to as kurtosis or fat tails in a return distribution  The next sections discuss  these deviations more in  depth  Skewness Skewness refers to asymmetry of the return distribution that is  returns  are not symmetric around the mean  A distribution is said to be left skewed or nega  tively skewed if most of the distribution is concentrated to the right and right skewed  or positively skewed if most is concentrated to the left  Exhibit    shows a typical  representation of negative and positive skewness  whereas Exhibit   demonstrates the  negative skewness of stock returns by plotting a histogram of US large company stock  returns for

36,264,Kurtosis Kurtosis refers to fat tails or higher than normal probabilities for extreme  returns and has the effect of increasing an asset s risk that is not captured in a mean  variance framework  as illustrated in Exhibit     Investors try to evaluate the effect of  kurtosis by using such statistical techniques as value at risk  VaR  and conditional tail  expectations   Several market participants note that the probability and the magnitude
37,264,  Value at risk is a money measure of the minimum losses expected on a portfolio during a specified time  period at a given level of probability  It is commonly used to measure the losses a portfolio can suffer under  normal market conditions   For example if a portfolio s one  day    percent VaR is         it implies that  there is a    percent probability that the value of the portfolio will decrease by more than         over  a single one  day period  under normal market conditions   This probability implies that the portfolio will  experience a loss of at least         on one out of every ten days

21,265,      Market Characteristics
22,265,In the previous analysis  we implicitly assumed that markets are both informationally  and operationally efficient   Although informational efficiency of markets is a topic  beyond the purview of this reading  we should highlight certain operational limitations  of the market that affect the choice of investments   One such limitation is liquidity  The cost of trading has three main components brokerage commission bid ask  spread and price impact of which liquidity affects the latter two  Brokerage commis  sion is usually negotiable and does not constitute a large fraction of the total cost of  trading except in small  sized trades   Stocks with low liquidity can have wide bid ask  spreads   The bid ask spread which is the difference between the buying price and  the selling price is incurred as a cost of trading a security  The larger the bid ask  spread the higher is the cost of trading   If a      stock has a spread of    cents  the  bid ask spread is only     percent               On the other hand if a     stock has  a spread of    cents  the bid ask spread is    percent   Clearly the     stock is more  expensive to trade and an investor will need to earn     percent extra to make up the  higher cost of trading relative to the      stock   Liquidity also has implications for the price impact of trade  Price impact refers  to how the price moves in response to an order in the market   Small orders usually  have little impact  especially for liquid stocks   For example an order to buy     shares  of a      stock with a spread of   cent may have no effect on the price  On the other  hand an order to buy        shares may have a significant impact on the price as the

4,266,buyer has to induce more and more stockholders to tender their shares   The extent of  the price impact depends on the liquidity of the stock   A stock that trades millions of  shares a day may be less affected than a stock that trades only a few hundred thou  sand shares a day  Investors  especially institutional investors managing large sums of  money must keep the liquidity of a stock in mind when making investment decisions   Liquidity is a bigger concern in emerging markets than in developed markets  because of the smaller volume of trading in those markets   Similarly liquidity is a  more important concern in corporate bond markets and especially for bonds of lower  credit quality than in equity markets because an individual corporate bond issue may  not trade for several days or weeks   This certainly became apparent during the global  financial crisis   There are other market  related characteristics that affect investment decisions  because they might instill greater confidence in the security or might affect the costs  of doing business   These include analyst coverage availability of information firm  size etc  These characteristics about companies and financial markets are essential  components of investment decision making  
5,266,RISK AVERSION AND PORTFOLIO SELECTION
6,266,As we have seen stocks  bonds  and T  bills provide different levels of returns and have  different levels of risk   Although investment in equities may be appropriate for one  investor another investor may not be inclined to accept the risk that accompanies a  share of stock and may prefer to hold more cash  In the last section we considered  investment characteristics of assets in understanding their risk and return  In this  section we consider the characteristics of investors  both individual and institutional  in an attempt to pair the right kind of investors with the right kind of investments   First we discuss risk aversion and utility theory  Later we discuss their implications  for portfolio selection 
7,266,    The Concept of Risk Aversion
8,266,The concept of risk aversion is related to the behavior of individuals under uncer  tainty  Assume that an individual is offered two alternatives   one where he will get      for sure and the other is a gamble with a    percent chance that he gets      and     percent chance that he gets nothing   The expected value in both cases is     one  with certainty and the other with uncertainty  What will an investor choose  There  are three possibilities   an investor chooses the gamble the investor chooses     with  certainty or the investor is indifferent   Let us consider each in turn  However please  understand that this is only a representative example and a single choice does not  determine the risk aversion of an investor 
9,266,Risk Seeking
10,266,If an investor chooses the gamble then the investor is said to be risk loving or risk  seeking   The gamble has an uncertain outcome but with the same expected value  as the guaranteed outcome  Thus  an investor choosing the gamble means that the  investor gets extra  utility   from the uncertainty associated with the gamble  How  much is that extra utility worth  Would the investor be willing to accept a smaller  expected value because he gets extra utility from risk  Indeed risk seekers will accept  less return because of the risk that accompanies the gamble  For example a risk seeker  may choose a gamble with an expected value of     in preference to a guaranteed  outcome of     
1,267,   
2,267,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,267,There is a little bit of gambling instinct in many of us   People buy lottery tickets  although the expected value is less than the money they pay to buy it   Or people  gamble at casinos in Macau or Las Vegas with the full knowledge that the expected  return is negative a characteristic of risk seekers   These or any other isolated actions   however cannot be taken at face value except for compulsive gamblers  
4,267,Risk Neutral
5,267,If an investor is indifferent about the gamble or the guaranteed outcome then the  investor may be risk neutral  Risk neutrality means that the investor cares only about  return and not about risk  so higher return investments are more desirable even if they  come with higher risk   Many investors may exhibit characteristics of risk neutrality  when the investment at stake is an insignificant part of their wealth  For example a  billionaire may be indifferent about choosing the gamble or a     guaranteed outcome 
6,267,Risk Averse
7,267,If an investor chooses the guaranteed outcome he she is said to be risk averse because  the investor does not want to take the chance of not getting anything at all  Depending  on the level of aversion to risk  an investor may be willing to accept a guaranteed  outcome of     instead of a gamble with an expected value of      In general investors are likely to shy away from risky investments for a lower but  guaranteed return  That is why they want to minimize their risk for the same amount  of return and maximize their return for the same amount of risk   The risk return  trade  off discussed earlier is an indicator of risk aversion  A risk  neutral investor would  maximize return irrespective of risk and a risk  seeking investor would maximize both  risk and return  Data presented in the last section illustrate the historically positive relationship  between risk and return which demonstrates that market prices were based on trans  actions and investments by risk  averse investors and reflect risk aversion  Therefore  for all practical purposes and for our future discussion we will assume that the repre  sentative investor is a risk  averse investor  This assumption is the standard approach  taken in the investment industry globally 
8,267,Risk Tolerance
9,267,Risk tolerance refers to the amount of risk an investor can tolerate to achieve an  investment goal  The higher the risk tolerance the greater is the willingness to take  risk   Thus  risk tolerance is negatively related to risk aversion 
10,267,    Utility Theory and Indifference Curves
11,267,Continuing with our previous example a risk  averse investor would rank the guar  anteed outcome of     higher than the uncertain outcome with an expected value  of      We can say that the utility that an investor or an individual derives from the  guaranteed outcome of     is greater than the utility or satisfaction or happiness he  she derives from the alternative  In general terms  utility is a measure of relative satis  faction from consumption of various goods and services or in the case of investments   the satisfaction that an investor derives from different portfolios   Because individuals are different in their preferences  all risk  averse individuals  may not rank investment alternatives in the same manner  Consider the     gamble  again  All risk  averse individuals will rank the guaranteed outcome of     higher than  the gamble  What if the guaranteed outcome is only      Some risk  averse investors  might consider     inadequate others might accept it  and still others may now be  indifferent about the uncertain     and the certain     
1,268,Risk Aversion and Portfolio Selection
2,268,   
3,268,A simple implementation of utility theory allows us to quantify the rankings of  investment choices using risk and return  There are several assumptions about indi  vidual behavior that we make in the definition of utility given in the equation below   We assume that investors are risk averse  They always prefer more to less  greater  return to lesser return   They are able to rank different portfolios in the order of their  preference and that the rankings are internally consistent   If an individual prefers X  to Y and Y to Z  then he she must prefer X to Z   This property implies that the indif  ference curves  see Exhibit     for the same individual can never touch or intersect    An example of a utility function is given below
4,268,          U E r  
5,268,  
6,268,A
7,268,where U is the utility of an investment  E r  is the expected return and    is the  variance of the investment   In the above equation A is a measure of risk aversion which is measured as the  marginal reward that an investor requires to accept additional risk   More risk  averse  investors require greater compensation for accepting additional risk   Thus  A is higher  for more risk  averse individuals   As was mentioned previously a risk  neutral investor  would maximize return irrespective of risk and a risk  seeking investor would maxi  mize both risk and return  We can draw several conclusions from the utility function  First utility is unbounded  on both sides   It can be highly positive or highly negative  Second higher return  contributes to higher utility  Third higher variance reduces the utility but the reduc  tion in utility gets amplified by the risk aversion coefficient  A  Utility can always be  increased albeit marginally by getting higher return or lower risk   Fourth utility does  not indicate or measure satisfaction  It can be useful only in ranking various invest  ments   For example a portfolio with a utility of   is not necessarily two times better  than a portfolio with a utility of    The portfolio with a utility of   could increase our  happiness    times or just marginally  But we do prefer a portfolio with a utility of    to a portfolio with a utility of    Utility cannot be compared among individuals or  investors because it is a very personal concept   From a societal point of view by the  same argument  utility cannot be summed among individuals   Let us explore the utility function further  The risk aversion coefficient A is greater  than zero for a risk  averse investor  So any increase in risk reduces his her utility  The  risk aversion coefficient for a risk  neutral investor is   and changes in risk do not  affect his her utility  For a risk lover the risk aversion coefficient is negative creating  an inverse situation so that additional risk contributes to an increase in his her utility   Note that a risk  free asset          generates the same utility for all individuals  
8,268,      Indifference Curves
9,268,An indifference curve plots the combinations of risk return pairs that an investor  would accept to maintain a given level of utility  i e  the investor is indifferent about  the combinations on any one curve because they would provide the same level of  overall utility   Indifference curves are thus defined in terms of a trade  off between  expected rate of return and variance of the rate of return  Because an infinite number  of combinations of risk and return can generate the same utility for the same investor  indifference curves are continuous at all points

32,269,A set of indifference curves is plotted in Exhibit     By definition all points on any  one of the three curves have the same utility  An investor does not care whether he  she is at Point a or Point b on indifference Curve    Point a has lower risk and lower  return than Point b but the utility of both points is the same because the higher return  at Point b is offset by the higher risk   Like Curve   all points on Curve   have the same utility and an investor is indif  ferent about where he she is on Curve    Now compare Point c with Point b  Point c  has the same risk but significantly lower return than Point b which means that the  utility at Point c is less than the utility at Point b  Given that all points on Curve   have  the same utility and all points on Curve   have the same utility and Point b has higher  utility than Point c Curve   has higher utility than Curve    Therefore risk  averse  investors with indifference Curves   and   will prefer Curve   to Curve    The utility  of risk  averse investors always increases as you move northwest higher return with  lower risk   Because all investors prefer more utility to less  investors want to move  northwest to the indifference curve with the highest utility  The indifference curve for risk  averse investors runs from the southwest to the  northeast because of the risk return trade  off  If risk increases  going east  then it  must be compensated by higher return  going north  to generate the same utility  The  indifference curves are convex because of diminishing marginal utility of return  or  wealth   As risk increases  an investor needs greater return to compensate for higher  risk at an increasing rate  i e  the curve gets steeper   The upward  sloping convex  indifference curve has a slope coefficient closely related to the risk aversion coeffi  cient   The greater the slope the higher is the risk aversion of the investor as a greater  increment in return is required to accept a given increase in risk   Indifference curves for investors with different levels of risk aversion are plotted in  Exhibit     The most risk  averse investor has an indifference curve with the greatest  slope  As volatility increases  this investor demands increasingly higher returns to  compensate for risk   The least risk  averse investor has an indifference curve with the  least slope and so the demand for higher return as risk increases is not as acute as for  the more risk  averse investor  The risk  loving investor  s indifference curve however  exhibits a negative slope implying that the risk  lover is happy to substitute risk for

3,272,    Application of Utility Theory to Portfolio Selection
4,272,The simplest application of utility theory and risk aversion is to a portfolio of two  assets  a risk  free asset and a risky asset   The risk  free asset has zero risk and a return  of Rf  The risky asset has a risk of  i       and an expected return of E Ri   Because  the risky asset has risk that is greater than that of the risk  free asset  the expected  return from the risky asset will be greater than the return from the risk  free asset   that is  E Ri    Rf  We can construct a portfolio of these two assets with a portfolio expected return  E Rp  and portfolio risk   p based on sections       and        In the equations given  below w  is the weight in the risk  free asset and      w   is the weight in the risky  asset   Because  f     for the risk  free asset  the first and third terms in the formula  for variance are zero leaving only the second term  We arrive at the last equation by  taking the square root of both sides  which shows the expression for standard deviation  for a portfolio of two assets when one asset is the risk  free asset

40,274,The capital allocation line consists of the set of feasible portfolios   Points under  the capital allocation line may be attainable but are not preferred by any investor  because the investor can get a higher return for the same risk by moving up to the  capital allocation line  Points above the capital allocation line are desirable but not  achievable with available assets   Three indifference curves for the same individual are also shown in Exhibit       Curve   is above the capital allocation line Curve   is tangential to the line and  Curve   intersects the line at two points   Curve   has the highest utility and Curve    has the lowest utility  Because Curve   lies completely above the capital allocation  line points on Curve   are not achievable with the available assets on the capital  allocation line  Curve   intersects the capital allocation line at two Points  a and b   The investor is able to invest at either Point a or b to derive the risk return trade  off  and utility associated with Curve    Comparing points with the same risk  observe  that Point n on Curve   has the same risk as Point m on Curve   yet Point m has the  higher expected return  Therefore all investors will choose Curve   instead of Curve     Curve   is tangential to the capital allocation line at Point m  Point m is on the  capital allocation line and investable  Point m and the utility associated with Curve    is the best that the investor can do because he she cannot move to a higher utility  indifference curve  Thus  we have been able to select the optimal portfolio for the  investor with indifference Curves     and    Point m the optimal portfolio for one  investor may not be optimal for another investor  We can follow the same process   however for finding the optimal portfolio for other investors   the optimal portfolio is  the point of tangency between the capital allocation line and the indifference curve for  that investor  In other words  the optimal portfolio maximizes the return per unit of  risk  as it is on the capital allocation line  and it simultaneously supplies the investor  with the most satisfaction  utility   As an illustration Exhibit    shows two indifference curves for two different inves  tors   Kelly with a risk aversion coefficient of   and Jane with a risk aversion coefficient  of    The indifference curve for Kelly is to the right of the indifference curve for Jane  because Kelly is less risk averse than Jane and can accept a higher amount of risk   i e  has a higher tolerance for risk   Accordingly their optimal portfolios are different    Point k is the optimal portfolio for Kelly and Point j is the optimal portfolio for Jane

37,275,PORTFOLIO RISK
38,275,We have seen before that investors are risk averse and demand a higher return for a  riskier investment  Therefore ways of controlling portfolio risk without affecting return  are valuable  As a precursor to managing risk  this section explains and analyzes the  components of portfolio risk   In particular it examines and describes how a portfolio  consisting of assets with low correlations have the potential of reducing risk without  necessarily reducing return 
39,275,    Portfolio of Two Risky Assets
40,275,The return and risk of a portfolio of two assets was introduced in Section   of this  reading   In this section we briefly review the computation of return and extend the  concept of portfolio risk and its components  
41,275,      Portfolio Return
42,275,When two individual assets are combined in a portfolio we can compute the port  folio return as a weighted average of the returns of the two assets   Consider Assets    and   with weights of    percent and    percent in a portfolio  If their returns are     percent and   percent  the weighted average return                                        More generally the portfolio return can be written as below where Rp is  return of the portfolio and R  R  are returns on the two assets

72,276,      Covariance and Correlation
73,276,The covariance in the formula for portfolio standard deviation can be expanded as  Cov R R             where     is the correlation between returns  R  R   Although  covariance is important  it is difficult to interpret because it is unbounded on both  sides   It is easier to understand the correlation coefficient       which is bounded  but provides similar information  Correlation is a measure of the consistency or tendency for two investments to  act in a similar way  The correlation coefficient      can be positive or negative and  ranges from    to     Consider three different values of the correlation coefficient                Returns of the two assets are perfectly positively correlated  Assets    and   move together     percent of the time               Returns of the two assets are perfectly negatively correlated  Assets    and   move in opposite directions     percent of the time              Returns of the two assets are uncorrelated  Movement of Asset   pro  vides no prediction regarding the movement of Asset    The correlation coefficient between two assets determines the effect on portfolio  risk when the two assets are combined  To see how this works  consider two different  values of      You will find that portfolio risk is unaffected when the two assets are  perfectly correlated             In other words  the portfolio s standard deviation is  simply a weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets and as such a  portfolio s risk is unchanged with the addition of assets with the same risk parameters    Portfolio risk falls  however when the two assets are not perfectly correlated              Sufficiently low values of the correlation coefficient can make the portfolio riskless  under certain conditions

123,276,The first set of terms on the right side of the first equation contain the usual terms  for portfolio variance  Because the correlation coefficient is equal to    the right  side can be rewritten as a perfect square  The third row shows that portfolio risk is a  weighted average of the risks of the individual assets  risks   In Subsection        the
1,277,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
2,277,   
3,277,portfolio return was shown always to be a weighted average of returns   Because both  risk and return are just weighted averages of the two assets in the portfolio there is  no reduction in risk when          
4,277,Now let         
5,277,The above analysis showed that portfolio risk is a weighted average of asset risks when             When          the portfolio risk is less than the weighted average of the  individual assets  risks   To show this  we begin by reproducing the general formula for portfolio risk  which  is expressed by the terms to the left of the     sign below  The term to the right of      shows the portfolio risk when

50,277,The left side is smaller than the right side because the correlation coefficient on the  left side for the new portfolio is     Thus  the portfolio risk is less than the weighted  average of risks while the portfolio return is still a weighted average of returns   As you can see we have achieved diversification by combining two assets that are  not perfectly correlated  For an extreme case in which           that is  the two asset  returns move in opposite directions  the portfolio can be made risk free

121,278,The previous example illustrated the effect of correlation on portfolio risk while keeping  the weights in the two assets equal and unchanged  In this section we consider how  portfolio risk and return vary with different portfolio weights and different correla  tions   Formulas for computation are in Subsections       and        Asset   has an annual return of   percent and annualized risk of    percent whereas  Asset   has an annual return of     percent and annualized risk of     percent   The  relationship is tabulated in Exhibit    for the two assets and graphically represented  in Exhibit

67,280,    Portfolio of Many Risky Assets
68,280,In the previous section we discussed how the correlation between two assets can  affect the risk of a portfolio and the smaller the correlation the lower is the risk   The  above analysis can be extended to a portfolio with many risky assets  N   Recall the  following equations from Sections       and       for portfolio return and variance

118,280,To examine how a portfolio with many risky assets works and the ways in which  we can reduce the risk of a portfolio assume that the portfolio has equal weights    N   for all N assets   In addition assume that    and Cov are the average variance and

43,281,The equation in the second line shows that as N becomes large the first term on  the right side with the denominator of N becomes smaller and smaller implying that  the contribution of one asset s variance to portfolio variance gradually becomes neg  ligible  The second term however approaches the average covariance as N increases    It is reasonable to say that for portfolios with a large number of assets  covariance  among the assets accounts for almost all of the portfolio s risk  
44,281,      Importance of Correlation in a Portfolio of Many Assets
45,281,The analysis becomes more instructive and interesting if we assume that all assets in  the portfolio have the same variance and the same correlation among assets   In that  case the portfolio risk can then be rewritten as

60,281,The first term under the root sign becomes negligible as the number of assets in  the portfolio increases leaving the second term  correlation  as the main determining  factor for portfolio risk   If the assets are unrelated to one another the portfolio can  have close to zero risk   In the next section we review these concepts to learn how  portfolios can be diversified 
61,281,    The Power of Diversification
62,281,Diversification is one of the most important and powerful concepts in investments    Because investors are risk averse they are interested in reducing risk preferably without  reducing return  In other cases  investors may accept a lower return if it will reduce  the chance of catastrophic losses   In previous sections of this reading  you learned  the importance of correlation and covariance in managing risk   This section applies  those concepts to explore ways for risk diversification  We begin with a simple but  intuitive example 
63,281,Diversification with Rain and Shine
64,281,Assume a company Beachwear rents beach equipment   The annual return from  the company  s operations is    percent in years with many sunny days but falls  to   percent in rainy years with few sunny days   The probabilities of a sunny year  and a rainy year are equal at    percent   Thus  the average return is    percent   with a    percent chance of    percent return and a    percent chance of   per  cent return  Because Beachwear can earn a return of     percent or    percent   its average return of    percent is risky 
65,281,EXAMPLE

2,282,   
3,282,You are excited about investing in Beachwear but do not like the risk   Having  heard about diversification you decide to add another business to the portfolio  to reduce your investment risk      There is a snack shop on the beach that sells all the healthy food you like   You estimate that the annual return from the Snackshop is also    percent  in years with many sunny days and   percent in other years   As with the  Beachwear shop the average return is    percent   You decide to invest     percent each in Snackshop and Beachwear  The  average return is still    percent  with    percent of    percent from Snackshop  and    percent of    percent from Beachwear  In a sunny year you would earn     percent        of     from Beachwear       of     from Snackshop   In  a rainy year you would earn   percent       of    from Beachwear       of     from Snackshop   The results are tabulated in Exhibit

23,282,These results seem counterintuitive  You thought that by adding another  business you would be able to diversify and reduce your risk  but the risk is  exactly the same as before  What went wrong  Note that both businesses do  well when it is sunny and both businesses do poorly when it rains   The correla  tion between the two businesses is       No reduction in risk occurs when the  correlation is          To reduce risk  you must consider a business that does well in a rainy year   You find a company that rents DVDs   DVDrental company is similar to  the Beachwear company except that its annual return is    percent in a  rainy year and   percent in a sunny year with an average return of    per  cent   DVDrental s    percent return is also risky just like Beachwear  s  return   If you invest     percent each in DVDrental and Beachwear then the aver  age return is still     percent  with     percent of     percent from DVDrental  and    percent of    percent from Beachwear  In a sunny year you would earn      percent        of     from Beachwear       of    from DVDrental   In  a rainy year also you would earn     percent       of    from Beachwear        of     from DVDrental   You have no risk because you earn     percent  in both sunny and rainy years   Thus  by adding DVDrental to Beachwear you  have reduced  eliminated  your risk without affecting your return  The results  are tabulated in Exhibit

23,283,      Correlation and Risk Diversification
24,283,Correlation is the key in diversification of risk   Notice that the returns from Beachwear  and DVDRental always go in the opposite direction  If one of them does well the  other does not   Therefore adding assets that do not behave like other assets in your  portfolio is good and can reduce risk   The two companies in the above example have  a correlation of       Even when we expand the portfolio to many assets  correlation among assets  remains the primary determinant of portfolio risk   Lower correlations are associated  with lower risk   Unfortunately most assets have high positive correlations   The chal  lenge in diversifying risk is to find assets that have a correlation that is much lower  than      
25,283,      Historical Risk and Correlation
26,283,When we discussed asset returns in section       we were careful to distinguish  between historical or past returns and expected or future returns because historical  returns may not be a good indicator of future returns   Returns may be highly positive  in one period and highly negative in another period depending on the risk of that  asset   Exhibit    showed that returns for large US company stocks were high in the      s but have been very low in the     s   Risk for an asset class  however does not usually change dramatically from one  period to the next   Stocks have been risky even in periods of low returns   T  bills are  always less risky even when they earn high returns   From Exhibit   we can see that  risk has typically not varied much from one decade to the next  except that risk for  bonds has been much higher in recent decades when compared with earlier decades    Therefore it is not unreasonable to assume that historical risk can work as a good  proxy for future risk   As with risk  correlations are quite stable among assets of the same country   Intercountry correlations  however have been on the rise in the last few decades  as a result of globalization and the liberalization of many economies   A correlation  above      is considered high because the assets do not provide much opportunity  for diversification of risk  such as the correlations that exist among large US company  stocks on the NYSE  NASDAQ S P     Index  and Dow Jones Industrial Average   Correlations below      are considered attractive for portfolio diversification

36,284,The low correlations between stocks and bonds are attractive for portfolio diver  sification  Similarly including international securities in a portfolio can also control  portfolio risk   It is not surprising that most diversified portfolios of investors contain  domestic stocks  domestic bonds  foreign stocks  foreign bonds  real estate cash and  other asset classes  
37,284,      Avenues for Diversification
38,284,The reason for diversification is simple  By constructing a portfolio with assets that  do not move together you create a portfolio that reduces the ups and downs in the  short term but continues to grow steadily in the long term  Diversification thus makes  a portfolio more resilient to gyrations in financial markets  
39,284,  In any short period T  bills are riskless and uncorrelated with other asset classes   For example a    month  US Treasury bill is redeemable at its face value upon maturity irrespective of what happens to other assets    When we consider multiple periods  however returns on T  bills may be related to other asset classes  because short  term interest rates vary depending on the strength of the economy and outlook for inflation

3,285,We describe a number of approaches for diversification some of which have been  discussed previously and some of which might seem too obvious   Diversification  however is such an important part of investing that it cannot be emphasized enough  especially when we continue to meet and see many investors who are not properly  diversified     Diversify with asset classes  Correlations among major asset classes  are  not usually high as can be observed from the few US asset classes listed in  Exhibit     Correlations for other asset classes and other countries are also typ  ically low which provides investors the opportunity to benefit from diversifying  among many asset classes to achieve the biggest benefit from diversification  A  partial list of asset classes includes domestic large caps  domestic small caps   growth stocks  value stocks  domestic corporate bonds  long  term domestic  government bonds  domestic Treasury bills  cash  emerging market stocks   emerging market bonds  developed market stocks  i e  developed markets  excluding domestic market  developed market bonds  real estate and gold and  other commodities   In addition industries and sectors are used to diversify  portfolios   For example energy stocks may not be well correlated with health  care stocks   The exact proportions in which these assets should be included in a  portfolio depend on the risk  return and correlation characteristics of each and  the home country of the investor     Diversify with index funds  Diversifying among asset classes can become costly  for small portfolios because of the number of securities required  For example  creating exposure to a single category such as a domestic large company asset  class  may require a group of at least    stocks   Exposure to    asset classes  may require     securities  which can be expensive to trade and track   Instead  it may be effective to use exchange  traded funds or mutual funds that track the  respective indexes  which could bring down the costs associated with building  a well  diversified portfolio  Therefore many investors should seriously consider  index mutual funds as an investment vehicle as opposed to individual securities      Diversification among countries  Countries are different because of different  economic fundamentals  industry focus  economic policy and political cli  mate  Thus  securities of issuers domiciled in different countries provide an  opportunity for diversification  Country returns may also be different because  of different currencies   In other words  the return on a foreign investment may  be different when translated to the home country  s currency  Because currency  returns are uncorrelated with stock returns  they may help reduce the risk of  investing in a foreign country even when that country in isolation is a very  risky emerging market from an equity investment point of view  Investment in  foreign countries is an essential part of a well  diversified portfolio     Diversify by not owning your employer  s stock   Companies encourage their  employees to invest in company stock through employee stock plans and  retirement plans   You should evaluate investing in your company however just  as you would evaluate any other investment   In addition you should consider  the nonfinancial investments that you have made especially the human capi  tal you have invested in your company  Because you work for your employer  you are already heavily invested in it because your earnings depend on your  employer  The level of your earnings  whether your compensation improves or  whether you get a promotion depends on how well your employer performs   If

3,286,a competitor drives your employer out of the market  you will be out of a job   Additional investments in your employer will concentrate your wealth in one  asset even more so and make you less diversified     Evaluate each asset before adding to a portfolio  Every time you add a security  or an asset class to the portfolio recognize that there is a cost associated with  diversification  There is a cost of trading an asset as well as the cost of tracking a  larger portfolio  In some cases  the securities or assets may have different names  but belong to an asset class in which you already have sufficient exposure  A  general rule to evaluate whether a new asset should be included to an existing  portfolio is based on the following risk return trade  off relationship

4,287,EFFICIENT FRONTIER AND INVESTOR S OPTIMAL  PORTFOLIO
5,287,In this section we formalize the effect of diversification and expand the set of invest  ments to include all available risky assets in a mean variance framework   The addition  of a risk  free asset generates an optimal risky portfolio and the capital allocation line   We can then derive an investor  s optimal portfolio by overlaying the capital allocation  line with the indifference curves of investors  
6,287,    Investment Opportunity Set
7,287,If two assets are perfectly correlated the risk return opportunity set is represented  by a straight line connecting those two assets   The line contains portfolios formed  by changing the weight of each asset invested in the portfolio  This correlation was  depicted by the straight line  with        in Exhibit     If the two assets are not per  fectly correlated the portfolio s risk is less than the weighted average risk of the com  ponents  and the portfolio formed from the two assets bulges on the left as shown by  curves with the correlation coefficient     less than     in Exhibit     All of the points  connecting the two assets are achievable  or feasible   The addition of new assets to  this portfolio creates more and more portfolios that are either a linear combination  of the existing portfolio and the new asset or a curvilinear combination depending  on the correlation between the existing portfolio and the new asset   As the number of available assets increases  the number of possible combinations  increases rapidly  When all investable assets are considered and there are hundreds  and thousands of them we can construct an opportunity set of investments   The  opportunity set will ordinarily span all points within a frontier because it is also pos  sible to reach every possible point within that curve by judiciously creating a portfolio  from the investable assets   We begin with individual investable assets and gradually form portfolios that can  be plotted to form a curve as shown in Exhibit     All points on the curve and points  to the right of the curve are attainable by a combination of one or more of the invest  able assets   This set of points is called the investment opportunity set   Initially the  opportunity set consists of domestic assets only and is labeled as such in Exhibit

26,288,      Addition of Asset Classes
27,288,Exhibit    shows the effect of adding a new asset class  such as international assets    As long as the new asset class is not perfectly correlated with the existing asset class   the investment opportunity set will expand out further to the northwest  providing a  superior risk return trade  off  The investment opportunity set with international assets dominates the opportunity  set that includes only domestic assets   Adding other asset classes will have the same  impact on the opportunity set   Thus  we should continue to add asset classes until  they do not further improve the risk return trade  off  The benefits of diversification  can be fully captured in this way in the construction of the investment opportunity  set  and eventually in the selection of the optimal portfolio  In the discussion that follows in this section we will assume that all investable  assets available to an investor are included in the investment opportunity set and no  special attention needs to be paid to new asset classes or new investment opportunities  
28,288,    Minimum  Variance Portfolios
29,288,The investment opportunity set consisting of all available investable sets is shown in  Exhibit      There are a large number of portfolios available for investment  but we  must choose a single optimal portfolio  In this subsection we begin the selection  process by narrowing the choice to fewer portfolios

32,289,      Minimum  Variance Frontier
33,289,Risk  averse investors seek to minimize risk for a given return  Consider Points A  B and  X in Exhibit    and assume that they are on the same horizontal line by construction   Thus  the three points have the same expected return E R   as do all other points on  the imaginary line connecting A  B and X  Given a choice an investor will choose  the point with the minimum risk  which is Point X  Point X however is unattainable  because it does not lie within the investment opportunity set  Thus  the minimum risk  that we can attain for E R   is at Point A   Point B and all points to the right of Point  A are feasible but they have higher risk   Therefore a risk  averse investor will choose  only Point A in preference to any other portfolio with the same return  Similarly Point C is the minimum variance point for the return earned at C   Points  to the right of C have higher risk   We can extend the above analysis to all possible  returns   In all cases  we find that the minimum  variance portfolio is the one that  lies on the solid curve drawn in Exhibit     The entire collection of these minimum   variance portfolios is referred to as the minimum  variance frontier  The minimum   variance frontier defines the smaller set of portfolios in which investors would want  to invest   Note that no risk  averse investor will choose to invest in a portfolio to the  right of the minimum  variance frontier because a portfolio on the minimum  variance  frontier can give the same return but at a lower risk  
34,289,      Global Minimum  Variance Portfolio
35,289,The left  most point on the minimum  variance frontier is the portfolio with the min  imum variance among all portfolios of risky assets  and is referred to as the global  minimum  variance portfolio  An investor cannot hold a portfolio consisting of risky  assets that has less risk than that of the global minimum  variance portfolio  Note the  emphasis on  risky   assets   Later the introduction of a risk  free asset will allow us  to relax this constraint  
1,290,Efficient Frontier and Investor  s Optimal Portfolio
2,290,   
3,290,      Efficient Frontier of Risky Assets
4,290,The minimum  variance frontier gives us portfolios with the minimum variance for a  given return  However investors also want to maximize return for a given risk   Observe  Points A and C on the minimum  variance frontier shown in Exhibit     Both of them  have the same risk   Given a choice an investor will choose Portfolio A because it  has a higher return  No one will choose Portfolio C   The same analysis applies to all  points on the minimum  variance frontier that lie below the global minimum  variance  portfolio  Thus  portfolios on the curve below the global minimum  variance portfolio  and to the right of the global minimum  variance portfolio are not beneficial and are  inefficient portfolios for an investor  The curve that lies above and to the right of the global minimum  variance portfolio  is referred to as the Markowitz efficient frontier because it contains all portfolios of  risky assets that rational risk  averse investors will choose  An important observation that is often ignored is the slope at various points on  the efficient frontier  As we move right from the global minimum  variance portfolio   Point Z  in Exhibit    there is an increase in risk with a concurrent increase in return   The increase in return with every unit increase in risk  however keeps decreasing as  we move from left to the right because the slope continues to decrease  The slope at  Point D is less than the slope at Point A  which is less than the slope at Point Z   The  increase in return by moving from Point Z to Point A is the same as the increase in  return by moving from Point A to Point D  It can be seen that the additional risk in  moving from Point A to Point D is   to   times more than the additional risk in mov  ing from Point Z to Point A   Thus  investors obtain decreasing increases in returns  as they assume more risk  
5,290,    A Risk  Free Asset and Many Risky Assets
6,290,Until now we have only considered risky assets in which the return is risky or uncertain   Most investors  however have access to a risk  free asset  most notably from securities  issued by the government   The addition of a risk  free asset makes the investment  opportunity set much richer than the investment opportunity set consisting only of  risky assets  
7,290,      Capital Allocation Line and Optimal Risky Portfolio
8,290,By definition a risk  free asset has zero risk so it must lie on the y axis in a mean   variance graph  A risk  free asset with a return of Rf is plotted in Exhibit     This asset  can now be combined with a portfolio of risky assets   The combination of a risk  free  asset with a portfolio of risky assets is a straight line such as in Section      see  Exhibit      Unlike in Section     however we have many risky portfolios to choose  from instead of a single risky portfolio

19,291,All portfolios on the efficient frontier are candidates for being combined with the  risk  free asset   Two combinations are shown in Exhibit     one between the risk  free  asset and efficient Portfolio A and the other between the risk  free asset and efficient  Portfolio P  Comparing capital allocation line A and capital allocation line P reveals  that there is a point on CAL P  with a higher return and same risk for each point  on CAL A   In other words  the portfolios on CAL P  dominate the portfolios on  CAL A   Therefore an investor will choose CAL P  over CAL A   We would like to  move further northwest to achieve even better portfolios   None of those portfolios   however is attainable because they are above the efficient frontier  What about other points on the efficient frontier  For example Point X is on  the efficient frontier and has the highest return of all risky portfolios for its risk    However Point Y on CAL P  achievable by leveraging Portfolio P as seen in Section      lies above Point X and has the same risk but higher return  In the same way we  can observe that not only does CAL P  dominate CAL A  but it also dominates the  Markowitz efficient frontier of risky assets   CAL P  is the optimal capital allocation line and Portfolio P is the optimal risky  portfolio  Thus  with the addition of the risk  free asset  we are able to narrow our  selection of risky portfolios to a single optimal risky portfolio P which is at the tan  gent of CAL P  and the efficient frontier of risky assets  
20,291,      The Two  Fund Separation Theorem
21,291,The two  fund separation theorem states that all investors regardless of taste risk  preferences  and initial wealth will hold a combination of two portfolios or funds   a  risk  free asset and an optimal portfolio of risky assets    The separation theorem allows us to divide an investor  s investment problem into  two distinct steps   the investment decision and the financing decision  In the first  step as in the previous analysis  the investor identifies the optimal risky portfolio  The  optimal risky portfolio is selected from numerous risky portfolios without considering  the investor  s preferences   The investment decision at this step is based on the optimal  risky portfolio s  a single portfolio  return risk  and correlations  
22,291,  In the next reading  you will learn that the optimal portfolio of risky assets is the market portfolio 
1,292,Efficient Frontier and Investor  s Optimal Portfolio
2,292,   
3,292,The capital allocation line connects the optimal risky portfolio and the risk  free  asset   All optimal investor portfolios must be on this line  Each investor  s optimal  portfolio on the CAL P  is determined in the second step  Considering each individual  investor  s risk preference using indifference curves  determines the investor  s allocation  to the risk  free asset  lending  and to the optimal risky portfolio  Portfolios beyond the  optimal risky portfolio are obtained by borrowing at the risk  free rate  i e  buying on  margin   Therefore the individual investor  s risk preference determines the amount  of financing  i e  lending to the government instead of investing in the optimal risky  portfolio or borrowing to purchase additional amounts of the optimal risky portfolio

4,293,Solution to   
5,293,Portfolio A is not attainable because it lies outside the feasible set and not on  the capital allocation line 
6,293,Solution to   
7,293,Portfolios G and C will not be chosen because D provides higher return for the  same risk   G and C are the only investable points that do not lie on the capital  allocation line 
8,293,Solution to   
9,293,Portfolio D is most suitable because a risk  neutral investor cares only about  return and portfolio D provides the highest return  A     in the utility formula  
10,293,Solution to   
11,293,Gold may be owned as part of a portfolio  not as the portfolio  because gold  has low or negative correlation with many risky assets  such as stocks   Being  part of a portfolio can thus reduce overall risk even though its standalone risk  is high and return is low  Note that gold s price is not stable its return is very  risky     percent   Even risk seekers will choose D over G which has the same  risk but higher return

77,298,The location of an optimal investor portfolio depends on the investor  s risk prefer  ences   A highly risk  averse investor may invest a large proportion even     percent   of his her assets in the risk  free asset   The optimal portfolio in this investor  s case  will be located close to the y axis   A less risk  averse investor however may invest a  large portion of his her wealth in the optimal risky asset   The optimal portfolio in  this investor  s case will lie closer to Point P in Exhibit     Some less risk  averse investors  i e  with a high risk tolerance  may wish to accept  even more risk because of the chance of higher return  Such an investor may borrow  money to invest more in the risky portfolio  If the investor borrows     percent of  his wealth he she can invest     percent in the optimal risky portfolio  The optimal  investor portfolio for such an investor will lie to the right of Point P on the capital  allocation line 
1,299,   
2,299,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part I
3,299,Thus  moving from the risk  free asset along the capital allocation line we encounter  investors who are willing to accept more risk   At Point P the investor is     percent  invested in the optimal risky portfolio  Beyond Point P the investor accepts even more  risk by borrowing money and investing in the optimal risky portfolio  Note that we are able to accommodate all types of investors with just two portfolios   the risk  free asset and the optimal risky portfolio  Exhibit     is also an illustration  of the two  fund separation theorem  Portfolio P is the optimal risky portfolio that  is selected without regard to investor preferences   The optimal investor portfolio  is selected on the capital allocation line by overlaying the indifference curves that  incorporate investor preferences  
4,299,SUMMARY
5,299,This reading provides a description and computation of investment characteristics   such as risk and return that investors use in evaluating assets for investment   This  was followed by sections about portfolio construction selection of an optimal risky  portfolio and an understanding of risk aversion and indifference curves   Finally  the tangency point of the indifference curves with the capital allocation line allows  identification of the optimal investor portfolio  Key concepts covered in the reading  include the following     Holding period return is most appropriate for a single predefined holding  period     Multiperiod returns can be aggregated in many ways   Each return computation  has special applications for evaluating investments      Risk  averse investors make investment decisions based on the risk return  trade  off maximizing return for the same risk  and minimizing risk for the  same return  They may be concerned however by deviations from a normal  return distribution and from assumptions of financial markets  operational  efficiency     Investors are risk averse and historical data confirm that financial markets price  assets for risk  averse investors      The risk of a two  asset portfolio is dependent on the proportions of each asset   their standard deviations and the correlation  or covariance  between the asset s  returns   As the number of assets in a portfolio increases  the correlation among  asset risks becomes a more important determinate of portfolio risk      Combining assets with low correlations reduces portfolio risk      The two  fund separation theorem allows us to separate decision making into  two steps   In the first step the optimal risky portfolio and the capital alloca  tion line are identified which are the same for all investors   In the second step  investor risk preferences enable us to find a unique optimal investor portfolio  for each investor     The addition of a risk  free asset creates portfolios that are dominant to portfo  lios of risky assets in all cases except for the optimal risky portfolio  By successfully understanding the content of this reading  you should be comfortable  calculating an investor  s optimal portfolio given the investor  s risk preferences and  universe of investable assets available

9,312,INTRODUCTION
10,312,Our objective in this reading is to identify the optimal risky portfolio for all investors  by using the capital asset pricing model  CAPM   The foundation of this reading is  the computation of risk and return of a portfolio and the role that correlation plays  in diversifying portfolio risk and arriving at the efficient frontier  The efficient frontier  and the capital allocation line consist of portfolios that are generally acceptable to all

3,313,investors   By combining an investor  s individual indifference curves with the market   determined capital allocation line we are able to illustrate that the only optimal risky  portfolio for an investor is the portfolio of all risky assets  i e  the market   Additionally we discuss the capital market line a special case of the capital allo  cation line that is used for passive investor portfolios   We also differentiate between  systematic and nonsystematic risk  and explain why investors are compensated for  bearing systematic risk but receive no compensation for bearing nonsystematic risk    We discuss in detail the CAPM which is a simple model for estimating asset returns  based only on the asset s systematic risk   Finally we illustrate how the CAPM allows  security selection to build an optimal portfolio for an investor by changing the asset  mix beyond a passive market portfolio  The reading is organized as follows   In Section   we discuss the consequences of  combining a risk  free asset with the market portfolio and provide an interpretation  of the capital market line  Section   decomposes total risk into systematic and non  systematic risk and discusses the characteristics of and differences between the two  kinds of risk   We also introduce return  generating models  including the single  index  model and illustrate the calculation of beta by using formulas and graphically by using  the security characteristic line  In Section   we introduce the capital asset pricing  model and the security market line  We discuss many applications of the CAPM and  the SML throughout the reading  including the use of expected return in making cap  ital budgeting decisions  the evaluation of portfolios using the CAPM s risk  adjusted  return as the benchmark  security selection and determining whether adding a new  security to the current portfolio is appropriate  Our focus on the CAPM does not  suggest that the CAPM is the only viable asset pricing model  Although the CAPM  is an excellent starting point  more advanced readings expand on these discussions  and extend the analysis to other models that account for multiple explanatory factors    A preview of a number of these models is given in Section   and a summary and  practice problems conclude the reading  
4,313,CAPITAL MARKET THEORY
5,313,You have learned how to combine a risk  free asset with one risky asset and with many  risky assets to create a capital allocation line  In this section we will expand our dis  cussion of multiple risky assets and consider a special case of the capital allocation  line called the capital market line  While discussing the capital market line we will  define the market and its role in passive portfolio management   Using these concepts   we will illustrate how leveraged portfolios can enhance both risk and return 
6,313,    Portfolio of Risk  Free and Risky Assets
7,313,Although investors desire an asset that produces the highest return and carries the  lowest risk  such an asset does not exist   As the risk return capital market theory  illustrates  one must assume higher risk in order to earn a higher return  We can  improve an investor  s portfolio however by expanding the opportunity set of risky  assets because this allows the investor to choose a superior mix of assets   Similarly an investor  s portfolio improves if a risk  free asset is added to the mix    In other words  a combination of the risk  free asset and a risky asset can result in a  better risk return trade  off than an investment in only one type of asset because the  risk  free asset has zero correlation with the risky asset   The combination is called the  capital allocation line  and is depicted in Exhibit     Superimposing an investor  s indif  ference curves on the capital allocation line will lead to the optimal investor portfolio

3,314,Investors with different levels of risk aversion will choose different portfolios    Highly risk  averse investors choose to invest most of their wealth in the risk  free asset  and earn low returns because they are not willing to assume higher levels of risk   Less  risk  averse investors  in contrast  invest more of their wealth in the risky asset  which  is expected to yield a higher return  Obviously the higher return cannot come without  higher risk  but the less risk  averse investor is willing to accept the additional risk  
4,314,      Combining a Risk  Free Asset with a Portfolio of Risky Assets
5,314,We can extend the analysis of one risky asset to a portfolio of risky assets   For con  venience assume that the portfolio contains all available risky assets   although an  investor may not wish to include all of these assets in the portfolio because of the  investor  s specific preferences   If an asset is not included in the portfolio its weight  will be zero  The risk return characteristics of a portfolio of N risky assets are given  by the following equations

51,314,The expected return on the portfolio E Rp  is the weighted average of the expected  returns of individual assets  where wi is the fractional weight in asset i and Ri is the  expected return of asset i  The risk of the portfolio   p  however depends on the  weights of the individual assets  the risk of the individual assets  and their interrela  tionships   The covariance between assets i and j Cov ij  is a statistical measure of the  interrelationship between each pair of assets in the portfolio and can be expressed as  follows  where  ij is the correlation between assets i and j and  i is the risk of asset i  Cov ij     ij i j Note from the equation below that the correlation of an asset with itself is    therefore  Cov ii     ii i i    i By substituting the above expressions for covariance we can rewrite the portfolio  variance equation as

80,314,The suggestion that portfolios have lower risk than the assets they contain may  seem counterintuitive  These portfolios can be constructed however as long as the  assets in the portfolio are not perfectly correlated  As an illustration of the effect  of asset weights on portfolio characteristics  consider a simple two  asset portfolio  with zero weights in all other assets   Assume that Asset   has a return of    percent  and a standard deviation  risk  of     percent   Asset   has a return of    percent and  a standard deviation  risk  of     percent   Furthermore the correlation between the  two assets is zero  Exhibit   shows risks and returns for Portfolio X with a weight of     percent in Asset   and    percent in Asset   Portfolio Y with a weight of    per  cent in each of the two assets  and Portfolio Z with a weight of    percent in Asset    and    percent in Asset

19,315,From this example we observe that the three portfolios are quite different in terms  of their risk and return  Portfolio X has a      percent return and only      percent  standard deviation whereas the standard deviation of Portfolio Z is more than two   thirds higher        percent  although the return is only slightly more than one  third  higher        percent   These portfolios may become even more dissimilar as other  assets are added to the mix   Consider three portfolios of risky assets  A  B and C  as in Exhibit   that may have  been presented to a representative investor by three different investment advisers    Each portfolio is combined with the risk  free asset to create three capital allocation  lines  CAL A  CAL B  and CAL C   The exhibit shows that Portfolio C is superior to  the other two portfolios because it has a greater expected return for any given level of  risk   As a result  an investor will choose the portfolio that lies on the capital allocation  line for Portfolio C   The combination of the risk  free asset and the risky Portfolio C  that is selected for an investor depends on the investor  s degree of risk aversion

3,316,      Does a Unique Optimal Risky Portfolio Exist 
4,316,We assume that all investors have the same economic expectation and thus have the  same expectations of prices  cash flows  and other investment characteristics   This  assumption is referred to as homogeneity of expectations  Given these investment  characteristics  everyone goes through the same calculations and should arrive at  the same optimal risky portfolio  Therefore assuming homogeneous expectations   only one optimal portfolio exists   If investors have different expectations  however  they might arrive at different optimal risky portfolios   To illustrate we begin with an  expression for the price of an asset

16,316,where CFt is the cash flow at the end of period t and rt is the discount rate or the  required rate of return for that asset for period t  Period t refers to all periods begin  ning from now until the asset ceases to exist at the end of time T  Because the current  time is the end of period   which is the same as the beginning of period   there are   T      cash flows and  T      required rates of return  These conditions are based  on the assumption that a cash flow such as an initial investment  can occur now  t        Ordinarily however CF  is zero  We use the formula for the price of an asset to estimate the intrinsic value of an  asset   For ease of reference assume that the asset we are valuing is a share of HSBC  Holdings  parent of HSBC Bank  a British company that also trades on the Hong  Kong Stock Exchange  In the case of corporate stock  there is no expiration date so  T could be extremely large meaning we will need to estimate a large number of cash  flows and rates of return  Fortunately the denominator reduces the importance of  distant cash flows  so it may be sufficient to estimate say    annual cash flows and     rates of returns   How much will HSBC earn next year and the year after next  What  will the banking sector look like in five years  time  Different analysts and investors  will have their own estimates that may be quite different from one another  Also as  we delve further into the future more serious issues in estimating future revenue  expenses  and growth rates arise  Therefore to assume that cash flow estimates for  HSBC will vary among these investors is reasonable  In addition to the numerator   cash flows  it is also necessary to estimate the denominator the required rates of  return  We know that riskier companies will require higher returns because risk and  return are positively correlated  HSBC stock is riskier than a risk  free asset  but by  how much  And what should the compensation for that additional risk be  Again  it is evident that different analysts will view the riskiness of HSBC differently and  therefore arrive at different required rates of return  HSBC closed at HK       on    December      on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange   The traded price represents the value that a marginal investor attaches to a share of  HSBC  say corresponding to Analyst A s expectation  Analyst B may think that the  price should be HK    however and Analyst C may think that the price should be  HK      Given a current price of HK       the expected returns of HSBC are quite  different for the three analysts   Analyst B who believes the price should be HK     concludes that HSBC is overvalued and may assign a weight of zero to HSBC in the  recommended portfolio even though the market capitalization of HSBC is in excess  of HK   trillion  In contrast  Analyst C  with a valuation of HK     thinks HSBC is  undervalued and will significantly overweight HSBC in a portfolio  Our discussion illustrates that analysts can arrive at different valuations that  necessitate the assignment of different asset weights in a portfolio  Given the existence  of many asset classes and numerous assets in each asset class  one can visualize that
1,317,   
2,317,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,317,each investor will have his or her own optimal risky portfolio depending on his or her  assumptions underlying the valuation computations   Therefore market participants  will have their own and possibly different optimal risky portfolios   If investors have different valuations of assets  then the construction of a unique  optimal risky portfolio is not possible  If we make a simplifying assumption of homoge  neity in investor expectations  we will have a single optimal risky portfolio as previously  mentioned  Even if investors have different expectations  market prices are a proxy  of what the marginal informed investor expects  and the market portfolio becomes  the base case the benchmark  or the reference portfolio that other portfolios can be  judged against   For HSBC  the market price is HK       per share and the market  capitalization is HK      trillion  In constructing the market portfolio HSBC  s weight  in the market portfolio will be equal to its market value divided by the value of all  other assets included in the market portfolio 
4,317,    The Capital Market Line
5,317,In the previous section we discussed how the risk  free asset could be combined with  a risky portfolio to create a capital allocation line  In this section we discuss a specific  CAL that uses the market portfolio as the optimal risky portfolio and is known as  the capital market line  We also discuss the significance of the market portfolio and  applications of the capital market line 
6,317,      Passive and Active Portfolios
7,317,In the above subsection we arrived at three possible valuations for each share of  HSBC  HK    HK       and HK      Which one is correct  If the market is an informationally efficient market the price in the market   HK       is an unbiased estimate of all future discounted cash flows  recall the for  mula for the price of an asset   In other words  the price aggregates and reflects all  information that is publicly available and investors cannot expect to earn a return that  is greater than the required rate of return for that asset   If however the price reflects  all publicly available information and there is no way to outperform the market  then  there is little point in investing time and money in evaluating HSBC to arrive at your  price using your own estimates of cash flows and rates of return  In that case a simple and convenient approach to investing is to rely on the prices  set by the market  Portfolios that are based on the assumption of unbiased market prices  are referred to as passive portfolios   Passive portfolios most commonly replicate and  track market indexes  which are passively constructed on the basis of market prices  and market capitalizations   Examples of market indexes are the S P     Index  the  Nikkei     and the CAC     Passive portfolios based on market indexes are called  index funds and generally have low costs because no significant effort is expended in  valuing securities that are included in an index   In contrast to passive investors  reliance on market prices and index funds  active  investors may not rely on market valuations   They have more confidence in their own  ability to estimate cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates   Based on these esti  mates  they value assets and determine whether an asset is fairly valued  In an actively  managed portfolio assets that are undervalued or have a chance of offering above   normal returns  will have a positive weight  i e  overweight compared to the market  weight in the benchmark index  whereas other assets will have a zero weight  or even  a negative weight if short selling is permitted  i e  some assets will be underweighted  compared with the market weight in the benchmark index   This style of investing  is called active investment management  and the portfolios are referred to as active  portfolios   Most open  end mutual funds and hedge funds practice active investment  management  and most analysts believe that active investing adds value  Whether  these analysts are right or wrong is the subject of continuing debate

3,318,      What Is the  Market  
4,318,In the previous discussion we referred to the  market  on numerous occasions without  actually defining the market   The optimal risky portfolio and the capital market line  depend on the definition of the market   So what is the market  Theoretically the market includes all risky assets or anything that has value which  includes stocks  bonds  real estate and even human capital  Not all assets are tradable  however and not all tradable assets are investable  For example the Taj Mahal in India  is an asset but is not a tradable asset   Similarly human capital is an asset that is not  tradable  Moreover assets may be tradable but not investable because of restrictions  placed on certain kinds of investors   For example all stocks listed on the Shanghai  Stock Exchange are tradable  Class A shares  however are available only to domestic  investors  whereas Class B shares are available to both domestic and foreign investors    For investors not domiciled in China  Class A shares are not investable that is  they  are not available for investment   If we consider all stocks  bonds  real estate assets  commodities  etc  probably  hundreds of thousands of assets are tradable and investable  The  market  should  contain as many assets as possible  we emphasize the word  possible  because it is not  practical to include all assets in a single risky portfolio  Even though advancements in  technology and interconnected markets have made it much easier to span the major  equity markets  we are still not able to easily invest in other kinds of assets like bonds  and real estate except in the most developed countries   For the rest of this reading  we will define the  market  quite narrowly because it is  practical and convenient to do so  Typically a local or regional stock market index is  used as a proxy for the market because of active trading in stocks and because a local  or regional market is most visible to the local investors   For our purposes  we will use  the S P     Index as the market s proxy  The S P     is commonly used by analysts  as a benchmark for market performance throughout the United States   It contains      of the largest stocks that are domiciled in the United States  and these stocks are  weighted by their market capitalization  price times the number of outstanding shares   The stocks in the S P     account for approximately    percent of the total equity  market capitalization in the United States  and because the US stock markets represent  about     percent of the world markets  the S P     represents roughly     percent  of worldwide publicly traded equity  Our definition of the market does not include  non  US stock markets  bond markets  real estate and many other asset classes  and  therefore  market  return and the  market  risk premium refer to US equity return and  the US equity risk premium respectively  The use of this proxy however is sufficient  for our discussion and is relatively easy to expand to include other tradable assets  
5,318,      The Capital Market Line  CML 
6,318,A capital allocation line includes all possible combinations of the risk  free asset and  an investor  s optimal risky portfolio  The capital market line is a special case of the  capital allocation line where the risky portfolio is the market portfolio  The risk  free  asset is a debt security with no default risk  no inflation risk  no liquidity risk  no  interest rate risk  and no risk of any other kind  US Treasury bills are usually used as  a proxy of the risk  free return Rf  The S P     is a proxy of the market portfolio which is the optimal risky portfolio   Therefore the expected return on the risky portfolio is the expected market return  expressed as E Rm   The capital market line is shown in Exhibit   where the standard  deviation   p  or total risk  is on the x axis and expected portfolio return E Rp  is on  the y axis   Graphically the market portfolio is the point on the Markowitz efficient  frontier where a line from the risk  free asset is tangent to the Markowitz efficient  frontier  All points on the interior of the Markowitz efficient frontier are inefficient  portfolios in that they provide the same level of return with a higher level of risk or
1,319,   
2,319,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,319,a lower level of return with the same amount of risk   When plotted together the  point at which the CML is tangent to the Markowitz efficient frontier is the optimal  combination of risky assets  on the basis of market prices and market capitalizations    The optimal risky portfolio is the market portfolio

6,322,Mr  Miles decides to set aside a small part of his wealth for investment in a  portfolio that has greater risk than his previous investments because he antic  ipates that the overall market will generate attractive returns in the future  He  assumes that he can borrow money at    percent and achieve the same return  on the S P     as before  an expected return of     percent with a standard  deviation of    percent   Calculate his expected risk and return if he borrows    percent     percent   and     percent of his initial investment amount

5,324,Mr  Miles approaches his broker to borrow money against securities held in  his portfolio  Even though Mr  Miles  loan will be secured by the securities in  his portfolio the broker  s rate for lending to customers is   percent   Assuming  a risk  free rate of   percent and a market return of    percent with a standard  deviation of    percent estimate Mr  Miles  expected return and risk if he invests      percent and     percent in the risk  free asset and if he decides to borrow     percent and    percent of his initial investment and invest the money in the  market

7,324,The unleveraged portfolio s standard deviation and return are calculated using  the same equations as before  E Rp    w Rf        w  E Rm  and  p        w   m The results are unchanged  The slope of the line for the unleveraged portfolio  is      just as before  Return with    percent invested in the market                                       Standard deviation with    percent invested in the market                     Return with    percent invested in the market                                        Standard deviation with    percent invested in the market                      For the leveraged portfolio everything remains the same except that Rf is  replaced with Rb  E Rp    w Rb        w  E Rm  and  p        w   m  Return with     percent invested in T  bills                                         Standard deviation with     percent invested in T  bills                     Return with     percent invested in T  bills                                         Standard deviation with     percent invested in T  bills                    
8,324,The risk and return of the leveraged portfolio is higher than that of the unlev  eraged portfolio  As Mr  Miles borrows more money to invest in the market  the  expected return increases but so does the standard deviation of the portfolio   The slope of the line for the leveraged portfolio is      compared with      for  the unleveraged portfolio which means that for every   percent increase in risk   the investor gets a       percent increase in expected return in the leveraged

5,325,PRICING OF RISK AND COMPUTATION OF EXPECTED  RETURN
6,325,In constructing a portfolio it is important to understand the concept of correlation  and how less than perfect correlation can diversify the risk of a portfolio  As a conse  quence the risk of an asset held alone may be greater than the risk of that same asset  when it is part of a portfolio  Because the risk of an asset varies from one environment  to another which kind of risk should an investor consider and how should that risk  be priced  This section addresses the question of pricing of risk by decomposing  the total risk of a security or a portfolio into systematic and nonsystematic risk   The  meaning of these risks  how they are computed and their relevance to the pricing of  assets are also discussed 
7,325,    Systematic Risk and Nonsystematic Risk
8,325,Systematic risk  also known as non  diversifiable or market risk  is the risk that affects  the entire market or economy  In contrast  nonsystematic risk is the risk that pertains  to a single company or industry and is also known as company  specific industry   specific diversifiable or idiosyncratic risk   Systematic risk is risk that cannot be avoided and is inherent in the overall market   It is non  diversifiable because it includes risk factors that are innate within the market  and affect the market as a whole  Examples of factors that constitute systematic risk  include interest rates  inflation economic cycles  political uncertainty and widespread  natural disasters   These events affect the entire market  and there is no way to avoid  their effect   Systematic risk can be magnified through selection or by using leverage  or diminished by including securities that have a low correlation with the portfolio  assuming they are not already part of the portfolio  Nonsystematic risk is risk that is local or limited to a particular asset or industry  that need not affect assets outside of that asset class   Examples of nonsystematic risk  could include the failure of a drug trial major oil discoveries  or an airliner crash  All  these events will directly affect their respective companies and possibly industries   but have no effect on assets that are far removed from these industries   Investors are  capable of avoiding nonsystematic risk through diversification by forming a portfolio  of assets that are not highly correlated with one another  We will derive expressions for each kind of risk later in this reading   You will  see that the sum of systematic variance and nonsystematic variance equals the total  variance of the security or portfolio  Total variance   Systematic variance   Nonsystematic variance Although the equality relationship is between variances  you will find frequent  references to total risk as the sum of systematic risk and nonsystematic risk   In those  cases  the statements refer to variance not standard deviation 
1,326,Pricing of Risk and Computation of Expected Return
2,326,   
3,326,      Pricing of Risk
4,326,Pricing or valuing an asset is equivalent to estimating its expected rate of return  If  an asset has a known terminal value such as the face value of a bond then a lower  current price implies a higher future return and a higher current price implies a lower  future return  The relationship between price and return can also be observed in the  valuation expression shown in Section        Therefore we will occasionally use price  and return interchangeably when discussing the price of risk   Consider an asset with both systematic and nonsystematic risk   Assume that both  kinds of risk are priced that is  you receive a return for both systematic risk and non  systematic risk   What will you do  Realizing that nonsystematic risk can be diversified  away you would buy assets that have a large amount of nonsystematic risk   Once you  have bought those assets with nonsystematic risk  you would diversify or reduce that  risk  by including other assets that are not highly correlated  In the process  you will  minimize nonsystematic risk and eventually eliminate it altogether from your portfolio   Now you would have a diversified portfolio with only systematic risk  yet you would  be compensated for nonsystematic risk that you no longer have  Just like everyone else  you would have an incentive to take on more and more diversifiable risk because you  are compensated for it even though you can get rid of it   The demand for diversifiable  risk will keep increasing until its price becomes infinite and its expected return falls  to zero  This means that our initial assumption of a non  zero return for diversifiable  risk was incorrect and that the correct assumption is zero return for diversifiable risk    Therefore we can assume that in an efficient market  no incremental reward can be  earned for taking on diversifiable risk   In the previous exercise we illustrated why investors should not be compensated  for taking on nonsystematic risk   Therefore investors who have nonsystematic risk  must diversify it away by investing in many industries  many countries  and many  asset classes   Because future returns are unknown and it is not possible to pick only  winners  diversification helps in offsetting poor returns in one asset class by garnering  good returns in another asset class  thereby reducing the overall risk of the portfolio   In contrast  investors must be compensated for accepting systematic risk because that  risk cannot be diversified away  If investors do not receive a return commensurate with  the amount of systematic risk they are taking  they will refuse to accept systematic risk   In summary systematic or non  diversifiable risk is priced and investors are com  pensated for holding assets or portfolios based only on that investment s systematic  risk   Investors do not receive any return for accepting nonsystematic or diversifiable  risk   Therefore it is in the interest of risk  averse investors to hold only well  diversified  portfolios  
5,326,EXAMPLE  
6,326,Systematic and Nonsystematic Risk
7,326,  Describe the systematic and nonsystematic risk components of the follow  ing assets   A A risk  free asset  such as a three  month Treasury bill B The market portfolio such as the S P     with total risk of     percent   Consider two assets  A and B  Asset A has total risk of    percent  half  of which is nonsystematic risk   Asset B has total risk of    percent  all of  which is systematic risk   Which asset should have a higher expected rate  of return 
1,327,   
2,327,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,327,Solution to  A 
4,327,By definition a risk  free asset has no risk   Therefore a risk  free asset has zero  systematic risk and zero nonsystematic risk  
5,327,Solution to  B 
6,327,As we mentioned earlier a market portfolio is a diversified portfolio one in which  no more risk can be diversified away  We have also described it as an efficient  portfolio  Therefore a market portfolio does not contain any nonsystematic risk    All of its total risk     percent  is systematic risk  
7,327,Solution to   
8,327,The amount of systematic risk in Asset A is     percent  and the amount of  systematic risk in Asset B is    percent   Because only systematic risk is priced  or receives a return the expected rate of return must be higher for Asset B 
9,327,    Calculation and Interpretation of Beta
10,327,As previously mentioned in order to form the market portfolio you should combine  all available risky assets   Knowledge of the correlations among those assets allows us  to estimate portfolio risk   You also learned that a fully diversified portfolio will include  all asset classes and essentially all assets in those asset classes   The work required for  construction of the market portfolio is formidable  For example for a portfolio of       assets  we will need      return estimates       standard deviation estimates   and                           correlations   Other related questions that arise with  this analysis are whether we really need all      assets and what happens if there are  errors in these estimates   An alternate method of constructing an optimal portfolio is simpler and easier to  implement   An investor begins with a known portfolio such as the S P     and then  adds other assets one at a time on the basis of the asset s standard deviation expected  return and impact on the portfolio s risk and return  This process continues until the  addition of another asset does not have a significant impact on the performance of  the portfolio  The process requires only estimates of systematic risk for each asset  because investors will not be compensated for nonsystematic risk   Expected returns  can be calculated by using return  generating models  as we will discuss in this sec  tion  In addition to using return  generating models  we will also decompose total  variance into systematic variance and nonsystematic variance and establish a formal  relationship between systematic risk and return  In the next section we will expand  on this discussion and introduce the CAPM as the preferred return  generating model 
11,327,      Return  Generating Models
12,327,A return  generating model is a model that can provide an estimate of the expected  return of a security given certain parameters   If systematic risk is the only relevant  parameter for return then the return  generating model will estimate the expected  return for any asset given the level of systematic risk   As with any model the quality of estimates of expected return will depend on  the quality of input estimates and the accuracy of the model  Because it is difficult to  decide which factors are appropriate for generating returns  the most general form  of a return  generating model is a multi  factor model  A multi  factor model allows  more than one variable to be considered in estimating returns and can be built using  different kinds of factors  such as macroeconomic fundamental and statistical factors   Macroeconomic factor models use economic factors that are correlated with  security returns   These factors may include economic growth the interest rate the  inflation rate productivity employment and consumer confidence  Past relationships
1,328,Pricing of Risk and Computation of Expected Return
2,328,   
3,328,with returns are estimated to obtain parameter estimates  which are in turn used  for computing expected returns   Fundamental factor models analyze and use rela  tionships between security returns and the company  s underlying fundamentals   such as  for example earnings  earnings growth cash flow generation investment  in research advertising  and number of patents   Finally in a statistical factor model  historical and cross  sectional return data are analyzed to identify factors that explain  variance or covariance in observed returns   These statistical factors  however may or  may not have an economic or fundamental connection to returns   For example the  conference to which the American football Super Bowl winner belongs  whether the  American Football Conference or the National Football Conference may be a factor  in US stock returns  but no obvious economic connection seems to exist between the  winner  s conference and US stock returns   Moreover data mining may generate many  spurious factors that are devoid of any economic meaning   Because of this limitation  analysts prefer the macroeconomic and fundamental factor models for specifying and  estimating return  generating models   A general return  generating model is expressed in the following manner

3,329,      Decomposition of Total Risk for a Single  Index Model
4,329,With the introduction of return  generating models  particularly the single  index  model we are able to decompose total variance into systematic and nonsystematic  variances   Instead of using expected returns in the single index  let us use realized  returns   The difference between expected returns and realized returns is attributable  to non  market changes  as an error term ei in the second equation below   E Ri    Rf    i E Rm    Rf  and Ri   Rf    i Rm   Rf    ei The variance of realized returns can be expressed in the equation below  note that  Rf is a constant   We can further drop the covariance term in this equation because  by definition any non  market return is uncorrelated with the market   Thus  we are  able to decompose total variance into systematic and nonsystematic variances in the  second equation below

38,329,Because nonsystematic risk is zero for well  diversified portfolios  such as the  market portfolio the total risk of a market portfolio and other similar portfolios is  only systematic risk  which is  i m  We can now return to the CML discussed in the  previous subsection and replace  i with  i m because the CML assumes that the  market is a diversified portfolio  By making this substitution for the above equation  we get the following single  index model

72,329,      Return  Generating Models  The Market Model
73,329,The most common implementation of a single  index model is the market model in  which the market return is the single factor or single index   In principle the market  model and the single  index model are similar  The difference is that the market model  is easier to work with and is normally used for estimating beta risk and computing  abnormal returns   The market model is Ri    i    iRm   ei To be consistent with the previous section  i   Rf         The intercept   i and  slope coefficient   i can be estimated by using historical security and market returns    These parameter estimates are then used to predict company  specific returns that a  security may earn in a future period  Assume that a regression of Wal  Mart s histor  ical daily returns on S P     daily returns gives an  i of        and a  i of      Thus

4,330,      Calculation and Interpretation of Beta
5,330,We begin with the single  index model introduced in Section       using realized  returns and rewrite it as Ri         i Rf    i   Rm   ei Because systematic risk depends on the correlation between the asset and the market   we can arrive at a measure of systematic risk from the covariance between Ri and Rm  where Ri is defined using the above equation  Note that the risk  free rate is a constant   so the first term in Ri drops out

49,330,The above formula shows the expression for beta   i which is similar to the fac  tor loading in the single  index model presented in Section        For example if the  correlation between an asset and the market is      and the asset and market have  standard deviations of return of      and      respectively the asset s beta would  be                            If the asset s covariance with the market and market  variance were given as          and         respectively the calculation would be                            The beta in the market model includes an adjustment for  the correlation between asset i and the market because the market model covers all  assets whereas the CML works only for fully diversified portfolios   As shown in the above equation beta is a measure of how sensitive an asset s  return is to the market as a whole and is calculated as the covariance of the return  on i and the return on the market divided by the variance of the market return  that  expression is equivalent to the product of the asset s correlation with the market with  a ratio of standard deviations of return  i e  the ratio of the asset s standard deviation  to the market s   As we have shown beta captures an asset s systematic risk  or the  portion of an asset s risk that cannot be eliminated by diversification  The variances and  correlations required for the calculation of beta are usually based on historical returns   A positive beta indicates that the return of an asset follows the general market  trend whereas a negative beta shows that the return of an asset generally follows a  trend that is opposite to that of the market   In other words  a positive beta indicates  that the return of an asset moves in the same direction of the market  whereas a  negative beta indicates that the return of an asset moves in the opposite direction of  the market   A risk  free asset s beta is zero because its covariance with other assets is  zero  In other words  a beta of zero indicates that the asset s return has no correlation

17,331,EXAMPLE  
18,331,Calculation of Beta
19,331,Assuming that the risk  standard deviation  of the market is    percent calculate  the beta for the following assets     A short  term US Treasury bill    Gold which has a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation of  the market but a zero correlation with the market     A new emerging market that is not currently included in the definition of   market  the emerging market s standard deviation is    percent  and  the correlation with the market is         An initial public offering or new issue of stock with a standard deviation  of    percent and a correlation with the market of      IPOs are usually  very risky but have a relatively low correlation with the market

33,331,An alternative and more practical approach is to estimate beta directly by using the  market model described above  The market model Ri    i    iRm   ei is estimated by  using regression analysis  which is a statistical process that evaluates the relationship

3,332,between a given variable  the dependent variable  and one or more other  indepen  dent  variables   Historical security returns  Ri  and historical market returns  Rm  are  inputs used for estimating the two parameters  i and  i  Regression analysis is similar to plotting all combinations of the asset s return  and the market return  Ri Rm  and then drawing a line through all points such that it  minimizes the sum of squared linear deviations from the line  Exhibit   illustrates the  market model and the estimated parameters   The intercept   i  sometimes referred  to as the constant  and the slope term  i are all that is needed to define the security  characteristic line and obtain beta estimates

20,332,Although beta estimates are important for forecasting future levels of risk  there  is much concern about their accuracy  In general shorter periods of estimation  e g       months  represent betas that are closer to the asset s current level of systematic  risk   Shorter period beta estimates  however are also less accurate than beta estimates  measured over three to five years because they may be affected by special events in that  short period  Although longer period beta estimates are more accurate they may be  a poor representation of future expectations  especially if major changes in the asset  have occurred  Therefore it is necessary to recognize that estimates of beta  whether  obtained through calculation or regression analysis  may or may not represent current  or future levels of an asset s systematic risk  
21,332,      Beta and Expected Return
22,332,Although the single  index model also called the capital asset pricing model  CAPM   will be discussed in greater detail in the next section we will use the CAPM in this  section to estimate returns  given asset betas   The CAPM is usually written with the  risk  free rate on the right  hand side  E Ri    Rf    i E Rm    Rf 
1,333,   
2,333,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,333,The model shows that the primary determinant of expected return for a security is  its beta  or how well the security correlates with the market   The higher the beta of  an asset  the higher its expected return will be  Assets with a beta greater than   have  an expected return that is higher than the market return whereas assets with a beta  of less than   have an expected return that is less than the market return  In certain cases  assets may require a return less than the risk  free return  For  example if an asset s beta is negative the required return will be less than the risk   free rate  When combined with the market  the asset reduces the risk of the overall  portfolio which makes the asset very valuable  Insurance is one such asset   Insurance  gives a positive return when the insured s wealth is reduced because of a catastrophic  loss   In the absence of such a loss or when the insured s wealth is growing  the insured  is required to pay an insurance premium  Thus  insurance has a negative beta and a  negative expected return but helps in reducing overall risk

8,334,THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
9,334,The capital asset pricing model is one of the most significant innovations in portfolio  theory  The model is simple yet powerful  is intuitive yet profound  and uses only  one factor yet is broadly applicable  The CAPM was introduced independently by  William Sharpe John Lintner Jack Treynor and Jan Mossin and builds on Harry  Markowitz  s earlier work on diversification and modern portfolio theory   The model  provides a linear expected return beta relationship that precisely determines the  expected return given the beta of an asset   In doing so it makes the transition from  total risk to systematic risk  the primary determinant of expected return  Recall the  following equation  E Ri    Rf    i E Rm    Rf  The CAPM asserts that the expected returns of assets vary only by their systematic  risk as measured by beta   Two assets with the same beta will have the same expected  return irrespective of the nature of those assets   Given the relationship between risk  and return all assets are defined only by their beta risk  which we will explain as the  assumptions are described  In the remainder of this section we will examine the assumptions made in arriving  at the CAPM and the limitations those assumptions entail  Second we will implement  the CAPM through the security market line to price any portfolio or asset  both effi  cient and inefficient   Finally we will discuss ways in which the CAPM can be applied  to investments  valuation and capital budgeting  
10,334,    Assumptions of the CAPM
11,334,Similar to all other models  the CAPM ignores many of the complexities of financial  markets by making simplifying assumptions   These assumptions allow us to gain  important insights into how assets are priced without complicating the analysis   Once
12,334,  See for example Markowitz        Sharpe        Lintner      a      b  Treynor             and  Mossin        
13,334, 
1,335,   
2,335,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,335,the basic relationships are established we can relax the assumptions and examine how  our insights need to be altered  Some of these assumptions are constraining  whereas  others are benign  And other assumptions affect only a particular set of assets or only  marginally affect the hypothesized relationships    
4,335,Investors are risk  averse utility  maximizing rational individuals 
5,335,Risk aversion means that investors expect to be compensated for accepting risk    Note that the assumption does not require investors to have the same degree of  risk aversion  it only requires that they are averse to risk   Utility maximization  implies that investors want higher returns  not lower returns  and that inves  tors always want more wealth  i e  investors are never satisfied   Investors are  understood to be rational in that they correctly evaluate and analyze available  information to arrive at rational decisions   Although rational investors may  use the same information to arrive at different estimates of expected risk and  expected returns  homogeneity among investors  see Assumption    requires  that investors be rational individuals    Risk aversion and utility maximization are generally accepted as reflecting a  realistic view of the world  Yet  rationality among investors has been questioned  because investors may allow their personal biases and experiences to disrupt  their decision making  resulting in suboptimal investments   Nonetheless  the  model s results are unaffected by such irrational behavior as long as it does not  affect prices in a significant manner  i e  the trades of irrational investors cancel  each other or are dominated by the trades of rational investors  
6,335,  Markets are frictionless including no transaction costs and no taxes 
7,335,Frictionless markets allow us to abstract the analysis from the operational  characteristics of markets   In doing so we do not allow the risk return rela  tionship to be affected by for example the trading volume on the New York  Stock Exchange or the difference between buying and selling prices   Specifically  frictionless markets do not have transaction costs  taxes  or any costs or restric  tions on short selling   We also assume that borrowing and lending at the risk   free rate is possible    The transaction costs of many large institutions are negligible and many  institutions do not pay taxes   Even the presence of non  zero transaction costs   taxes  or the inability to borrow at the risk  free rate does not materially affect  the general conclusions of the CAPM  Costs of short selling  or restrictions on  short selling  however can introduce an upward bias in asset prices  potentially  jeopardizing important conclusions of the CAPM

9,335,    The CAPM is a single  period model and all investor decisions are made on the  basis of that one period  The assumption of a single period is applied for conve  nience because working with multi  period models is more difficult   A single   period model however does not allow learning to occur and bad decisions can  persist   In addition maximizing utility at the end of a multi  period horizon may  require decisions in certain periods that may seem suboptimal when examined  from a single  period perspective  Nonetheless  the single holding period does  not severely limit the applicability of the CAPM to multi  period settings  
10,335, 
11,335,Investors have homogeneous expectations or beliefs 
12,335,  Short selling shares involves selling shares that you do not own  Because you do not own the shares   you  or your broker  must borrow the shares before you can short sell  You sell the borrowed shares in the  market hoping that you will be able to return the borrowed shares by buying them later in the market at a  lower price  Brokerage houses and securities lenders lend shares to you to sell in return for a portion  or  all  of the interest earned on the cash you receive for the shares that are short sold 
1,336,The Capital Asset Pricing Model
2,336,   
3,336,This assumption means that all investors analyze securities in the same way  using the same probability distributions and the same inputs for future cash  flows   In addition given that they are rational individuals  the investors will  arrive at the same valuations   Because their valuations of all assets are identical  they will generate the same optimal risky portfolio which we call the market  portfolio    The assumption of homogeneous beliefs can be relaxed as long as the dif  ferences in expectations do not generate significantly different optimal risky  portfolios  
4,336,  All investments are infinitely divisible 
5,336,This assumption implies that an individual can invest as little or as much as he  or she wishes in an asset   This supposition allows the model to rely on continu  ous functions rather than on discrete jump functions   The assumption is made  for convenience only and has an inconsequential impact on the conclusions of  the model 
6,336,Investors are price takers 
7,336,    The CAPM assumes that there are many investors and that no investor is large  enough to influence prices   Thus  investors are price takers  and we assume that  security prices are unaffected by investor trades   This assumption is generally  true because even though investors may be able to affect prices of small stocks   those stocks are not large enough to affect the primary results of the CAPM 
8,336,The main objective of these assumptions is to create a marginal investor who  rationally chooses a mean variance  efficient portfolio in a predictable fashion  We  assume away any inefficiency in the market from both operational and informational  perspectives   Although some of these assumptions may seem unrealistic relaxing most  of them will have only a minor influence on the model and its results   Moreover the  CAPM with all its limitations and weaknesses  provides a benchmark for comparison  and for generating initial return estimates  
9,336,    The Security Market Line
10,336,In this subsection we apply the CAPM to the pricing of securities   The security market  line  SML  is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model with beta   reflecting systematic risk  on the x axis and expected return on the y axis   Using the  same concept as the capital market line the SML intersects the y axis at the risk  free  rate of return and the slope of this line is the market risk premium Rm   Rf  Recall  that the capital market line  CML  does not apply to all securities or assets but only  to portfolios on the efficient frontier  The efficient frontier gives optimal combinations  of expected return and total risk   In contrast  the security market line applies to any  security efficient or not   Total risk and systematic risk are equal only for efficient  portfolios because those portfolios have no diversifiable risk remaining    Exhibit   is a graphical representation of the CAPM the security market line  As  shown earlier in this reading  the beta of the market is    x axis  and the market earns  an expected return of Rm  y axis   Using this line it is possible to calculate the expected  return of an asset   The next example illustrates the beta and return calculations

5,339,    Applications of the CAPM
6,339,The CAPM offers powerful and intuitively appealing predictions about risk and  the relationship between risk and return  The CAPM is not only important from a  theoretical perspective but is also used extensively in practice  In this section we  will discuss some common applications of the model  When applying these tools to  different scenarios  it is important to understand that the CAPM and the SML are  functions that give an indication of what the return in the market should be given a  certain level of risk   The actual return may be quite different from the expected return  Applications of the CAPM include estimates of the expected return for capital  budgeting  comparison of the actual return of a portfolio or portfolio manager with  the CAPM return for performance appraisal and the analysis of alternate return  estimates and the CAPM returns as the basis for security selection  The applications  are discussed in more detail in this section 
7,339,      Estimate of Expected Return
8,339,Given an asset s systematic risk  the expected return can be calculated using the  CAPM  Recall that the price of an asset is the sum of all future cash flows discounted  at the required rate of return where the discount rate or the required rate of return  is commensurate with the asset s risk   The expected rate of return obtained from  the CAPM is normally the first estimate that investors use for valuing assets  such  as stocks  bonds  real estate and other similar assets   The required rate of return  from the CAPM is also used for capital budgeting and determining the economic  feasibility of projects   Again recall that when computing the net present value of a  project  investments and net revenues are considered cash flows and are discounted  at the required rate of return  The required rate of return based on the project s risk   is calculated using the CAPM  Because risk and return underlie almost all aspects of investment decision making   it is not surprising that the CAPM is used for estimating expected return in many sce  narios   Other examples include calculating the cost of capital for regulated companies  by regulatory commissions and setting fair insurance premiums   The next example  shows an application of the CAPM to capital budgeting

67,340,      Portfolio Performance Evaluation
68,340,Institutional money managers  pension fund managers  and mutual fund managers  manage large amounts of money for other people  Are they doing a good job  How  does their performance compare with a passively managed portfolio that is  one in  which the investor holds just the market portfolio  Evaluating the performance of a  portfolio is of interest to all investors and money managers   Because active manage  ment costs significantly more than passive management we expect active managers to  perform better than passive managers or at least to cover the difference in expenses    For example Fidelity  s passively managed Spartan     Index fund has an expense ratio
1,341,   
2,341,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,341,of only      percent whereas Fidelity  s actively managed Contrafund has an expense  ratio of      percent   Investors need a method for determining whether the manager  of the Contrafund is worth the extra      percent in expenses   In this reading  performance evaluation is based only on the CAPM  However  it is easy to extend this analysis to multi  factor models that may include industry  or other special factors   Four ratios are commonly used in performance evaluation  Sharpe and Treynor Ratios Performance has two components  risk and return   Although return maximization is a laudable objective comparing just the return of a  portfolio with that of the market is not sufficient  Because investors are risk averse they  will require compensation for higher risk in the form of higher returns   A commonly  used measure of performance is the Sharpe ratio which is defined as the portfolio s  risk premium divided by its risk 
4,341,Sharpe ratio  
5,341, R
6,341,p
7,341,R
8,341,f
9,341,p 
10,341,Recalling the CAL from earlier in the reading  one can see that the Sharpe ratio  also called the reward  to  variability ratio is simply the slope of the capital allocation  line  the greater the slope the better the asset   Note however that the ratio uses the  total risk of the portfolio not its systematic risk   The use of total risk is appropriate  if the portfolio is an investor  s total portfolio that is  the investor does not own any  other assets   Sharpe ratios of the market and other portfolios can also be calculated in  a similar manner  The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio has the best performance  and the one with the lowest Sharpe ratio has the worst performance provided that  the numerator is positive for all comparison portfolios   If the numerator is negative  the ratio will be less negative for riskier portfolios  resulting in incorrect rankings   The Sharpe ratio however suffers from two limitations   First  it uses total risk as  a measure of risk when only systematic risk is priced  Second the ratio itself  e g        or      is not informative  To rank portfolios  the Sharpe ratio of one portfolio  must be compared with the Sharpe ratio of another portfolio  Nonetheless  the ease  of computation makes the Sharpe ratio a popular tool  The Treynor ratio is a simple extension of the Sharpe ratio and resolves the Sharpe  ratio s first limitation by substituting beta risk for total risk   The Treynor ratio is

14,341,R
15,341,f
16,341,p 
17,341,Just like the Sharpe ratio the numerators must be positive for the Treynor ratio  to give meaningful results   In addition the Treynor ratio does not work for negative   beta assets that is  the denominator must also be positive for obtaining correct esti  mates and rankings   Although both the Sharpe and Treynor ratios allow for ranking  of portfolios  neither ratio gives any information about the economic significance of  differences in performance  For example assume the Sharpe ratio of one portfolio is       and the Sharpe ratio for another portfolio is       The second portfolio is superior  but is that difference meaningful  In addition we do not know whether either of the  portfolios is better than the passive market portfolio  The remaining two measures  M   and Jensen s alpha  attempt to address that problem by comparing portfolios while also  providing information about the extent of the overperformance or underperformance  M Squared  M    M  was created by Franco Modigliani and his granddaughter Leah  Modigliani hence the name M squared  M  is an extension of the Sharpe ratio in that it  is based on total risk not beta risk   The idea behind the measure is to create a portfolio   P   that mimics the risk of a market portfolio that is  the mimicking portfolio  P    alters the weights in Portfolio P and the risk  free asset until Portfolio P  has the same  total risk as the market  i e   p     m   Because the risks of the mimicking portfolio

2,342,   
3,342,and the market portfolio are the same we can obtain the return on the mimicking  portfolio and directly compare it with the market return  The weight in Portfolio P wp  that makes the risks equal can be calculated as follows

23,344,Let us begin with an analysis of the risk  free asset  Because the risk  free asset  has zero risk and a beta of zero calculating the Sharpe ratio Treynor ratio or  M  is not possible because they all require the portfolio risk in the denominator   The risk  free asset s alpha  however is zero  Turning to the market portfolio we  see that the absolute measures of performance the Sharpe ratio and the Treynor  ratio are positive for the market portfolio  These ratios are positive as long as  the portfolio earns a return that is in excess of that of the risk  free asset   M   and  i are performance measures relative to the market  so they are both equal  to zero for the market portfolio  All three managers have Sharpe and Treynor ratios greater than those of the  market  and all three managers  M  and  i are positive  therefore the pension  fund should be satisfied with their performance  Among the three managers   Manager X has the worst performance irrespective of whether total risk or  systematic risk is considered for measuring performance  The relative rankings  are depicted in Exhibit

36,344,Comparing Y and Z  we can observe that Y performs much better than Z  when total risk is considered  Y has a Sharpe ratio of      compared with a  Sharpe ratio of      for Z   Similarly M  is higher for Y       percent  than for Z        percent   In contrast  when systematic risk is used Z outperforms Y  The  Treynor ratio is higher for Z         than for Y         and Jensen s alpha is also  higher for Z       percent  than for Y       percent  which indicates that Z has  done a better job of generating excess return relative to systematic risk than Y  Exhibit    confirms these observations in that all three managers outperform  the benchmark because all three points lie above the SML   Among the three  portfolios  Z performs the best when we consider risk  adjusted returns because  it is the point in Exhibit     that is located northwest relative to the portfolios  X and Y

32,345,When do we use total risk performance measures like the Sharpe ratio  and M  and when do we use beta risk performance measures like the Treynor  ratio and Jensen s alpha  Total risk is relevant for an investor when he or she  holds a portfolio that is not fully diversified which is not a desirable portfolio   In such cases  the Sharpe ratio and M  are appropriate performance measures    Thus  if the pension fund were to choose only one fund manager to manage all  its assets  it should choose Manager Y  Performance measures relative to beta  risk Treynor ratio and Jensen s alpha are relevant when the investor holds  a well  diversified portfolio with negligible diversifiable risk   In other words  if  the pension fund is well diversified and only the systematic risk of the portfolio  matters  the fund should choose Manager Z  
33,345,The measures of performance evaluation assume that the benchmark market  portfolio is the correct portfolio  As a result  an error in the benchmark may cause  the results to be misleading   For example evaluating a real estate fund against the  S P     is incorrect because real estate has different characteristics than equity  In  addition to errors in benchmarking  errors could occur in the measurement of risk  and return of the market portfolio and the portfolios being evaluated  Finally many  estimates are based on historical data   Any projections based on such estimates assume  that this level of performance will continue in the future 
34,345,      Security Characteristic Line
35,345,Similar to the SML  we can draw a security characteristic line  SCL  for a security   The SCL is a plot of the excess return of the security on the excess return of the market   In Exhibit    Jensen s alpha is the intercept and the beta is the slope  The equation of  the line can be obtained by rearranging the terms in the expression for Jensen s alpha  and replacing the subscript p with i  Ri   Rf    i    i Rm   Rf  As an example the SCL is drawn in Exhibit    using Manager X s portfolio from  Exhibit     The security characteristic line can also be estimated by regressing the  excess security return Ri   Rf on the excess market return Rm   Rf

23,346,When discussing the CAPM we assumed that investors have homogeneous expecta  tions and are rational risk  averse utility  maximizing investors   With these assump  tions  we were able to state that all investors assign the same value to all assets and  therefore have the same optimal risky portfolio which is the market portfolio  In  other words  we assumed that there is commonality among beliefs about an asset s  future cash flows and the required rate of return  Given the required rate of return  we can discount the future cash flows of the asset to arrive at its current value or  price which is agreed upon by all or most investors   In this section we introduce heterogeneity in beliefs of investors   Because inves  tors are price takers  it is assumed that such heterogeneity does not significantly  affect the market price of an asset   The difference in beliefs can relate to future cash  flows  the systematic risk of the asset  or both  Because the current price of an asset  is the discounted value of the future cash flows  the difference in beliefs could result  in an investor  estimated price that is different from the CAPM  calculated price  The  CAPM  calculated price is the current market price because it reflects the beliefs of all  other investors in the market   If the investor  estimated current price is higher  lower   than the market price the asset is considered undervalued  overvalued   Therefore  the CAPM is an effective tool for determining whether an asset is undervalued or  overvalued and whether an investor should buy or sell the asset   Although portfolio performance evaluation is backward looking and security selec  tion is forward looking  we can apply the concepts of portfolio evaluation to security  selection  The best measure to apply is Jensen s alpha because it uses systematic risk  and is meaningful even on an absolute basis   A positive Jensen s alpha indicates a  superior security whereas a negative Jensen s alpha indicates a security that is likely  to underperform the market when adjusted for risk   Another way of presenting the same information is with the security market line   Potential investors can plot a security  s expected return and beta against the SML  and use this relationship to decide whether the security is overvalued or undervalued

28,347,      Constructing a Portfolio
29,347,Based on the CAPM investors should hold a combination of the risk  free asset and the  market portfolio  The true market portfolio consists of a large number of securities   and an investor would have to own all of them in order to be completely diversified   Because owning all existing securities is not practical in this section we will consider  an alternate method of constructing a portfolio that may not require a large number  of securities and will still be sufficiently diversified  Exhibit     shows the reduction  in risk as we add more and more securities to a portfolio  As can be seen from the  exhibit  much of the nonsystematic risk can be diversified away in as few as    secu  rities   These securities  however should be randomly selected and represent different  asset classes for the portfolio to effectively diversify risk   Otherwise one may be better  off using an index  e g   the S P     for a diversified large  cap equity portfolio and  other indexes for other asset classes  
30,347,  In this reading  we do not consider transaction costs  which are important whenever deviations from  a passive portfolio are considered  Thus  the magnitude of undervaluation or overvaluation should be  considered in relation to transaction costs prior to making an investment decision

19,348,Let s begin constructing the optimal portfolio with a portfolio of securities like  the S P      Although the S P     is a portfolio of     securities  it is a good start  ing point because it is readily available as a single security for trading   In contrast  it  represents only the large corporations that are traded on the US stock markets and  therefore does not encompass the global market entirely  Because the S P     is the  base portfolio however we treat it is as the market for the CAPM  Any security not included in the S P     can be evaluated to determine whether it  should be integrated into the portfolio  That decision is based on the   i of the security  which is calculated using the CAPM with the S P     as the market portfolio  Note  that security i may not necessarily be priced incorrectly for it to have a non  zero  i    i can be positive merely because it is not well correlated with the S P     and its  return is sufficient for the amount of systematic risk it contains   For example assume  a new stock market  ABC  opens to foreign investors only and is being considered for  inclusion in the portfolio  We estimate ABC  s model parameters relative to the S P      and find an  i of approximately   percent  with a  i of       Because  i is positive  ABC should be added to the portfolio  Securities with a significantly negative  i may  be short sold to maximize risk  adjusted return  For convenience however we will  assume that negative positions are not permitted in the portfolio  In addition to the securities that are correctly priced but enter the portfolio because  of their risk return superiority securities already in the portfolio  S P      may be  undervalued or overvalued based on investor expectations that are incongruent with  the market   Securities in the S P     that are overvalued  negative  i  should be  dropped from the S P     portfolio if it is possible to exclude individual securities   and positions in securities in the S P     that are undervalued  positive  i  should  be increased  This brings us to the next question  What should the relative weight of securities  in the portfolio be  Because we are concerned with maximizing risk  adjusted return  securities with a higher  i should have a higher weight  and securities with greater  nonsystematic risk should be given less weight in the portfolio  A complete analysis  of portfolio optimization is beyond the scope of this reading  but the following prin  ciples are helpful  The weight in each nonmarket security should be proportional

4,350,Stock P has a negative   and should not be included in the portfolio unless a  negative position can be assumed through short selling   Stocks Q and R have  a positive    therefore they should be included in the portfolio with positive  weights   The relative weight of Q is                     The relative weight of R is                     Stock Q will have the largest weight among the nonmarket securities to be added  to the portfolio  In relative terms  the weight of Q will be      percent greater  than the weight of R                      As the number of securities increases   the analysis becomes more complex   However the contribution of each addi  tional security toward improvement in the risk return trade  off will decrease  and eventually disappear resulting in a well  diversified portfolio 
5,350,BEYOND THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL
6,350,In general return  generating models allow us to estimate an asset s return given its  characteristics  where the asset characteristics required for estimating the return  are specified in the model  Estimating an asset s return is important for investment  decision making   These models are also important as a benchmark for evaluating  portfolio security or manager performance  The return  generating models were  briefly introduced in Section       and one of those models  the capital asset pricing  model was discussed in detail in Section    The purpose of this section is to make readers aware that  although the CAPM is  an important concept and model the CAPM is not the only return  generating model   In this section we revisit and highlight the limitations of the CAPM and preview  return  generating models that address some of those limitations  
7,350,    The CAPM
8,350,The CAPM is a model that simplifies a complex investment environment and allows  investors to understand the relationship between risk and return  Although the  CAPM affords us this insight  its assumptions can be constraining and unrealistic  as mentioned in Section      In Section     we discuss other models that have been  developed along with their own limitations  
9,350,    Limitations of the CAPM
10,350,The CAPM is subject to theoretical and practical limitations   Theoretical limitations  are inherent in the structure of the model whereas practical limitations are those that  arise in implementing the model 
11,350, 
1,351,   
2,351,Reading      Portfolio Risk and Return  Part II
3,351,      Theoretical Limitations of the CAPM
4,351,   Single  factor model  Only systematic risk or beta risk is priced in the CAPM   Thus  the CAPM states that no other investment characteristics should be con  sidered in estimating returns   As a consequence it is prescriptive and easy to  understand and apply although it is very restrictive and inflexible     Single  period model  The CAPM is a single  period model that does not con  sider multi  period implications or investment objectives of future periods   which can lead to myopic and suboptimal investment decisions   For example it  may be optimal to default on interest payments in the current period to maxi  mize current returns  but the consequences may be negative in the next period   A single  period model like the CAPM is unable to capture factors that vary over  time and span several periods  
5,351,      Practical Limitations of the CAPM
6,351,In addition to the theoretical limitations  implementation of the CAPM raises several  practical concerns  some of which are listed below     Market portfolio  The true market portfolio according to the CAPM includes all  assets  financial and nonfinancial which means that it also includes many assets  that are not investable such as human capital and assets in closed economies    Richard Roll  noted that one reason the CAPM is not testable is that the true  market portfolio is unobservable     Proxy for a market portfolio  In the absence of a true market portfolio market  participants generally use proxies   These proxies  however vary among analysts   the country of the investor etc  and generate different return estimates for the  same asset  which is impermissible in the CAPM     Estimation of beta risk   A long history of returns  three to five years  is required  to estimate beta risk   The historical state of the company however may not be  an accurate representation of the current or future state of the company  More  generally the CAPM is an ex ante model yet it is usually applied using ex post  data   In addition using different periods for estimation results in different  estimates of beta   For example a three  year beta is unlikely to be the same as  a five  year beta  and a beta estimated with daily returns is unlikely to be the  same as the beta estimated with monthly returns   Thus  we are likely to estimate  different returns for the same asset depending on the estimate of beta risk used  in the model     The CAPM is a poor predictor of returns   If the CAPM is a good model its  estimate of asset returns should be closely associated with realized returns    However empirical support for the CAPM is weak    In other words  tests of the  CAPM show that asset returns are not determined only by systematic risk   Poor  predictability of returns when using the CAPM is a serious limitation because  return  generating models are used to estimate future returns      Homogeneity in investor expectations   The CAPM assumes that homogeneity  exists in investor expectations for the model to generate a single optimal risky  portfolio  the market  and a single security market line  Without this assump  tion there will be numerous optimal risky portfolios and numerous security  market lines   Clearly investors can process the same information in a rational  manner and arrive at different optimal risky portfolios

3,352,    Extensions to the CAPM
4,352,Given the limitations of the CAPM it is not surprising that other models have been  proposed to address some of these limitations   These new models are not without  limitations of their own which we will mention while discussing the models   We divide  the models into two categories and provide one example of each type 
5,352,      Theoretical Models
6,352,Theoretical models are based on the same principle as the CAPM but expand the  number of risk factors   The best example of a theoretical model is the arbitrage pricing  theory  APT  which was developed by Stephen Ross    Like the CAPM APT proposes  a linear relationship between expected return and risk   E Rp    RF      p           K pK where E Rp    the expected return of portfolio p RF   the risk  free rate  j   the risk premium  expected return in excess of the risk  free rate  for  factor j  pj   the sensitivity of the portfolio to factor j K   the number of risk factors Unlike the CAPM however APT allows numerous risk factors as many as are  relevant to a particular asset   Moreover other than the risk  free rate the risk factors  need not be common and may vary from one asset to another  A no  arbitrage con  dition in asset markets is used to determine the risk factors and estimate betas for  the risk factors   Although it is theoretically elegant  flexible and superior to the CAPM APT is  not commonly used in practice because it does not specify any of the risk factors  and it becomes difficult to identify risk factors and estimate betas for each asset in a  portfolio  So from a practical standpoint  the CAPM is preferred to APT 
7,352,      Practical Models
8,352,If beta risk in the CAPM does not explain returns  which factors do  Practical models  seek to answer this question through extensive research  As mentioned in Section        the best example of such a model is the four  factor model proposed by Fama  and French        and Carhart         Based on an analysis of the relationship between past returns and a variety of  different factors  Fama and French        proposed that three factors seem to explain  asset returns better than just systematic risk   Those three factors are relative size  relative book  to  market value and beta of the asset   With Carhart s        addition  of relative past stock returns  the model can be written as follows

4,353,    The CAPM and Beyond
5,353,The CAPM has limitations and more importantly is ineffective in modeling asset  returns   However it is a simple model that allows us to estimate returns and evaluate  performance  The newer models provide alternatives to the CAPM although they are  not necessarily better in all situations or practical in their application in the real world 
6,353,SUMMARY
7,353,In this reading  we discussed the capital asset pricing model in detail and covered  related topics such as the capital market line  The reading began with an interpretation  of the CML  uses of the market portfolio as a passive management strategy and lever  aging of the market portfolio to obtain a higher expected return  Next  we discussed  systematic and nonsystematic risk and why one should not expect to be compensated  for taking on nonsystematic risk   The discussion of systematic and nonsystematic risk  was followed by an introduction to beta and return  generating models   This broad  topic was then broken down into a discussion of the CAPM and more specifically the  relationship between beta and expected return  The final section included applications  of the CAPM to capital budgeting  portfolio performance evaluation and security  selection  The highlights of the reading are as follows      The capital market line is a special case of the capital allocation line where the  efficient portfolio is the market portfolio     Obtaining a unique optimal risky portfolio is not possible if investors are per  mitted to have heterogeneous beliefs because such beliefs will result in hetero  geneous asset prices

5,366,PORTFOLIO PLANNING
6,366,Portfolio planning can be defined as a program developed in advance of constructing  a portfolio that is expected to satisfy the client s investment objectives   The written  document governing this process is the investment policy statement  IPS  
7,366,    The Investment Policy Statement
8,366,The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process   Without a full  understanding of the client s situation and requirements  it is unlikely that success  ful results will be achieved   Success  can be defined as a client achieving his or her  important investment goals using means that he or she is comfortable with  in terms  of risks taken and other concerns   The IPS essentially communicates a plan for  achieving investment success   The IPS will be developed following a fact finding discussion with the client   This  fact finding discussion can include the use of a questionnaire designed to articulate  the client s risk tolerance as well as specific circumstances   In the case of institutional  clients  the fact finding may involve asset liability management studies  identification  of liquidity needs  and a wide range of tax and legal considerations   The IPS can take a variety of forms   A typical format will include the client s  investment objectives and the constraints that apply to the client s portfolio  The client s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return require  ments   These must be consistent with each other   a client is unlikely to be able to find  a portfolio that offers a relatively high expected return without taking on a relatively  high level of risk   The constraints section covers factors that need to be taken into account when  constructing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives   The typical constraint  categories are liquidity requirements  time horizon regulatory requirements  tax status   and unique needs   The constraints may be internal  i e  set by the client  or external   i e  set by law or regulation   These are discussed in detail below  Having a well constructed IPS for all clients should be standard procedure for a  portfolio manager  The portfolio manager should have the IPS close at hand and be  able to refer to it to assess the suitability of a particular investment for the client   In  some cases  the need for the IPS goes beyond simply being a matter of standard pro  cedure  In some countries  the IPS  or an equivalent document  is a legal or regulatory  requirement   For example UK pension schemes must have a statement of investment  principles under the Pensions Act       Section     and this statement is in essence  an IPS  The UK Financial Conduct Authority  FCA  also has requirements for invest  ment firms to  know their customers    The European Union s Markets in Financial  Instruments Directive   MiFID   requires firms to assign clients to categories  such  as professional clients and retail clients   In the case of an institution such as a pension plan or university endowment  the  IPS may set out the governance arrangements that apply to the investment funds    For example this information could cover the investment committee s approach to  appointing and reviewing investment managers for the portfolio and the discretion

3,367,that those managers have  The IPS could also set out the institution s approach to  corporate governance in terms of how it will approach the use of shareholder voting  rights and other forms of engagement with corporate management   The IPS should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it remains consistent  with the client s circumstances and requirements   For example the UK Pensions  Regulator suggests that a pension scheme s statements of investment principles a  form of IPS should be reviewed at least every three years   The IPS should also be  reviewed if the manager becomes aware of a material change in the client s circum  stances  or on the initiative of the client when his or her objectives  time horizon or  liquidity needs change 
4,367,    Major Components of an IPS
5,367,There is no single standard format for an IPS  Many IPS however include the fol  lowing sections      Introduction  This section describes the client      Statement of Purpose  This section states the purpose of the IPS     Statement of Duties and Responsibilities  This section details the duties and  responsibilities of the client  the custodian of the client s assets  and the invest  ment managers      Procedures  This section explains the steps to take to keep the IPS current and  the procedures to follow to respond to various contingencies      Investment Objectives  This section explains the client s objectives in investing      Investment Constraints  This section presents the factors that constrain the  client in seeking to achieve the investment objectives      Investment Guidelines  This section provides information about how policy  should be executed  e g   on the permissible use of leverage and derivatives  and  on specific types of assets excluded from investment  if any     Evaluation and Review  This section provides guidance on obtaining feedback  on investment results      Appendices   A  Strategic Asset Allocation  B  Rebalancing Policy  Many inves  tors specify a strategic asset allocation  SAA  also known as the policy portfo  lio which is the baseline allocation of portfolio assets to asset classes in view  of the investor  s investment objectives and the investor  s policy with respect to  rebalancing asset class weights   The sections that are most closely linked to the client s distinctive needs  and probably  the most important from a planning perspective are those dealing with investment  objectives and constraints   An IPS focusing on these two elements has been called  an IPS in an  objectives and constraints  format   In the following sections  we discuss the investment objectives and constraints  format of an IPS beginning with risk and return objectives   We follow a tradition of  CFA Institute presentations in discussing risk objectives first   The process of develop  ing the IPS is the basic mechanism for evaluating and trying to improve an investor  s  overall expected return risk stance  In a portfolio context   investors have learned  to appreciate that their objective is not to manage reward but to control and manage  risk    Stated another way return objectives and expectations must be tailored to be  consistent with risk objectives   The risk and return objectives must also be consistent  with the constraints that apply to the portfolio

3,368,      Risk Objectives
4,368,When constructing a portfolio for a client  it is important to ensure that the risk of  the portfolio is suitable for the client   The IPS should state clearly the risk tolerance  of the client   Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk tolerance  of the client   Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute or relative or a combination  of the two  Examples of an absolute risk objective would be a desire not to suffer any loss of  capital or not to lose more than a given percent of capital in any     month period   Note that these objectives are not related to investment market performance good  or bad and are absolute in the sense of being self  standing   The fulfillment of such  objectives could be achieved by not taking any risk   for example by investing in an  insured bank certificate of deposit at a credit  worthy bank   If investments in risky assets  are undertaken however such statements would need to be restated as a probability  statement to be operational  i e  practically useful   For example the desire not to  lose more than   percent of capital in any     month period might be restated as an  objective that with    percent probability the portfolio not lose more than   percent  in any     month period  Measures of absolute risk include the variance or standard  deviation of returns and value at risk    Some clients may choose to express relative risk objectives  which relate risk relative  to one or more benchmarks perceived to represent appropriate risk standards   For  example investments in large  cap UK equities could be benchmarked to an equity  market index  such as the FTSE     Index   The S P     Index could be used as a  benchmark for large  cap US equities  or for investments with cash  like characteris  tics  the benchmark could be an interest rate such as Libor or a Treasury bill rate  For  risk relative to a benchmark  the relevant measure is tracking risk  or tracking error   For institutional clients  the benchmark may be linked to some form of liability the  institution has   For example a pension plan must meet the pension payments as they  come due and the risk objective will be to minimize the probability that it will fail to  do so   A related return objective might be to outperform the discount rate used in  finding the present value of liabilities over a multi  year time horizon   When a policy portfolio  that is  a specified set of long  term asset class weight  ings  is used the risk objective may be expressed as a desire for the portfolio return  to be within a band of plus or minus X percent of the benchmark return calculated  by assigning an index or benchmark to represent each asset class present in the policy  portfolio  Again this objective has to be interpreted as a statement of probability   for  example a     percent probability that the portfolio return will be within X percent  of the benchmark return over a stated time period  Example   reviews this material 
5,368,EXAMPLE  
6,368,Types of Risk Objectives
7,368,A Japanese institutional investor has a portfolio valued at     billion  The inves  tor expresses his first risk objective as a desire not to lose more than    billion  in the coming     month period  The investor specifies a second risk objective
8,368,  Value at risk is a money measure of the minimum value of losses expected during a specified time  period at a given level of probability    Tracking risk  sometimes called tracking error  is the standard deviation of the differences between a  portfolio s returns and its benchmark s returns  
1,369,Portfolio Planning

3,369,of achieving returns within   percent of the return to the TOPIX stock market  index  which is the investor  s benchmark   Based on this information address  the following    A Characterize the first risk objective as absolute or relative  B Give an example of how the risk objective could be restated in a prac  tical manner    A Characterize the second risk objective as absolute or relative  B  Identify a measure for quantifying the risk objective 
4,369,Solutions to   
5,369,A This is an absolute risk objective  B This risk objective could be restated in a practical manner by specifying  that the     month    percent value at risk of the portfolio must not be  more than    billion 
6,369,Solutions to   
7,369,A This is a relative risk objective  B This risk objective could be quantified using the tracking risk as a mea  sure  For example assuming returns follow a normal distribution an  expected tracking risk of   percent would imply a return within   percent  of the index return approximately    percent of the time  Remember that  tracking risk is stated as a one standard deviation measure 
8,369,A client s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client s ability to bear  accept   risk and his or her  risk attitude  which might be considered as the client s willingness  to take risk   For ease of expression from this point on we will refer to ability to bear  risk and willingness to take risk as the two components of risk tolerance  Above average  ability to bear risk and above average willingness to take risk imply above average risk  tolerance  Below average ability to bear risk and below average willingness to take risk  imply below average risk tolerance  The ability to bear risk is measured mainly in terms of objective factors  such  as time horizon expected income and the level of wealth relative to liabilities   For  example an investor with a     year time horizon can be considered to have a greater  ability to bear risk  other things being equal than an investor with a    year horizon   This difference is because over    years there is more scope for losses to be recovered  or other adjustments to circumstances to be made than there is over   years   Similarly an investor whose assets are comfortably in excess of their liabilities has  more ability to bear risk than an investor whose wealth and expected future expen  diture are more closely balanced  For example a wealthy individual who can sustain  a comfortable lifestyle after a very substantial investment loss has a relatively high  ability to bear risk   A pension plan that has a large surplus of assets over liabilities  has a relatively high ability to bear risk   Risk attitude or willingness to take risk  is a more subjective factor based on the  client s psychology and perhaps also his or her current circumstances   Although the  list of factors that are related to an individual s risk attitude remains open to debate  it is believed that some psychological factors  such as personality type self  esteem  and inclination to independent thinking  are correlated with risk attitude  Some  individuals are comfortable taking financial and investment risk  whereas others find  it distressing   Although there is no single agreed  upon method for measuring risk  tolerance a willingness to take risk may be gauged by discussing risk with the client or
1,370,   
2,370,Reading      Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction
3,370,by asking the client to complete a psychometric questionnaire  For example financial  planning academic John Grable and collaborators have developed     item and    item  risk attitude questionnaires that have undergone some level of technical validation   The five  item questionnaire is shown in Exhibit

11,370,The responses  a  b  c  and d  are coded       and   respectively and summed   The lowest score is   and the highest score is    with higher scores indicating greater  risk tolerance  For two random samples drawn from the faculty and staff of large US  universities  n        the mean score was       with a standard deviation of       and a median score of     Note that a question such as the first one in Exhibit   indicates that risk attitude  may be associated with non  psychological factors  such as level of financial knowl  edge and understanding and decision  making style  as well as psychological factors  
1,371,Portfolio Planning
2,371,   
3,371,The adviser needs to examine whether a client s ability to accept risk is consistent  with the client s willingness to take risk   For example a wealthy investor with a      year time horizon who is thus able to take risk  may also be comfortable taking risk    in this case the factors are consistent   If the wealthy investor has a low willingness to  take risk  there would be a conflict   In the institutional context  there could also be conflict between ability and will  ingness to take risk   In addition different stakeholders within the institution may  take different views   For example the trustees of a well  funded pension plan may  desire a low  risk approach to safeguard the funding of the scheme and beneficiaries  of the scheme may take a similar view  The sponsor however may wish a higher  risk  higher  return approach in an attempt to reduce future funding costs   When a trustee  bears a fiduciary responsibility to pension beneficiaries and the interests of the pen  sion sponsor and the pension beneficiaries conflict  the trustee should act in the best  interests of the beneficiaries   When ability to take risk and willingness to take risk are consistent the investment  adviser  s task is the simplest  When ability to take risk is below average and willingness  to take risk is above average the investor  s risk tolerance should be assessed as below  average overall  When ability to take risk is above average but willingness is below  average the portfolio manager or adviser may seek to counsel the client and explain  the conflict and its implications   For example the adviser could outline the reasons  why the client is considered to have a high ability to take risk and explain the likely  consequences  in terms of reduced expected return of not taking risk   The investment  adviser however should not aim to change a client s willingness to take risk that is not  a result of a miscalculation or misperception  Modification of elements of personality  is not within the purview of the investment adviser  s role  The prudent approach is to  reach a conclusion about risk tolerance consistent with the lower of the two factors   ability and willingness  and to document the decisions made  Example   is the first of a set that follows the analysis of a private wealth manage  ment client through the preparation of the major elements of an IPS

5,371,The Case of Henri Gascon  Risk Tolerance
6,371,Henri Gascon is an energy trader who works for a major French oil company  based in Paris   He is     years old and married with one son aged    Gascon has  decided that it is time to review his financial situation and consults a financial  adviser  The financial adviser notes the following aspects of Gascon s situation     Gascon s annual salary of         is more than sufficient to cover the  family  s outgoings      Gascon owns his apartment outright and has          of savings      Gascon perceives that his job is reasonably secure     Gascon has a good knowledge of financial matters and is confident that  equity markets will deliver positive returns over the longer term     In the risk tolerance questionnaire Gascon strongly disagrees with the  statements that  making money in stocks and bonds is based on luck  and  that  in terms of investing  safety is more important than returns       Gascon expects that most of his savings will be used to fund his retire  ment  which he hopes to start at age    
1,372,   
2,372,Reading      Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction
3,372,Based only on the information given which of the following statements is most  accurate  A Gascon has a low ability to take risk  but a high willingness to take risk   B Gascon has a high ability to take risk  but a low willingness to take risk   C Gascon has a high ability to take risk  and a high willingness to take risk  
4,372,Solution 
5,372,C is correct   Gascon has a high income relative to outgoings  a high level of  assets  a secure job and a time horizon of    years   This information suggests  a high ability to take risk   At the same time Gascon is knowledgeable and con  fident about financial markets and responds to the questionnaire with answers  that suggest risk tolerance  This result suggests he also has a high willingness  to take risk  
6,372,EXAMPLE  
7,372,The Case of Jacques Gascon  Risk Tolerance
8,372,Henri Gascon is so pleased with the services provided by the financial adviser  that he suggests to his brother Jacques that he should also consult the adviser   Jacques thinks it is a good idea   Jacques is a self  employed computer consultant  also based in Paris   He is     years old and divorced with four children aged  between    and     The financial adviser notes the following aspects of Jacques   situation     Jacques  consultancy earnings average        per annum but are quite  volatile     Jacques is required to pay        per year to his ex  wife and children     Jacques has a mortgage on his apartment of         and        of  savings      Jacques has a good knowledge of financial matters and expects that equity  markets will deliver very high returns over the longer term     In the risk tolerance questionnaire Jacques strongly disagrees with the  statements  I am more comfortable putting my money in a bank account  than in the stock market  and  When I think of the word  risk  the term   loss  comes to mind immediately      Jacques expects that most of his savings will be required to support his  children at university  Based on the above information which statement is correct  A  Jacques has a low ability to take risk  but a high willingness to take risk   B  Jacques has a high ability to take risk  but a low willingness to take risk   C  Jacques has a high ability to take risk  and a high willingness to take risk  
9,372,Solution 
10,372,A is correct   Jacques does not have a particularly high income his income is  unstable and he has reasonably high outgoings for his mortgage and mainte  nance payments   His investment time horizon is approximately two to six years  given the ages of his children and his desire to support them at university  This

5,373,A client s return objectives can be stated in a number of ways   Similar to risk objectives   return objectives may be stated on an absolute or a relative basis   As an example of an absolute objective the client may want to achieve a particular  percentage rate of return for example X percent   This could be a nominal rate of  return or be expressed in real  inflation  adjusted  terms   Alternatively the return objective can be stated on a relative basis  for example  relative to a benchmark return  The benchmark could be an equity market index   such as the S P     or the FTSE     or a cash rate of interest such as Libor  Libor  might be appropriate when the investor has some liability that is linked to that rate   for example a bank that has a particular cost of funding linked to Libor  A relative  return objective might be stated as  for example a desire to outperform the benchmark  index by one percentage point per year  Some institutions also set their return objective relative to a peer group or uni  verse of managers   for example an endowment aiming for a return that is in the top      percent of returns of similar institutions  or a private equity mandate aiming for  returns in the top quartile among the private equity universe  This objective can be  problematic when limited information is known about the investment strategies or  the returns calculation methodology being used by peers  and we must bear in mind  the impossibility of all institutions being  above average   Furthermore a good bench  mark should be investable that is  able to be replicated by the investor and a peer  benchmark typically does not meet that criterion  In each case the return requirement can be stated before or after fees   Care should  be taken that the fee basis used is clear and understood by both the manager and client   The return can also be stated on either a pre  or post  tax basis when the investor is  required to pay tax   For a taxable investor the baseline is to state and analyze returns  on an after  tax basis   The return objective could be a required return that is  the amount the investor  needs to earn to meet a particular future goal such as a certain level of retirement  income  The manager or adviser must ensure that the return objective is realistic  Care  should be taken that client and manager are in agreement on whether the return  objective is nominal  which is more convenient for measurement purposes  or real  i e   inflation  adjusted which usually relates better to the objective   It must be consistent  with the client s risk objective  high expected returns are unlikely to be possible without  high levels of risk  and also with the current economic and market environment   For  example    percent nominal returns might be possible when inflation is    percent   but will be unlikely when inflation is   percent   When a client has unrealistic return expectations  the manager or adviser will  need to counsel them about what is achievable in the current market environment  and within the client s tolerance for risk

4,374,The Case of Henri Gascon  Return Objectives
5,374,Having assessed his risk tolerance Henri Gascon now begins to discuss his  retirement income needs with the financial adviser  He wishes to retire at age     which is    years from now  His salary meets current and expected future  expenditure requirements  but he does not expect to be able to make any  additional pension contributions to his fund  Gascon sets aside         of his  savings as an emergency fund to be held in cash  The remaining         is  invested for his retirement   Gascon estimates that a before  tax amount of          in today  s money  will be sufficient to fund his retirement income needs   The financial adviser  expects inflation to average   percent per year over the next    years   Pension  fund contributions and pension fund returns in France are exempt from tax   but pension fund distributions are taxable upon retirement     Which of the following is closest to the amount of money Gascon will  have to accumulate in nominal terms by his retirement date to meet his  retirement income objective  i e  expressed in money of the day in     years   A          B           C             Which of the following is closest to the annual rate of return that Gascon  must earn on his pension portfolio to meet his retirement income  objective  A       B       C      
6,374,Solution to   
7,374,C is correct   At   percent annual inflation          in today  s money equates  to          in    years measured in money of the day   m               
8,374,Solution to   
9,374,B is correct           growing at      percent per year for    years will accu  mulate to          which is just above the required amount    The solution  of      percent comes from                           X    where X is the  required rate of return  
10,374,In the following sections  we analyze five major types of constraints on portfolio  selection  liquidity time horizon tax concerns  legal and regulatory factors  and  unique circumstances  
11,374,      Liquidity
12,374,The IPS should state what the likely requirements are to withdraw funds from the  portfolio  Examples for an individual investor would be outlays for covering healthcare  payments or tuition fees   For institutions  it could be spending rules and requirements  for endowment funds  the existence of claims coming due in the case of property and  casualty insurance or benefit payments for pension funds and life insurance companies  
1,375,Portfolio Planning
2,375,   
3,375,When the client does have such a requirement the manager should allocate part of  the portfolio to cover the liability  This part of the portfolio will be invested in assets  that are liquid that is  easily converted to cash and low risk at the point in time  the liquidity need is actually present  e g   a bond maturing at the time when private  education expenses will be incurred  so that their value is known with reasonable  certainty  For example the asset allocation in the insurance portfolios of Finnish insurer  Sampo  see Exhibit    shows a large allocation to fixed  income investments  some of  which are either highly liquid or have a short maturity  These investments enable the  company in the case of property and casualty insurance to pay out on potentially   lumpy   claims of which the timing is unpredictable and in the case of life insurance  to pay out on life benefits  the size and timing of which are more predictable and can  therefore be matched with the maturity profile of the fixed  income portfolio

10,376,      Time Horizon
11,376,The IPS should state the time horizon over which the investor is investing   It may  be the period over which the portfolio is accumulating before any assets need to be  withdrawn  it could also be the period until the client s circumstances are likely to  change  For example a     year old pension plan investor hoping to retire at age    has  a     year horizon  The portfolio may not be liquidated at age    but its structure may  need to change for example as the investor begins to draw an income from the fund  The time horizon of the investor will affect the nature of investments used in  the portfolio  Illiquid or risky investments may be unsuitable for an investor with a  short time horizon because the investor may not have enough time to recover from  investment losses  for example  Such investments  however may be suitable for an  investor with a longer horizon especially if the risky investments are expected to  have higher returns  
12,376,EXAMPLE  
13,376,Investment Time Horizon

3,377,A Listed equities   B Private equity  C US Treasury bills  
4,377,Solution to   
5,377,C is correct   With a     year horizon and average risk tolerance Johnson can  accept the additional risk of listed equities and private equity compared with  US Treasury bills  
6,377,Solution to   
7,377,B is correct   Private equity is risky has no public market  and is the least liquid  among the assets mentioned 
8,377,      Tax Concerns
9,377,Tax status varies among investors   Some investors will be subject to taxation on  investment returns and some will not   For example in many countries returns to  pension funds are exempt from tax   Some investors will face various rates of tax on  income  dividends and interest payments  than they do on capital gains  associated  with increases in asset prices   Typically when there is a differential income is taxed  more highly than gains   Gains may be subject to a lower rate of tax or part or all of the  gain may be exempt from taxation  Furthermore income may be taxed as it is earned  whereas gains may be taxed when they are realized  Hence in such cases there is a  time value of money benefit in the deferment of taxation of gains relative to income  In many cases  the portfolio should reflect the tax status of the client   For exam  ple a taxable investor may wish to hold a portfolio that emphasizes capital gains  and receives little income  A taxable investor based in the United States is also likely  to consider including US municipal bonds   munis   in his or her portfolio because  interest income from munis  unlike from treasuries and corporate bonds  is exempt  from taxes   A tax  exempt investor such as a pension fund will be relatively indifferent  to the form of returns  
10,377,      Legal and Regulatory Factors
11,377,The IPS should state any legal and regulatory restrictions that constrain how the  portfolio is invested  In some countries  such institutional investors as pension funds are subject to  restrictions on the composition of the portfolio  For example there may be a limit on  the proportion of equities or other risky assets in the portfolio or on the proportion  of the portfolio that may be invested overseas   The United States has no limits on  pension fund asset allocation but some countries do examples of which are shown in  Exhibit    Pension funds also often face restrictions on the percentage of assets that can  be invested in securities issued by the plan sponsor so called self  investment limits

14,378,When an individual has access to material nonpublic information about a particular  security this situation may also form a constraint  For example the directors of a public  company may need to refrain from trading the company  s stock at certain points of  the year before financial results are published  The IPS should note this constraint so  that the portfolio manager does not inadvertently trade the stock on the client s behalf 
15,378,      Unique Circumstances
16,378,This section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of the client s circumstances  that is likely to have a material impact on the composition of the portfolio  A client  may have considerations derived from his or her religion or ethical values that could  constrain investment choices   For instance a Muslim investor seeking compliance  with Shari a  the Islamic law  will avoid investing in businesses and financial instru  ments inconsistent with Shari a  such as casinos and bonds  because Shari a prohibits  gambling and lending money on interest   Similarly a Christian investor may wish to  avoid investments that he or she believes are inconsistent with their faith  Whether rooted in religious beliefs or not  a client may have personal objections  to certain products  e g   pornography weapons  tobacco gambling  or practices  e g    environmental impact of business activities  human impact of government policies   labour standards  which could lead to the exclusion of certain companies  countries   or types of securities  e g   interest  bearing debt  from the investable universe as well  as the client s benchmark   Such considerations are often referred to as ESG  environ  mental social governance  and investing in accordance with such considerations is  referred to as SRI  socially responsible investing  
17,378,EXAMPLE  
18,378,Ethical Preferences
19,378,The     billion F C Stewardship Growth Fund is designed for investors who  wish to have ethical and environmental principles applied to the selection of  their investments   The fund s managers apply both positive  characteristics to  be emphasized in the portfolio  and negative  characteristics to be avoided in  the portfolio  screening criteria 
20,378,Positive Criteria
21,378,   Supplies the basic necessities of life  e g   healthy food housing  clothing   water energy communication healthcare public transport  safety per  sonal finance education     Offers product choices for ethical and sustainable lifestyles  e g   fair trade  organic     Improves quality of life through the responsible use of new technologies

2,379,   
3,379,   Shows good environmental management    Actively addresses climate change  e g   renewable energy energy  efficiency     Promotes and protects human rights    Supports good employment practices    Provides a positive impact on local communities    Maintains good relations with customers and suppliers    Applies effective anti  corruption controls    Uses transparent communication
4,379,Negative Criteria
5,379,   Tobacco production    Alcohol production    Gambling    Pornography or violent material    Manufacture and sale of weapons    Unnecessary exploitation of animals    Nuclear power generation    Poor environmental practices    Human rights abuses    Poor relations with employees  customers or suppliers
6,379,Source   Excerpted from F C documents   www fandc com new Advisor Default  aspx ID       
7,379,When the portfolio represents only part of the client s total wealth there may  be aspects or portions of wealth not under the control of the manager that have  implications for the portfolio  For example an employee of a public company whose  labour income and retirement income provision are reliant on that company and who  may have substantial investment exposure to the company through employee share  options and stock holdings  may decide that his or her portfolio should not invest  additional amounts in that stock   An entrepreneur may be reluctant to see his or her  portfolio invested in the shares of competing businesses or in any business that has  risk exposures aligned with his or her entrepreneurial venture  A client s income may rely on a particular industry or asset class   Appropriate  diversification requires that industry or asset class to be de  emphasized in the cli  ent s investments   For example a stockbroker should consider having a relatively  low weighting in equities  as his skills and thus income  generating ability are worth  less when equities do not perform well  Employees should similarly be wary of hav  ing concentrated share positions in the equity of the company they work for  If the  employer encounters difficulties  not only may the employee lose his or her job but  their investment portfolio could also suffer a significant loss of value 
8,379,    Gathering Client Information
9,379,As noted above it is important for portfolio managers and investment advisers to  know their clients   For example Dutch securities industry practice requires financial  intermediaries to undertake substantial fact finding   This is required not only in  the case of full service wealth management or in the context of an IPS but also in
1,380,   
2,380,Reading      Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction
3,380, lighter  forms of financial intermediation such as advisory relationships  in which  clients make investment decisions after consultation with their investment adviser  or broker  or execution  only relationships  in which the client makes his investment  decisions independently   An exercise in fact finding about the customer should take place at the beginning  of the client relationship  This will involve gathering information about the client s  circumstances as well as discussing the client s objectives and requirements   Important data to gather from a client should cover family and employment  situation as well as financial information  If the client is an individual it may also be  necessary to know about the situation and requirements of the client s spouse or other  family members   The health of the client and his or her dependents is also relevant  information  In an institutional relationship it will be important to know about key  stakeholders in the organization and what their perspective and requirements are   Information gathering may be done in an informal way or may involve structured  interviews or questionnaires or analysis of data   Many advisers will capture data elec  tronically and use special systems that record data and produce customized reports   Good record keeping is very important  and may be crucial in a case in which any  aspect of the client relationship comes into dispute at a later stage 
4,380,EXAMPLE  
5,380,Henri Gascon  Description of Constraints
6,380,Henri Gascon continues to discuss his investment requirements with the financial  adviser  The financial adviser begins to draft the constraints section of the IPS  Gascon expects that he will continue to work for the oil company and that  his relatively high income will continue for the foreseeable future  Gascon and  his wife do not plan to have any additional children but expect that their son  will go to a university at age     They expect that their son s education costs can  be met out of their salary income  Gascon s emergency reserve of         is considered to be sufficient as a  reserve for unforeseen expenditures and emergencies   His retirement savings of          has been contributed to his defined  contribution pension plan account  to fund his retirement   Under French regulation pension fund contributions  are paid from gross income  i e  income prior to deduction of tax  and pension  fund returns are exempt from tax  but pension payments from a fund to retirees  are taxed as income to the retiree  With respect to Gascon s retirement savings portfolio refer back to Example    as needed and address the following    As concerns liquidity A a maximum of    percent of the portfolio should be invested in liquid  assets   the portfolio should be invested entirely in liquid assets because of  high spending needs   the portfolio has no need for liquidity because there are no short  term  spending requirements     The investment time horizon is closest to  A   years   B    years   C    years     As concerns taxation the portfolio

2,381,   
3,381,A  should emphasize capital gains because income is taxable  B  should emphasize income because capital gains are taxable  C  is tax exempt and thus indifferent between income and capital gains     The principle legal and regulatory factors applying to the portfolio are  A US Securities laws   B European banking laws   C French pension fund regulations     As concerns unique needs  the portfolio should  A have a high weighting in oil and other commodity stocks   B be invested only in responsible and sustainable investments   C not have significant exposure to oil and other commodity stocks  
4,381,Solution to   
5,381,C is correct  The assets are for retirement use which is    years away  Any short   term spending needs will be met from other assets or income 
6,381,Solution to   
7,381,B is correct   The relevant time horizon is to the retirement date which is     years away  The assets may not be liquidated at that point  but a restructuring  of the portfolio is to be expected as Gascon starts to draw an income from it  
8,381,Solution to   
9,381,C is correct   Because no tax is paid in the pension fund it does not matter  whether returns come in the form of income or capital gains  
10,381,Solution to   
11,381,C is correct  The management of the portfolio will have to comply with any rules  relating the French pension funds  
12,381,Solution to   
13,381,C is correct   Gascon s human capital  i e  future labour income  is affected by  the prospects of the oil industry  If his portfolio has significant exposure to oil  stocks  he would be increasing a risk exposure he already has  
14,381,Example    the final one based on Henri Gascon shows how the information  obtained from the fact  finding exercises might be incorporated into the objectives  and constraints section of an IPS 
15,381,EXAMPLE  
16,381,Henri Gascon  Outline of an IPS
17,381,Following is a simplified excerpt from the IPS the adviser prepares for Henri  Gascon covering objectives and constraints  
18,381,Risk Objectives 
19,381,   The portfolio may take on relatively high amounts of risk in seeking to  meet the return requirements   With a     year time horizon and signifi  cant assets and income the client has an above average ability to take risk  
1,382,   
2,382,Reading      Basics of Portfolio Planning and Construction
3,382,The client is a knowledgeable investor with an above average willingness  to take risk   Hence the client s risk tolerance is above average explaining  the above portfolio risk objective     The portfolio should be well diversified with respect to asset classes and  concentration of positions within an asset class   Although the client has  above average risk tolerance his investment assets should be diversified to  control the risk of catastrophic loss  
4,382,Return Objectives 
5,382,The portfolio s long  term return requirement is     percent per year in nominal  terms and net of fees  to meet the client s retirement income goal 
6,382,Constraints 
7,382,   Liquidity  The portfolio consists of pension fund assets and there is no  need for liquidity in the short to medium term     Time Horizon  The portfolio will be invested with a     year time horizon   The client intends to retire in    years  at which time an income will be  drawn from the portfolio     Tax Status  Under French law contributions to the fund are made gross  of tax and returns in the fund are tax  free  Hence the client is indifferent  between income and capital gains in the fund     Legal and Regulatory Factors  The management of the portfolio must  comply with French pension fund regulations      Unique Needs  The client is an executive in the oil industry  The portfolio  should strive to minimize additional exposures to oil and related stocks  
8,382, 
9,382,PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
10,382,Once the IPS has been compiled the investment manager can construct a suitable  portfolio  Strategic asset allocation is a traditional focus of the first steps in portfolio  construction  The strategic asset allocation is stated in terms of percent allocations to  asset classes   An asset class is a category of assets that have similar characteristics   attributes  and risk return relationships   The strategic asset allocation  SAA  is the  set of exposures to IPS   permissible asset classes that is expected to achieve the client s  long  term objectives given the client s investment constraints   The focus on the SAA is the result of a number of important investment princi  ples   One principle is that a portfolio s systematic risk accounts for most of its change  in value over the long term  Systematic risk is risk related to the economic system   e g   risk related to business cycle  that cannot be eliminated by holding a diversified  portfolio  This risk is different from the particular risks of individual securities  which  may be avoided by holding other securities with offsetting risks   A second principle  is that the returns to groups of similar assets  e g   long  term debt claims  predict  ably reflect exposures to certain sets of systematic factors  e g   for the debt claims   unexpected changes in the inflation rate   Thus  the SAA is a means of providing the  investor with exposure to the systematic risks of asset classes in proportions that meet  the risk and return objectives   The process of formulating a strategic asset allocation is based on the IPS already  discussed and capital market expectations  introduced in Section      How to make  the strategic asset allocation operational with a rebalancing policy and a translation
1,383,Portfolio Construction
2,383,   
3,383,into actual investment portfolios will be described in Section      Section     lists  some alternatives to the approach chosen and describes some portfolio construction  techniques  
4,383,    Capital Market Expectations
5,383,Capital market expectations are the investor  s expectations concerning the risk and  return prospects of asset classes  however broadly or narrowly the investor defines  those asset classes   When associated with the client s investment objectives  the result  is the strategic asset allocation that is expected to allow the client to achieve his or  her investment objectives  at least under normal capital market conditions   Traditionally capital market expectations are quantified in terms of asset class  expected returns  standard deviation of returns  and correlations among pairs of asset  classes   Formally the expected return of an asset class consists of the risk  free rate  and one or more risk premium s  associated with the asset class   Expected returns are  in practice developed in a variety of ways  including the use of historical estimates   economic analysis  and various kinds of valuation models   Standard deviations and  correlation estimates are frequently based on historical data  
6,383,    The Strategic Asset Allocation
7,383,Traditionally investors have distinguished cash equities  bonds  and real estate as  the major asset classes   This list has been expanded with private equity hedge funds   and commodities   In addition such assets as art and intellectual property rights may  be considered asset classes for those investors prepared to take a more innovative  approach and to accept some illiquidity  Combining such new asset classes as well  as hedge funds and private equity under the header  alternative investments  has  become accepted practice  As the strategic asset allocation is built up by asset classes  the decision about  how to define those asset classes is an important one  Defining the asset classes also  determines the extent to which the investor controls the risk and return character  istics of the eventual investment portfolio  For example separating bonds into gov  ernment bonds and corporate bonds  and then further separating corporate bonds  into investment grade and non  investment grade  high yield  and government bonds  into domestic and foreign government bonds  creates four bond categories for which  risk return expectations can be expressed and correlations with other asset classes   and in an asset liability management context  with the liabilities  can be estimated   An asset allocator who wants to explicitly consider the risk return characteristics of  those bond categories in the strategic asset allocation may choose to treat them as  distinct asset classes   Similarly in equities some investors distinguish between emerging  market and developed market equities  between domestic and international equities   or between large  cap and small  cap equities   In some regulatory environments for  institutional investors  asset class definitions are mandatory thereby forcing asset  allocators to articulate risk return expectations  and apply risk management  on the  asset classes specified  When defining asset classes  a number of criteria apply  Intuitively an asset class  should contain relatively homogeneous assets while providing diversification relative  to other asset classes   In statistical terms  risk and return expectations should be  similar and paired correlations of assets should be relatively high within an asset class  but should be lower versus assets in other asset classes    Also the asset classes  while
8,383,  A technically precise characterization other than one in terms of pairwise correlations is given by  Kritzman

3,384,EXAMPLE  
4,384,being mutually exclusive should add up to a sufficient approximation of the relevant  investable universe  Applying these criteria ensures that the strategic asset allocation  process has considered all available investment alternatives  
5,384,Specifying Asset Classes
6,384,The strategic asset allocations of many institutional investors make a distinction  between domestic equities and international equities  or between developed  market equities and emerging market equities   Often equities are separated  into different market capitalization brackets  resulting  for example in an asset  class such as domestic small  cap equity  The correlation matrix in Exhibit    shows the paired correlations between  different equity asset classes and other asset classes   These correlations are  measured over    years of monthly returns through February       In addition  the exhibit shows the annualized volatility of monthly returns

3,385,Based only on the information given address the following    Contrast the correlations between equity asset classes with the correla  tions between equity asset classes and European government bonds     Which equity asset class is most sharply distinguished from MSCI  Europe 
4,385,Solution to   
5,385,The matrix reveals very strong correlation between the equity asset classes  MSCI  Europe MSCI Emerging Markets  MSCI EAFE  and MSCI US   For example the  correlation between European equities and US equities is       The correlation  of equities with bonds  however is much lower  For example both asset classes  have a similar negative correlation with European government bonds         and       respectively   It is worth noting  however that correlations can vary  through time and the values shown may be specific to the sample period used   In this particular case extreme market conditions in      resulted in negative  correlations between equities and bonds  
6,385,Solution to   
7,385,Correlations of emerging market equities with other categories of equities are       or higher whereas all groupings of equities share similar correlations with  commodities  between      and       gold  between       and       and real  estate  between      and        These high  paired correlations between equity  asset classes  combined with the similarity of the correlations between any of  these asset classes and non  equity asset classes  suggests that defining the equity  asset class more narrowly has limited added value in providing diversification   The case for treatment as a separate asset class can best be made for emerging  markets stocks  which usually have the lowest correlation of all equity asset  classes with other asset classes and have a volatility of returns far in excess of  the other equity groupings  
8,385,Using correlation as a metric Example    tends to indicate that only emerging  markets were well differentiated from European equities   So why do investors still  often subdivide equities  Apart from any regulatory reasons  one explanation might  be that this decomposition into smaller asset classes corresponds to the way the asset  allocation is structured in portfolios   Many investment managers have expertise exclu  sively in specific areas of the market  such as emerging market equities  US small  cap  equity or international investment  grade credit  Bringing the asset class definitions of  the asset allocation in line with investment products actually available in the market  may simplify matters from an organizational perspective  The risk return profile of the strategic asset allocation depends on the expected  returns and risks of the individual asset classes  as well as the correlation between  those asset classes   In general adding assets classes with low correlation improves  the risk return trade  off  more return for similar risk  as long as the stand  alone risk  of such asset classes does not exceed its diversification effect   Typically the strategic  asset allocation for risk  averse investors will have a large weight in government bonds  and cash whereas those with more willingness and ability to take risk will have more  of their assets in risky asset classes  such as equities and many types of alternative  investments

20,386,  Discuss the way the asset classes have been defined    How does the asset allocation relate to the pension fund s ambition to pay  out a real  i e  inflation  adjusted  pension 
21,386,  ABP defines an asset class category called  real assets   which contains asset classes  not fixed  income  securities  that are expected to perform well in times of inflation but considered a major risk   The use of  the term  real assets  differs from the use elsewhere in the CFA curriculum  The term  innovation  refers  to alternative investments that are relatively new to ABP s portfolio  An example of such an investment  is music rights    Infrastructure  is investments in non  public equity of infrastructure projects such as  toll roads   Inflation  linked bonds are fixed  income securities of which the payout depends on a measure  of inflation in the issuing country  Some major issuers of such bonds are the United States  the United  Kingdom and France

2,387,Portfolio Construction
3,387,Solution to   
4,387,The asset allocation is fairly narrow in its definition of alternative asset classes   whereas the traditional asset classes  such as bonds and equities  are defined  quite broadly  It appears that allocations within the broader groupings of gov  ernment bonds  credits  and equities  developed and emerging  are not made  on the strategic level 
5,387,Solution to   
6,387,This asset allocation seems to reflect an attempt to control the risk of inflation   only     percent of the strategic asset allocation is in nominal bonds  whereas     percent is in inflation  linked bonds and     percent in  real  assets  assets  believed to have a positive correlation with inflation and therefore hedging  inflation to some degree  
7,387,A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objec  tives articulated in the IPS and long  term capital market expectations regarding the  asset classes   The strategic asset allocation or policy portfolio will subsequently be  implemented into real portfolios   Exhibit    illustrates conceptually how investment  objectives and constraints and long  term capital market expectations combine into  a policy portfolio

14,387,In some frameworks used in practice the asset allocation is an integral part of the  investment policy statement   This presentation however keeps the asset allocation  separate from the investment policy statement because clients  investment objectives  and constraints qualitatively differ in nature from capital market expectations  thus  requiring different types of analysis  different sources of information and different  review cycles   How will capital market expectations and investment objectives and constraints  eventually translate into a strategic asset allocation  In general investors choosing  from a range of asset allocations with similar returns would prefer those with lower  risk   Choosing from allocations with similar levels of risk  investors would prefer  those with the highest return  Formally investors  risk and return objectives can be  described as a utility function in which utility increases with higher expected returns

3,389,Both the efficient frontier and a range of indifference curves can be plotted in the  risk return space  In Exhibit    the downward curves that are concave from below  represent efficient frontiers associated with different assumed expected returns   The  upward or convex curves are indifference curves   The point where the efficient fron  tier intersects with the indifference curve with the highest utility attainable  i e  the  point of tangency  represents the optimal asset allocation for the client investor  In  Exhibit   efficient frontier   has a point of tangency with indifference curve    Higher  levels of utility such as those associated with indifference curve   can apparently  not be reached with the assets underlying the efficient frontier  It is clear that when  capital market expectations change this change moves the efficient frontier away from  its original location  In the chart  this movement is illustrated by efficient frontier    which incorporates different capital market expectations   This new efficient frontier  has a point of tangency with indifference curve   which is associated with a lower  level of expected utility  Because the point of tangency represents the strategic asset  allocation it implies the asset allocation should be adjusted  Similarly should invest  ment objectives or constraints change the indifference curves will change their shape  and location  This change will again move the point of tangency and hence change  the asset allocation

37,391,    Steps Toward an Actual Portfolio
38,391,The strategic asset allocation in itself does not yet represent an actual investment  portfolio  It is the first step in implementing an investment strategy  For quantitatively  oriented portfolio managers  the next step is often risk budgeting   As used in this reading  risk budgeting is the process of deciding on the amount  of risk to assume in a portfolio  the overall risk budget  and subdividing that risk  over the sources of investment return  e g   strategic asset allocation tactical asset  allocation and security selection    Because the decision about the amount of risk  to be taken is made in constructing the IPS at this stage we are concerned about the  subdivision of that risk   Apart from the exposures to systematic risk factors specified in the strategic asset  allocation the returns of an investment strategy depend on two other sources   tac  tical asset allocation and security selection  Tactical asset allocation is the decision  to deliberately deviate from the policy exposures to systematic risk factors  i e  the  policy weights of asset classes  with the intent to add value based on forecasts of
39,391,  Some writers use risk budgeting to refer to allocating an amount or budget of tracking risk to active  portfolio managers on a given asset class   See Waring  Whitney Pirone Castille

3,392,the near  term returns of those asset classes   For instance an investor may decide to  temporarily invest more of the portfolio in equities than the SAA prescribes if the  investor anticipates that equities will deliver a higher return over the short term than  other asset classes   Security selection is an attempt to generate higher returns than  the asset class benchmark by selecting securities with a higher expected return  For  example an investment manager may decide to add more IBM stock in his portfolio  than the weight in his equity benchmark if he expects this stock to do better than the  benchmark   To fund this purchase he may sell another stock expected to do worse  than either the benchmark or IBM  Obviously deciding to deviate from policy weights  or to select securities aiming to beat the benchmark creates additional uncertainty  about returns   This risk is over and above the risk inherent in the policy portfolio   Hence an investment policy should set risk limits and desired payoffs for each of  these three activities   Risk budgeting implies that the portfolio manager has to choose for every asset  class  whether to deploy security selection as a return generator  This choice is generally  referred to as the choice between active or passive management   Contrary to strategic  asset allocation where exposures to sources of systematic risk are selected and sized  security selection is not rewarded with a long  run payoff to risk   Security selection is  a zero  sum game  All investors in an asset class are competing with each to identify a  typically limited number of assets that are misvalued  In total the gross returns of all  market participants average out to the market return  the reward for taking systematic  risk   This implies that the average active investor will match the market return and  that one investor  s gain versus the market return is the other investor  s loss versus the  market return  However because active managers tend to trade more and have to pay  people  including themselves  to generate investment ideas or information leading to  such ideas  the average active manager will underperform the market  net of costs    This does not imply however that there are no skillful investment managers who  with some consistency beat their benchmarks   Neither does it imply that all passive  managers will be able to match the benchmark   The higher the turnover of an index   the more trading costs a passive manager will incur making the task of effectively  mimicking an index more difficult   The likelihood of adding a significant amount of value from security selection  depends on the skills of the manager and the informational efficiency of the market  for the asset class his skill relates to  The more efficient an asset class or a subset of  that asset class  such as a regional stock  bond or real estate market or a size category  within the stock market  the more skillful an asset manager has to be to add value   Broadly speaking  an efficient market is a market in which prices  on average very  quickly reflect newly available information  That requires a sizeable participation of  mean variance optimizing investors  acting on rational expectations  using the same or  similar pricing models  and having equal opportunities to access relevant information   Clearly the market for US large  capitalization equities would be quite efficient   By  contrast some regional bond and equity markets do not have the technical and regula  tory systems for information dissemination that are sufficient to serve all investors on  a timely basis   Skilled managers should be able to exploit the resulting inefficiencies   Sometimes  however the choice between active and passive management is actually  made implicitly when the asset class is included in the asset allocation  The markets for  some assets such as those for non  listed real estate art  and infrastructure assets  are so illiquid that it is very difficult to buy a diversified exposure  As a result  there  is no way of taking exposure to the asset class without engaging in security selection  As the portfolio is constructed and its value changes with the returns of the asset  classes and securities in which it is invested the weights of the asset classes will grad  ually deviate from the policy weights in the strategic asset allocation  This process is  referred to as drift   Periodically or when a certain threshold deviation from the policy  weight  the bandwidth  has been breached the portfolio should be rebalanced back to

23,394,The prior decision not to rebalance to policy weights did not have a positive  result  Contrary to the expectations of the investment committee both European  and international equities performed poorly while bonds recovered  The return  of the portfolio was      percent     How much of this return can be attributed to tactical asset allocation 
24,394,Solution to   
25,394,Because tactical asset allocation is the deliberate decision to deviate from policy  weights  the return contribution from tactical asset allocation is equal to the  difference between the actual return and the return that would have been made  if the asset class weights were equal to the policy weights   Exhibit    shows the  difference to be       percent

17,395,The process of executing an investment strategy continues with selecting the appro  priate manager s  for each asset class and allocating funds to them  The investment  portfolio management process is then well into the execution stage  The investment managers  performance will be monitored as well as the results of  the strategic asset allocation  When asset class weights move outside their corridors   money is transferred from the asset classes that have become too large compared with  the SAA to those that fall short   Managers as well as the strategic asset allocation will  be reviewed on the basis of the outcome of the monitoring process   In addition cap  ital market expectations may change as may the circumstances and objectives of the  client   These changes could result in an adjustment of the strategic asset allocation 
18,395,    Additional Portfolio Organizing Principles
19,395,The top  down oriented framework laid out in earlier paragraphs is quite general  Other  models of portfolio organization are also used in practice and these are described  briefly here  In addition this section introduces some portfolio construction concepts  in use to better capture the value of active management   According to some practitioners  a top  down investment process as described  earlier has two drawbacks   They both result from the fact that in a top  down process   a multitude of specialist managers may work for the same client within the same  asset class   Each of these managers will manage risk versus the client s benchmark   and because these benchmarks may be similar to or overlapping with those of other  managers  the aggregate of all the portfolios within one asset class may be less active  than was intended  The resulting investment portfolio may underutilize its risk budget   Another drawback is that as the investment managers each engage in trading over the  full extent  including the benchmark exposure  of their portfolio the aggregate of all  portfolios may not be efficient from a capital gains tax point of view  More trading  results in more capital gains being realized increasing the tax bill at the end of the  year  To circumvent these issues  the core satellite approach was developed  In this  approach a majority of the portfolio is invested on a passive or low active risk basis   usually a combination of a bond portfolio and an equity portfolio  while a minority  of the assets is managed aggressively in smaller  satellite  portfolios   The aim of the  satellite portfolios is to generate a high active return with little regard for benchmark  exposure whereas the core is managed with low turnover to capture the long  term  systematic risk premium of its assets on a tax  optimal basis   The aggressive manage  ment in satellites can be executed with the objective of market timing  in which case  tactical asset tilts are executed through long short positions in asset class indexes or  derivatives  as well as security selection  in which case highly active security selection  vehicles act as satellites   A drawback of the core satellite approach is that the assign  ment of asset class monies to actual portfolio managers with their various expected

4,396,SUMMARY
5,396,In this reading  we have discussed construction of a client s investment policy state  ment  including discussion of risk and return objectives and the various constraints  that will apply to the portfolio  We have also discussed the portfolio construction  process  with emphasis on the strategic asset allocation decisions that must be made     The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process   Without a  full understanding of the client s situation and requirements  it is unlikely that  successful results will be achieved     The IPS can take a variety of forms   A typical format will include the client s  investment objectives and also list the constraints that apply to the client s  portfolio     The client s objectives are specified in terms of risk tolerance and return  requirements      The constraints section covers factors that need to be considered when con  structing a portfolio for the client that meets the objectives   The typical con  straint categories are liquidity requirements  time horizon regulatory require  ments  tax status  and unique needs      Risk objectives are specifications for portfolio risk that reflect the risk tolerance  of the client   Quantitative risk objectives can be absolute or relative or a combi  nation of the two     The client s overall risk tolerance is a function of the client s ability to accept  risk and their  risk attitude  which can be considered the client s willingness to  take risk      The client s return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis   As  an example of an absolute objective the client may want to achieve a particular  percentage rate of return  Alternatively the return objective can be stated on a  relative basis  for example relative to a benchmark return     The liquidity section of the IPS should state what the client s requirements are  to draw cash from the portfolio     The time horizon section of the IPS should state the time horizon over which  the investor is investing   This horizon may be the period during which the port  folio is accumulating before any assets need to be withdrawn     Tax status varies among investors and a client s tax status should be stated in  the IPS     The IPS should state any legal or regulatory restrictions that constrain the  investment of the portfolio     The unique circumstances section of the IPS should cover any other aspect of  a client s circumstances that is likely to have a material impact on the composi  tion of the portfolio  for example any religious or ethical preferences      Asset classes are the building blocks of an asset allocation  An asset class is a  category of assets that have similar characteristics  attributes  and risk return  relationships   Traditionally investors have distinguished cash equities  bonds   and real estate as the major asset classes

3,397,   A strategic asset allocation results from combining the constraints and objec  tives articulated in the IPS and capital market expectations regarding the asset  classes      As time goes on a client s asset allocation will drift from the target allocation  and the amount of allowable drift as well as a rebalancing policy should be  formalized     In addition to taking systematic risk  an investment committee may choose  to take tactical asset allocation risk or security selection risk   The amount of  return attributable to these decisions can be measured

4,402,  C is correct   Depending on circumstances  a written IPS or its equivalent may  be required by law or regulation and a written IPS is certainly consistent with  best practices   The mere fact that a written IPS is prepared for a client  however  does not ensure that risk and return objectives will in fact be achieved    A is correct   A written IPS is best seen as a communication instrument allowing  clients and portfolio managers to mutually establish investment objectives and  constraints     B is correct   A written IPS to be successful must incorporate a full understand  ing of the client s situation and requirements   As stated in the reading   The IPS  will be developed following a fact finding discussion with the client      B is correct   The major components of an IPS are listed in Section     of the  reading   Investment Guidelines are described as the section that provides infor  mation about how policy may be executed including investment constraints    Statement of Duties and Responsibilities  detail s  the duties and responsibilities  of the client  the custodian of the client s assets  the investment managers  and  so forth   Investment Objectives is  a section explaining the client s objectives in  investing      C is correct   The major components of an IPS are listed in Section     of the  reading   Strategic Asset Allocation  also known as the policy portfolio  and  Rebalancing Policy are often included as appendices to the IPS  The Statement  of Duties and Responsibilities however is an integral part of the IPS and is  unlikely to be placed in an appendix     B is correct   According to the reading   The sections of an IPS that are most  closely linked to the client s distinctive needs are those dealing with invest  ment objectives and constraints    Investment Guidelines   provide  informa  tion about how policy may be executed including investment constraints     Procedures   detail  the steps to be taken to keep the IPS current and the  procedures to follow to respond to various contingencies    Statement of Duties  and Responsibilities  detail s  the duties and responsibilities of the client  the  custodian of the client s assets  the investment managers  and so forth     A is correct   Because the return objective specifies a target return relative to the  FTSE     Index  the objective is best described as a relative return objective    C is correct   Risk attitude is a subjective factor and measuring risk attitude is  difficult   Oftentimes  investment managers use psychometric questionnaires   such as those developed by Grable and Joo        to assess a client s willingness  to take risk     B is correct   The reference to the DAX marks this response as a relative risk  objective  Value at risk establishes a minimum value of loss expected during a  specified time period at a given level of probability  A statement of maximum  allowed absolute loss       million  is an absolute risk objective     C is correct   Measuring willingness to take risk  risk tolerance risk aversion   is an exercise in applied psychology  Instruments attempting to measure risk  attitudes exist  but they are clearly less objective than measurements of ability  to take risk   Ability to take risk is based on relatively objective traits such as  expected income time horizon and existing wealth relative to liabilities

12,404,Risk and risk management is an inescapable part of economic activity  People gen  erally manage their affairs in order to be as happy and secure as their environment and  resources will allow  But regardless of how carefully these affairs are managed there is  risk because the outcome whether good or bad is seldom predictable with complete  certainty  There is risk inherent in nearly everything we do but this reading will focus  on economic and financial risk  particularly as it relates to investment management   All businesses and investors manage risk  whether consciously or not  in the  choices they make  At its core business and investing are about allocating resources  and capital to chosen risks   In their decision process  within an environment of  uncertainty these entities may take steps to avoid some risks  pursue the risks that  provide the highest rewards  and measure and mitigate their exposure to these risks as  necessary  Risk management processes and tools make difficult business and financial  problems easier to address in an uncertain world  Risk is not just a matter of fate  it is

4,406,The answers to these questions collectively help to define the process of risk manage  ment   This reading is organized along the lines of these questions   Section   describes  the risk management process  and Section   discusses risk governance and risk toler  ance  Section   covers the identification of various risks  and Section   addresses the  measurement and management of risks   Section   provides a summary 
5,406,THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
6,406,Risk broadly speaking  is exposure to uncertainty  Risk is also the concept used to  describe all of the uncertain environmental variables that lead to variation in and  unpredictability of outcomes   More colloquially risk is about the chance of a loss or  adverse outcome as a result of an action inaction or external event   This last view may make it sound as if risk is something to be avoided  But that  is not at all the case  Risk is a key ingredient in the recipe for business or investment  success  and return without risk is generally a false hope and usually a prescription  for falling short of one s goals   Risks taken must be carefully chosen understood and  well  managed to have a chance at adding value through decisions   Risk and return  are the interconnected forces of the financial universe  Many decision makers focus  on return which is not something that is easily controlled as opposed to risk  or  exposure to risk  which may actually be managed or controlled  Risk exposure is the extent to which the underlying environmental or market  risks result in actual risk borne by a business or investor who has assets or liabilities  that are sensitive to those risks   It is the state of being exposed or vulnerable to a  risk   Risk exposure results from the decisions of an organization or investor to take  on risk  sensitive assets and liabilities   Suppose there is an important announcement in Japan that will result in the yen  either appreciating or depreciating by     The range of possible outcomes in real sit  uations is clearly not as simple as the up  or  down    case used here but we will use  a simplified example to make an important point   The risk is the uncertain outcome  of this event  and the currency risk to a non  Japanese business is the uncertain return  or variation in return in domestic currency terms that results from the event   The risk  can be described as the range of resulting outcomes and is often thought of in terms  of a probability distribution of future returns   Suppose that the underlying amount is            The risk exposure of a business may be zero or it could be sizable depend  ing on whether the business has assets or liabilities tied to this risk  in this case  exposure to that currency  One million yen would in this example result in         of risk exposure     of            Risk management would include among other  things  quantifying and understanding this risk exposure deciding how and why to  have the exposure and how much risk the participant can bear and possibly mitigating  this risk by tailoring the exposure in a number of ways   The risk management process  would inform the decision of whether to operate or invest in this risky currency 
7,406,  The word  risk  is confusing because it is used by different people at different times to mean so many  different things   Even when used properly the term has three related but different meanings  which this  example illustrates well  Risk can mean in turn the underlying uncertainty the extent of the risky action  taken or the resulting range of risky outcomes to the entity  In this example the first meaning is the  uncertain     or     movement of the currency  The second meaning is the          worth of risky  currency the position taken by the business   The third meaning is the         or         risky outcome  that might accrue to the business for having engaged in this risky activity  A common way of more precisely  distinguishing among these three  risks  in usage is   risk driver for the underlying risk  risk position to  describe or quantify the risky action taken and risk exposure for the potential valuation change that may  result   In the oversimplified example above the risk exposure is simply the risk position multiplied by the  risk driver  In practice the term  risk  is used interchangeably for all three meanings

3,407,Risk management is the process by which an organization or individual  defines the level of risk to be taken measures the level of risk being taken  and adjusts the latter toward the former with the goal of maximizing the  company s or portfolio s value or the individual s overall satisfaction or utility  Said differently risk management comprises all the decisions and actions needed  to best achieve organizational or personal objectives while bearing a tolerable level  of risk   Risk management is not about minimizing risk   it is about actively under  standing and embracing those risks that best balance the achievement of goals with  an acceptable chance of failure quantifying the exposure and continually monitoring  and modifying it   A company that shied away from all risk would find that it could  not operate  In trying to create wealth all entities will find themselves  in the risk  business    Risk management is not about avoiding risks any more than a practical  diet is about avoiding calories   Risk management is not even about predicting risks     The Doctrine of No Surprises  is a key mantra among many risk managers  but it  does not mean they are expected to predict what will happen  Instead it means that  if an unpredictable event  either positive or negative happens in an uncertain world  the impact of that event on the organization or portfolio would not be a surprise and  would have been quantified and considered in advance  For example a risk manager of a bank would not have been expected to know that  a real estate crisis was going to occur and cause significant defaults on the bank s real  estate securities   But a good risk manager would help the bank s management decide  how much exposure it should have in these securities by quantifying the potential  financial impact of such a crisis destroying  say     of the bank s capital  A good risk  management process would include a deep discussion at the governance level about  the balance between the likely returns and the unlikely but sizable losses and  whether such losses are tolerable  Management would ensure that the risk analysis  and discussion actively affects their investment decisions  that the potential loss is  continuously quantified and communicated and that it will take actions to mitigate or  transfer any portion of the risk exposure that cannot be tolerated   The only surprise  here should be the market shock itself   the risk manager should have prepared the  organization through stress  testing and scenario analysis  continuously reporting in  advance on the potential impact of this sizable risk exposure  A poor risk management process would have ignored the possibility though small  of such a significant market event and not quantified the potential loss from exposure  to a real estate crisis   As such the bank s management would have had no idea that  more than half of the bank s capital could be at risk  not addressed this risk in any  governance risk appetite discussion ignored these risks in its investment decisions   and not taken any action to mitigate this risk   In a good risk management process   most of the work is done before an adverse event happens   in a poor risk management  process  perhaps just as much work gets done but it all comes after the event  which  is after the damage has been done  Good risk management does not prevent losses  but provides a full top  to  bottom  framework that rigorously informs the decision  making process before during   and after a risk event   Because risks and exposures are dynamic risk management  is a continuous process that is always being reevaluated and revised  If this process  is done well it provides management and staff with the knowledge to navigate as  efficiently as possible toward the goals set by the governing body  In turn this effort  increases ex ante the value of the business or investment decisions undertaken  Good  risk management may allow managers to more quickly or effectively act in the face

3,409,The power of technology has allowed for risk management to be more quantita  tive and timely  Management can measure and monitor risk  run scenarios  conduct  statistical analysis  work with more complex models  and examine more dimensions  and risk drivers as well as do it faster  This use of technology needs to be balanced  with and supplement not supplant experienced business judgment   Technology  has made risk infrastructure even more important and beneficial in managing risks   Risk infrastructure refers to the people and systems required to track risk expo  sures and perform most of the quantitative risk analysis to allow an assessment of the  organization s risk profile  Infrastructure would include risk capture  the important  operational process by which a risk exposure gets populated into a risk system  a  database and data model analytic models and systems  a stress or scenario engine  and an ability to generate reports  as well as some amount of skilled and empowered  personnel resources dedicated to building and executing the risk framework   With  increased reliance on technology more time and effort must be allotted to test data   models  and results in order to avoid the ironic outcome of the risk of errors coming  from within risk systems   Obviously the scope of risk infrastructure will be related to the resources  or  potential losses  of the organization  Individuals and smaller businesses may rely heavily  on an external partner or provider for much of their risk infrastructure and analysis   Policies and processes are the extension of risk governance into both the day  to  day  operation and decision  making processes of the organization  There may be limits   requirements  constraints  and guidelines some quantitative some procedural to  ensure risky activities are in line with the organization s predetermined risk tolerance  and regulatory requirements   Much of this is just common sense business practice   updating and protecting data  controlling cash flows  conducting due diligence on  investments  handling exceptions and escalations  and making checklists to support  important decisions   In a good risk framework  processes would naturally evolve to  consider risk at all key decision points  such as investment decisions and asset allo  cation  Risk management should become an integrated part of the business and not  just a policing or regulatory function  The process of risk monitoring mitigation and management is the most obvious  facet of a risk framework  but also one of the most difficult   Actively monitoring  and managing risk requires pulling together risk governance identification and  measurement  infrastructure and policies and processes and continually reviewing  and reevaluating in the face of changing risk exposures and risk drivers   It requires  recognizing when risk exposure is not aligned with risk tolerance and then taking  action to bring them back into alignment    Communication of critical risk issues must happen continually and across all levels  of the organization  Governance parameters  such as risk tolerances and associated  constraints  must be clearly communicated to and understood by managers   Risk  metrics must be reported in a clear and timely manner  Risk issues must be reviewed  and discussed as a standard part of decision making   Changes in exposure must be  discussed so that action can be taken as appropriate  There should also be a feedback  loop with the governance body so that top  level risk guidance can be validated or  updated and communicated back to the rest of the organization  Strategic analysis and integration help turn risk management into an offensive  weapon to improve performance  Good risk management is a key to increasing the  value of the overall business or portfolio  A risk management framework should pro  vide the tools to better understand the how and why of performance and help sort out  which activities are adding value and which are not  In investing  rigorous analysis can  support better investment decisions and improve strategy and risk  adjusted returns

37,410,Exhibit   illustrates the process of risk management for an enterprise pulling all  the described elements of the risk framework together  Although there are a very high  number of risks faced by every organization most organizations are primarily affected  by a small number of key risk drivers  or primary underlying factors that create risk    Along the left side is risk governance which represents board  level decisions and  encompasses and affects the boxes immediately to its right   The governance body  often called a board defines the goals of the organization and in turn decides on  its risk tolerance  It may additionally provide guidance on how or where that risk is  taken  risk budgeting   The board is also involved in setting high  level policies that  will affect most risk management processes   These risk governance activities are a  crucial keystone of the risk framework and will be discussed in detail in the next  section  When the rest of the risk framework hinges off of these top  down governance  elements and is focused on the goals of the entire enterprise  as shown here  the end  result is effective enterprise risk management   The role of management shown in the middle column is to plan and execute value   maximizing strategies consistent with their governance guidance  Each management  activity in the framework flows not only from management  shown with the arrows   but also from the governance activities on the left   Thus  not only are management s  strategies designed to achieve the board s goals  but management also allocates capital  to risky activities  its business or investing choices  to execute its strategies consistent  with the defined risk tolerance  The risk exposures that result from management s  choice of activities should also be aligned with the governing body  s risk budget   In

2,411,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,411,addition management participates actively in setting or implementing policies and  establishing procedures that relate to when how how much and by whom each of  the other elements of the risk framework are performed   The rest of the risk management framework comprises a number of important  risk activities to help the business achieve all of its strategic and governance goals  and mandates   These other elements to implement risk management are shown in  the far right column of the illustration  Driven by its need to establish a risk man  agement program to support the enterprise s goals  management would provide the  requisite resources for risk management activities by establishing a risk management  infrastructure  With risk processes defined and risk infrastructure in place risks are  then identified and measured which is a regular and continual process of translat  ing risk exposures  produced by the risky activities  into meaningful and generally  quantitative risk metrics   The next major steps risk monitoring  mitigation and management are where  much of a firm s day  to  day risk management activity is focused  These activities are split  across three boxes in the illustration  Risk levels are continuously monitored having  just been measured   There is a major decision at the monitoring stage  Management  must check that all the risks are in line and not outside the limits of the defined risk  tolerance or budget    This process involves evaluating the actual risk exposures com  pared with the organization s risk policies and procedures to ensure that everything  is in compliance  If the answer is  no  then risk mitigation and management actions  need to be taken to modify risk levels and to bring them back into compliance  There  are a variety of methods to accomplish this task  which are addressed in Section     Whatever the method management s allocation of the risk budget to risky activities  will be altered by this modification which includes changing the entity  s risk expo  sures  starting the circle again through the steps on the right  and re  checking to see  if risk levels are now consistent with risk policies   When risks are in line with limits  policies  tolerances  mandates  and so on then the  process moves back to continuous monitoring followed by communicating risk levels     This communication at a minimum includes reporting key risk metrics on a regular  and timely basis across the organization to assist management in its decision  making  process and the board in fulfilling its governance duties   Finally strategic analysis is  supported by the risk measurement  reporting  and other steps of the enterprise risk  management process   By analyzing all of the enterprise s strategies and risky activities  via the risk measurement lens  management can improve its decision  making process  and ascertain where to invest its limited capital and risk budget most fruitfully  This  step is generally underappreciated and is an inexpensive and beneficial by  product  of having built a risk framework   The last two boxes or steps  reports and strategic  analysis  represent important feedback loops to inform and improve both governance  and the portfolio of risky activities that make up the business  
4,411,  In essence there could be an arrow from policies and processes to every other box to the right  but  these rather obvious relationships are intentionally omitted in the diagram to avoid clutter  Likewise risk  exposures inform nearly all the boxes to the right   Risk management is innately quite interrelated    Continuous usually does not mean real  time  the frequency of monitoring is based on the resources avail  able the level of systems support and the need for risk information in the decision process   At large financial  firms  this monitoring will generally be daily   for small businesses and individuals it might be quarterly    This task is generally delegated to a risk manager   but whatever the title someone must be accountable  for this important check     While not obvious in the illustration communication and reporting should happen whether or not  risk levels are in compliance  such communications are even more important when risk levels are out of  alignment with tolerances  
1,412,The Risk Management Process
2,412,   
3,412,There are many feedback loops in properly executed risk management  In practice  most of these steps overlap most of the time and are being performed simultaneously   Good risk management ties together all these steps from the highest governance  decisions to lower  level specifics  such as models  reports  and operational checklists   The risk environment is dynamic and many of our notions of probabilities and  likely risk outcomes change in ways we probably could not predict   The risk manage  ment framework should be robust enough to anticipate this dynamism to expect  the unexpected  It should be evolutionary flexible enough to grow with a company  or individual and its new challenges   The complexity of the risk management framework depends on the complexity  of an entity  s risk exposures and their resources   But that does not mean that smaller  organizations or individuals should skip the risk management process  they may simply  be able to do less  or have to work with external partners to assist with large portions  of the framework  or be less formal about the process   Ultimately the key principles  just covered are still important even to the smallest entity even if the specific com  ponents do not get assembled as described 
4,412,THE R ISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS FOR AN IND IV IDUAL
5,412,Although an individual has neither the resources nor the organizational overhead of  a large business the impor tance of risk management is not diminished and the risk  management framework still applies albeit most likely in a scaled  down form  Though  nearly all of the essential elements of the process illustrated in Exhibit   are still useful  the individual can reduce the recipe to six essential ingredients consistent with the  reduced scope of the individual s risk exposures  The first step for an individual is much like that shown in Exhibit   for the most complex  organization  the determination of goals or objectives  This step would include most of the  elements associated with risk governance just without all the organizational complexity  The nex t functional step involves choosing investments  or other assets  and identi  fying their risks  Lacking any risk infrastructure the individual may at this stage already  require the services of an investment professional or financial adviser  This step and  subsequent steps will probably be executed by the adviser although the individual  principal still needs to stay knowledgeable and involved  In the contex t of the illustra  tion in Exhibit   the individual is effectively their own governance body and the adviser  serves the role of management  The nex t steps for the individual are equivalent to the hear t of the risk management  process  risk monitoring and risk mitigation and management  The individual would  first evaluate their risk exposure  like the diamond or decision step in the illustration   then consider various alternative approaches to modify the risk if necessary followed by  implementing the risk management solution  insuring hedging trading etc    The final functional step for an individual s risk management process would be evalu  ation and review  This step is parallel to the back  end of the risk management illustration  the boxes at the bottom right  This process may occur with much less frequency for an  individual but it is no less impor tant  Each individual should simplify the risk management process as required so that they  do not end up considering it  too esoteric and complicated to worry about   and thus  ignoring risk management altogether  The potential costs of avoiding risk management  are essentially the same for an individual as for a large corporation or a hedge fund  although perhaps with less money involved 
6,412,At its core business and investing are about allocating resources and capital to  chosen risks   Understanding which risks drive better outcomes should be one of the  goals of risk management  and it makes good risk management inextricably linked  with good management generally  When effective risk management is truly integrated  at all levels of the decision  making process and the overall management process 
1,413,   
2,413,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,413,the organization has developed an effective risk culture  This culture generally pro  duces better results than just considering risk issues as a separate afterthought  and  in turn it produces much better results than ignoring risk issues altogether in the  decision  making process   For individuals  the adoption of a risk culture should result  in a personal awareness of the many types of risks  their rewards  the costs  the rela  tionships between them and the methods of aligning the risks borne with the risks  and outcomes desired  This awareness should lead to better investment return and  or smaller losses for the risk taken resulting in higher satisfaction  There are a number of other benefits from establishing good risk management        Most obvious is less frequent surprises and a better notion of what the damage  would be in the event of a surprise      more decision discipline leading to better con  sideration of trade  offs and better risk return relationships       better response and  risk mitigation stemming from more awareness and active monitoring  which should  trim some of the worst losses       better efficiency and fewer operational errors from  policies and procedures  transparency and risk awareness       better relations  with  more trust  between the governing body and management  which generally results  in more effective delegation      a better image or reputation because analysts and  investors perceive a company as prudent and value  focused  Together all these benefits  should lead to higher value for the enterprise 
4,413,EXAMPLE  
5,413,Risk Management and Risk Management Framework
6,413,  Which of the following is not a goal of risk management  A Measuring risk exposures B Minimizing exposure to risk C Defining the level of risk appetite   Which element of a risk management framework sets the overall context  for risk management in an organization  A Governance B Risk infrastructure C Policies and processes   Which element of risk management makes up the analytical component of  the process  A Communication B Risk governance C Risk identification and measurement   Which element of risk management involves action when risk exposures  are found to be out of line with risk tolerance  A Risk governance B Risk identification and measurement C Risk monitoring  mitigation and management
7,413,Solution to   
8,413,B is correct   The definition of risk management includes both defining the level  of risk desired and measuring the level of risk taken  Risk management means  taking risks actively and in the best  most value  added way possible and is not  about minimizing risks  
1,414,   
2,414, 
3,414,Risk Governance
4,414,Solution to   
5,414,A is correct   Governance is the element of the risk management framework that  is the top  level foundation for risk management   Although policies  procedures   and infrastructure are necessary to implement a risk management framework   it is governance that provides the overall context for an organization s risk  management  
6,414,Solution to   
7,414,C is correct   Risk identification and measurement is the quantitative part of  the process   It involves identifying the risks and summarizing their potential  quantitative impact  Communication and risk governance are largely qualitative 
8,414,Solution to   
9,414,C is correct   Risk monitoring  mitigation and management require recognizing  and taking action when these  risk exposure and risk tolerance  are not in line  as shown in the middle of Exhibit     Risk governance involves setting the risk  tolerance  Risk identification and measurement involves identifying and mea  suring the risk exposures  
10,414,RISK GOVERNANCE
11,414,Risk governance is the foundation for risk management   As defined earlier it is the  top  down process and guidance that directs risk management activities to align with  and support the goals of the overall enterprise  It typically emanates from a board of  directors with fiduciary obligations and risk oversight and who prescribe goals and  authorities   Referring back to the definition of risk management  note that risk man  agement is keenly focused on the risk and value of the overall enterprise 
12,414,    An Enterprise View of Risk Governance
13,414,In addition to the responsibility for risk oversight  there are two other important  areas in which the governing body drives the risk framework   First  it determines the  organization s goals  direction and priorities  which combined serve as a key foun  dation for enterprise risk management   Recall that enterprise risk management is an  overarching governance approach applied across the entity that focuses risk activities  on the objectives  health and value of the whole organization  Second it spells out  the risk appetite or tolerance meaning which risks are acceptable which risks are to  be mitigated and to what extent  and which risks are unacceptable  Risk governance  should also provide a sense of the worst losses that could be tolerated in various  scenarios  and management should manage risk accordingly  These considerations  should flow naturally into decisions about risk budgeting to guide implementation of  an optimal program that is consistent with that risk tolerance  Risk governance is the impact of the governing body of an organization on the  risk management framework   It provides context for and clarity on an organization s  value drivers and risk appetite specifies clear authority to management to execute  risk management  and ensures risk oversight to continually determine whether  risk management is functioning well and consistent with the organization s value  maximization  It is the governing body  s job to tie the organizational goals and risk  framework together  thus  risk governance happens within an enterprise context  Risk

3,415,governance and risk oversight also entail compliance with regulatory requirements    Risk governance is a difficult and demanding discipline and if it is going to flourish  in an organization it needs visible commitment from the top  Providing clear guidance with sufficient leeway to execute strategy is often a dif  ficult balance  Even more challenging is providing for advance discussion and a clear  decision and statement of organizational risk appetite  There is usually substantial  discussion about this risk appetite after a crisis  but too often there is very little dis  cussion during periods of normalcy when it would be much more beneficial  Because  risk is one of the main strategic tools that management can regulate it is especially  important for governing bodies to openly discuss risk  consider scenarios  understand  the impact of negative outcomes on the organization and make it clear where they  are not willing to venture  Much like an automobile that comes with a red zone on  some dials to establish boundaries for safe operation risk governance bodies should  likewise establish hypothetical red zones to ensure the safe operation of their enterprise  Enterprise risk management  focusing risk activities on the objectives  health and  value of the whole organization  requires that the entire economic balance sheet of  the business be considered not just the assets or one part of the business in isolation   A narrower view of risk management is unlikely to meet the goal of maximizing the  value of the entire enterprise  Pension fund management provides a classic example of the importance of consid  ering enterprise risk management    Funds  are the assets and  pension  is the liability   But a true enterprise view requires an even broader outlook   A corporate pension  fund s manager might try to maximize only the fund s assets  but this would generally  do a disservice to the corporation  The assets and liabilities of a pension fund are both  sensitive to market variables  so ignoring the liabilities would be ignoring half the risk    With liabilities that are quite bond  like a pension fund manager using all equities  for maximum growth would potentially make the overall fund insolvent in a market  collapse with declining interest rates because in such a situation the liabilities would  increase substantially in value while the assets fell  Risk tolerance for the assets in  isolation would be far different from the risk tolerance of the entire enterprise  One  should look beyond just the pension liabilities  which are likely to be a small part of  the overall enterprise  Broader still a true enterprise risk view in this case would also  consider the parent corporation s business risk profile and not just the pension assets  and liabilities   In a market collapse the overall business might be in a recessionary  phase rendering increasing contributions from the corporation to its pension fund  quite painful  Factoring the corporate risk profile into the pension fund investment  strategy may cause the risk tolerance to be lower in this case  Risk governance that focuses on the entire enterprise will result in risk manage  ment that is much less likely to be at odds with the goals of the organization and more  likely to enhance long  run value  Likewise consideration of a full spectrum of risks   and not just the most obvious quantitative risks  will result in better risk governance  The enterprise view of risk management is equally applicable and important to an  individual even if the term  enterprise  is not often used in an individual context      The appropriate set of risks for an individual must be viewed not in isolation but in  consideration of the goals and characteristics of the individual in a holistic view  For  example an adviser may be designing an investment portfolio to maximize a client s  wealth and optimize the risk return trade  off at some perceived comfortable level  of risk     But the client  whose wealth consists not only of financial assets but also
4,415,   Enterprise risk management is actually an easier concept for an individual  compared with an organi  zation in which deciding  coordinating  and communicating goals can be a big challenge the scope of risk  management efforts for an individual is smaller and more manageable     Here the individual is the governing body setting individual goals and risk appetite  the financial pro  fessional or wealth manager is the  management team  executing much of the rest of the risk framework

3,416,of valuable human capital   might prefer that risk allocation decisions be made in  view of both forms of capital optimizing her total wealth  For example a client with  a career in real estate would most likely benefit if her financial portfolio is invested  in a way that considers her earnings exposure to real estate related risks   Holdings of  real estate securities above a certain level even if optimal from an isolated portfolio  perspective might make this individual less than optimally diversified from a total  wealth perspective  In another example Investor X who has substantial inflation   adjusted pension benefits  is different from Investor Y who has a fixed pension benefit  and different still from Investor Z  who has no pension benefit and retires with solely  his own investment portfolio  These three investors will require remarkably different  investment solutions  not only to deal with inflation but also to deal with the uncer  tainty surrounding lifespans   Individuals with different goals and characteristics will  need differing investment and risk solutions that are best suited to their individual  situations   In fact  because of the extremely variable life cycle of an individual and the  discrete nature of many individuals  goals  the enterprise view is even more important  to risk management for individuals than it is for institutions   Risk governance extends into management to include ways to ensure that the risk  framework of an organization stays consistent with top  level guidance  One useful  approach is to provide a regular forum to discuss the risk framework and key risk issues  at the management level  In other words  a risk management committee would be a  key element of good risk governance  Its activities could parallel the governance body  s  risk deliberations  but at an operational level as opposed to high  level oversight   In  this forum governance overlaps with many of the other aspects of the organization s  risk framework as discussed in Section    In fact  if done well it integrates all of them  In the same vein another element of good risk governance is the formal appoint  ment of a responsible executive as chief risk officer  CRO   This officer should be  responsible for building and implementing the risk framework for the enterprise and  managing the many activities therein  In the same manner that risks are inextrica  bly linked with the core business activities  the CRO is likewise a key participant in  the strategic decisions of the enterprise this position is not solely a policing role   Although the chief executive is responsible for risk as well as all other aspects of an  enterprise it makes no more sense for the CEO to perform the role of the CRO than  it would be for the CEO to perform the role of the CFO  Many financial firms now  have a CRO in executive management    which had become best practice even in the  years prior to the      crisis  
4,416,    Risk Tolerance
5,416,Perhaps the most important element of good risk governance is the risk tolerance  discussion and decision within the governing body  Business and investment strategy  centers on selecting a portfolio of acceptable risk activities that will maximize value  and produce the highest returns possible for the given risk level  At the governance  level the duty is generally not to select these activities a job that usually falls to  management but to establish the organization s risk appetite  Certain risks or levels of  risks may be deemed acceptable other risks deemed unacceptable and in the middle
6,416,   Human capital is a common term in economics and finance relating to the marketable skills of an  individual and the corresponding present value of future earnings to be generated by said skilled individ  ual  As with nearly any valuable asset  it is risky   for example the present value of an architect s lifetime  earnings stream is quite sensitive to equity market and real estate valuations as well as to interest rates    Risk considerations related to human capital will be important later in the curriculum     Although this is common for financial firms or other large organizations  many less  complex companies  will forgo a formal risk structure  The board still maintains its risk governance responsibilities   and it is  up to them to work out with management as to how and to what extent  to meet these responsibilities

3,417,are risks that may be pursued in a risk  limited fashion  Said differently risk tolerance  identifies the extent to which the entity is willing to experience losses or opportunity  costs and to fail in meeting its objectives     The enterprise risk management perspective is the right lens through which to  view the risk appetite question  The risk tolerance decision begins with two different  analyses that must be integrated an  inside  view and an  outside  view  First  what  shortfalls within an organization would cause it to fail or at least fail to achieve some  critical goals  Second what uncertain forces is the organization exposed to  That is   what are its risk drivers  With the answers to these two difficult questions in hand a  board could begin defining dimensions and levels of risk that it finds too uncomfortable  to take on  This risk tolerance should be formally chosen and communicated before a  crisis  and will serve as the high  level guidance for management in its strategic selection  of risks   Many organizations will do this after a crisis  which is better than not doing  it at all but is much like buying insurance after the loss occurs   It is best to take care  of it when there seems to be no particularly pressing reason to do so  Similarly some  individuals may not give much thought to their own risk tolerance until after a crisis  occurs  when they belatedly decide that the risk was not worth taking   For example suppose a Spanish construction equipment manufacturing company  s  board is determining its risk tolerance  From the inside perspective it has two main  concerns   revenue and liquidity  It determines that it can tolerate a        drop in  revenue but that a     drop would trigger its debt covenants and put the launch of its  new flagship product at risk   Related to this strategy it needs     million of cash flow  annually for the next three years for critical capital expenditures and can leave almost  none of this cash flow at risk   From the outside perspective it realizes that there are  three main uncertainties or risk drivers over which it has no control  changes in the  value of the US dollar interest rate changes  and market returns on industrial sector  equities   Both its business results and its own stock price are strongly correlated with  these three risks and could be adversely affected by any of them  Rather than taking a passive approach as a risk observer the board in this example  uses a top  level analysis to formulate its risk tolerance  In this case it may decide to  limit maximum cash flow variation to     million annually and revenue exposure to       in a global recession  In addition it may specify other stated limits  such as the  maximum exposure to currency or other risks   This guidance may affect the riskiness  of other product strategies that management may pursue  The company may require  more expensive financing options to reduce cash flow uncertainty  The governance  restrictions may drive risk mitigation programs  such as a hedging strategy especially  for the primary risk drivers that are stated areas of concern  Governance guidance is important in helping an enterprise target where it should  actively pursue risk and where it should mitigate or modify risk   Strategic goals centered  on core competencies should be pursued which leads the company into taking risks  that best position the enterprise for success and value creation  Companies sometimes  take risks in areas where they have no expertise which puts their core value creation  and their entire organization at peril  A well  functioning risk program would limit  or hedge those non  core risks in areas where they have no comparative advantage   Modifying risk is covered in detail in Section   
4,417,   The risk tolerance decision for an individual is similar but not identical to that of a business enter  prise  In traditional finance theory the individual focuses on maximizing unobservable utility whereas  the business maximizes a generally observable value the market value or equity price of the company   Although individuals are facing life and certain death on an uncertain timetable most businesses tend to  be relatively short  lived entities  but with an expectation of immortality  The decisions about risk toler  ance from those two very different viewpoints can be expected to differ for example risk tolerance in  organizations often treats its continued existence as a major consideration  In many ways  the individual s  risk tolerance decision is the harder one 
1,418,Risk Governance
2,418,   
3,418,How does a company determine its risk tolerance  There is certainly no formula    Most importantly a company  s goals  its expertise in certain areas  and its strategies  will help a board determine which risks the company may pursue and with how much  intensity  The ability of a company to respond dynamically to adverse events may  allow for a higher risk tolerance  The amount of loss a company can sustain without  impairing its status as a going concern should factor into its risk tolerance  some  companies are more fragile than others   The competitive landscape matters because  both the board s and investors  expectations are usually developed in the context of  how a company is positioned in its industry  The government and regulatory land  scape is important too both in their ex ante demands on how companies approach  risk and in the likely ex post reaction in the event of disasters   Quantitative analyses  such as scenario analysis  economic models  and sensitivities to macro risk drivers  might be used to assess where a board s zone of comfort is bounded  There are other  factors that should not determine risk tolerance but in many cases they do  Personal  motivations  beliefs  and agendas of board members  the agency problem   company  size  whether the market environment seems stable  short  term pressures   and man  agement compensation often affect risk tolerance in ways that might not be in line  with the owners  best interests   Once risk tolerance is determined the overall risk framework should be geared  toward measuring  managing  and communicating compliance with this risk toler  ance getting the risk exposure in line with the enterprise s risk appetite  This sort of governance exercise not only helps ensure that the organization sur  vives through the worst of times  but also helps ensure a strategic trade  off between  risk and return in the decision process  which in turn improves potential returns  for the given level of risk and value  It is quite easy to find business strategies and  investment approaches that produce apparently outsized returns  but they might be  at the cost of putting the organization at extreme risk   A somewhat extreme example  would be a company selling put options on its own equity which could produce higher  short  term profits but would dramatically increase the chance of the company failing  in a steep market decline  Excessive leverage is another risky strategy for boosting  short  term profits that may actually decrease value or lead to failure in the long run   A formal risk governance process with a stated risk tolerance would naturally result  in avoidance of many easier less well  reasoned strategies that entail excessive risk  compared with the firm s risk tolerance  Instead it would lead the strategic discussion  into alternative strategies that are more likely to actually add value while taking rea  sonable risk within the enterprise s risk tolerance and not simply trade ruin for return   Sincere good risk governance and risk culture can avoid excessively risky strategies  that might put the long  term enterprise value at risk   This approach should produce  enhanced value for the enterprise 
4,418,    Risk Budgeting
5,418,Risk budgeting picks up where risk tolerance leaves off  Whereas risk tolerance focuses  on the appetite for risk and what is and is not acceptable risk budgeting has a more  specific focus on how that risk is taken  Risk budgeting quantifies and allocates the  tolerable risk by specific metrics   it extends and guides implementation of the risk  tolerance decision  Risk budgeting applies to both business management and portfolio management  Its  foundation is the perspective that business or portfolio management involves assem  bling a number of risk activities or securities  which can be collated into an assemblage  of various risk characteristics   For example a traditional view of a portfolio might  be that it is allocated     to hedge funds      to private equity and the remaining      is split between stocks and bonds   An alternative risk view of the same portfolio  might be     driven by global equity returns      by domestic equity returns  with
1,419,   
2,419,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,419,the remaining     driven by interest rates   The equity component might be allocated      to value and     to growth  The portfolio might also have     illiquid securities  and the remainder liquid  Other allocations can be stated in terms of exposures to  inflation long  term interest rates  currencies  and so on  These multiple dimensions  for viewing the allocation of a portfolio are not mutually exclusive  they co  exist   If  one is evaluating the risk exposure of a portfolio and trying to keep it in line with a  stated risk tolerance one would be far more concerned with the risk characteristics  of the investment assets and portfolio rather than their common classifications of  stocks  hedge funds  real estate private equity and so on  These terms tell us a little  about risk but not enough  Equity is traditionally riskier than hedge funds  but some  equities are of quite low risk and some hedge funds are of quite high risk   The risk  view may be more meaningful and useful in understanding the portfolio risk than the  traditional asset allocation view  Risk budgeting is any means of allocating a portfolio based on some risk char  acteristics of the investments   In the purest sense the term  budget  implies that  there is a total risk limit for the organization  Although this approach is not formally  required   it would certainly be good practice to have a risk budget that is consistent  with the organization s risk tolerance  A risk budget provides a means of implementing  the risk tolerance at a strategic level or in other words  a means of bridging from the  high  level governance risk decision to the many management decisions  large and  small that result in the actual risk exposures   A risk budget can be complex and multi  dimensional or it can be a simple one   dimensional risk measure  Even the simplest measure can provide significant benefits in  developing an effective risk culture  Four well  known single  dimension measures that  are often used are standard deviation beta  value at risk  VaR  and scenario loss  but  there are many others   It is common for some hedge funds to budget risk using standard  deviation managing to a fixed  risk fund target  and evaluating individual investments  based on their returns and risks as they affect the ex ante standard deviation  More complex forms of risk budgeting use multiple dimensions of risk   One popular  approach evaluates risks by their underlying risk classes  such as equity fixed income  commodity risk  and so on and then allocates investments by their risk class   Also  common are risk factor approaches to risk budgeting  in which exposure to various  factors is used to attempt to capture associated risk premiums   An example would be  to budget an allocation to give greater emphasis to value stocks based on the belief  that they may provide a higher risk  adjusted return than growth stocks   This tactic  might be layered over a strategic budget with a certain  beta  as the overall equity  risk  supplemented with value and additional factor tilts specified up to some level  Risk budgeting  although a desirable element of risk governance cuts across the  entire risk management framework  providing a focal point for each of the facets of  risk management described in Section    And although it is true that in practice many  organizations operate without a risk budget  it is generally because there has been no  specific declaration of their risk tolerance  If a board has a clear understanding of its  risk appetite both the board and management will want some means of implementing  a strategic allocation that is consistent with it  Thus  the risk budget becomes a critical  overarching construct for the organization s risk framework   Some individuals may often through the assistance of a financial planner engage  in some form of risk budgeting  but many do not execute it well or carry it far enough   A classic example of this failure is the tendency of many individuals to invest their  financial portfolios in their employers   The risk budget for their total wealth financial
4,419,   One could do risk budgeting even if there were no other risk governance guidance

3,420,and human capital is extremely concentrated in one firm and or one industry  Not  surprisingly such risk budgets typically occur not through formal planning because  most formal plans would recognize the problem but through inaction or inattention  One major benefit of even the most basic risk budgeting is that it forces risk trade   offs and supports a culture in which risk is considered as a part of all key decisions    Suppose that all the activities a business wants to pursue are in excess of the risk  budget   The budgeting of risk should result in an approach whether explicit or not   of choosing to invest where the return per unit of risk is the highest   Better still it  should also result in a market  benchmarked choice of risk intensity between possibly  doing less of each risky investment or doing more but with a risk  mitigating hedge   This benefit is extremely important   By choosing between a market hedge or less of a  risky investment  one ends up evaluating the investment directly against the market  risk return benchmark   Thus  one is not only comparing risk return relationships  among one s investment choices  but also comparing active versus passive strategies    that is  evaluating investment choices as a whole against the  market return  on a  risk  equivalent basis   In other words  one ends up attempting to add active value in  each of one s decisions while still staying within the confines of the organization s risk  tolerance  The result is even more powerful than merely ensuring that the business is  compensated well for the risks they decide to accept   Just having a risk budget forces  decision makers to try to add value to the enterprise in every risky decision they make   The risk  budgeting framework makes this consideration innate to the decision process

3,421,B Chief financial officer C Risk management committee
4,421,Solution to   
5,421,B is correct   The enterprise view is characterized by a focus on the organization  as a whole its goals  value and risk tolerance  It is not about strategies or risks  at the individual business line level 
6,421,Solution to   
7,421,C is correct   Risk tolerance identifies the extent to which the organization is  willing to experience losses or opportunity costs and fail in meeting its objectives    It is best discussed before a crisis and is primarily a risk governance or oversight  issue at the board level not a management or tactical one 
8,421,Solution to   
9,421,C is correct   Risk budgeting is any means of allocating a portfolio by some risk  characteristics of the investments   This approach could be a strict limit on beta  or some other risk measure or an approach that uses risk classes or factors to  allocate investments   Risk budgeting does not require nor prohibit hedging   although hedging is available as an implementation tool to support risk budgeting  and overall risk governance 
10,421,Solution to   
11,421,B is correct  A chief risk officer or a risk management committee is an individual  or group that specializes in risk management   A chief financial officer may have  considerable knowledge of risk management  may supervise a CRO and would  likely have some involvement in a risk management committee but a CFO has  broader responsibilities and cannot provide the specialization and attention to  risk management that is necessary in a large organization

13,421,IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS
14,421,Having laid the framework for understanding the concept of risk management and  risk governance we now move into the implementation of the process   One of the  first important parts of the process is the identification of risks   In this reading  we  identify two general categorizations of risks   The first is the set of risks that originate  from the financial markets   Accordingly we refer to this type of risk as financial risks   The second group of risks includes those that emanate from outside the financial  markets   As such we refer to these as non  financial risks  Although most risks ulti  mately have monetary consequences  we reserve the term  financial risks  to refer to  the risks that arise from events occurring in the financial markets  such as changes in  prices or interest rates     Non  financial risks arise from other sources  such as actions  within an entity or from external origins  such as the environment  the community  regulators  politicians  suppliers  and customers   In this reading  we will consider  the types of financial and non  financial risks faced by organizations and individuals  
15,421,   We use the term  financial markets  in a very broad sense  A company may also be exposed to com  modity price risk  which we would include as a financial risk  
1,422,   
2,422,Identification of Risks
3,422,    Financial Risks
4,422,The risk management industry has come to classify three types of risks as primarily  financial in nature  The three primary types of financial risks are market risk  credit  risk  and liquidity risk   Market risk is the risk that arises from movements in interest  rates  stock prices  exchange rates  and commodity prices   This categorization is not  to say that these four main factors are the underlying drivers of market risks   Market  risks typically arise from certain fundamental economic conditions or events in the  economy or industry or developments in specific companies   These are the underlying  risk drivers  which we will cover later  Market risks are among the most obvious and visible risks faced by most organi  zations and many individuals   The financial markets receive considerable attention  in the media  and information on financial market activity is abundant   Institutional  investors and many corporations devote considerable resources to processing this  information with the objective of optimizing performance  Many individuals also  devote considerable attention to market risk  and financial publications and television  and radio shows are widely followed in the general population  The state of knowledge  in risk management is probably greatest in the area of market risk   The second primary financial risk is credit risk   Credit risk is the risk of loss if one  party fails to pay an amount owed on an obligation such as a bond loan or derivative  to another party  In a loan only one party owes money to the other  In some types of  derivatives  only one party owes money to the other and in other types of derivatives   either party can owe the other  This type of risk is also sometimes called default risk  and sometimes counterparty risk   As with market risk  the root source of the risk  can arise from fundamental conditions in the economy industry or weakness in the  market for a company  s products   Ultimately default is an asset  specific risk   Bond  and derivatives investors must consider credit risk as one of their primary decision  tools     Similar to market risk  credit risk is also a highly visible risk with considerable  attention paid to defaults  bankruptcies  and the stresses arising from inadequate  cash flow in relation to leverage  Credit risk is a particularly significant risk in that  although market prices can go down and bounce back up defaults and bankruptcies  have extremely long  term implications for borrowers   Although market and credit risk are extremely common risks to institutions  they  are also assumed by individuals in their personal investments   One other financial  risk  however is much more common to institutions  although it can be faced by  individuals  often unknowingly  This third risk is liquidity risk which is the risk of a  significant downward valuation adjustment when selling a financial asset   In order to  sell an asset a party may need to reduce the price to a level that is less than the marked  value or the seller  s assessment of the asset s true value based on the fundamentals  of the asset   In certain market conditions  the seller must make a significant price  concession  Having to make price concessions is not necessarily unusual and does  not imply a poorly functioning market   Indeed given no shift in demand a rightward  shift of a supply curve in order to sell a larger quantity is entirely consistent with the  notion that a seller must lower the price to sell a greater quantity  All assets have transaction costs in the market  such as the bid ask spread  The  existence of a sell price that is less than a buy price however is not a risk but simply  a cost   It is the uncertainty of that valuation spread that creates this type of risk   Thus   liquidity risk could also be called  transaction cost risk    The liquidity risk of a      stock purchased for     is not the risk that one would receive the  bid  price of only        right after one bought it   That       spread is a known cost when the stock is
5,422,   With certain derivatives  swaps and forwards  either party could be forced to pay off to the other  so each party is concerned about whether its counterparty will pay off meaning that for some products   credit risk is bilateral

2,423,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,423,purchased so it is not a risk   The risk is that this spread cost might increase dramat  ically as a result of either changing market conditions or attempting to maintain a  position significantly larger than the normal trading volume for the stock   This problem  becomes a serious issue for risk management when the liquidation price falls to less  than the seller  s estimate of the fundamental value of the asset   Although this risk is  often associated with illiquid assets    it really stems from a couple of sources   First   market liquidity varies over time and the market for specific assets may become less  liquid  second as the size of a position increases  the cost and uncertainty associated  with liquidating it will increase  In some extreme cases  there may be no price above  zero at which the seller can sell the asset   Of course one might argue that the cost of illiquidity and liquidity risk  should  thus be part of the investor  s assessment of fundamental value and indeed it is for  many analysts   If not  liquidity risk can sometimes be confused with a form of valu  ation denial in which investors believe that they paid an appropriate price and that  the market has not converged to its true value  But less liquidity means a thin market  and a lack of investor interest  which may be fertile ground for investment opportu  nities   Although lack of liquidity can offer benefits  such as the opportunity to buy an  asset well before everyone else sees that it is an attractive investment  liquidity risk  is generally considered to be a negative factor with which risk managers and indeed  all investors must contend 
4,423,    Non  Financial Risks
5,423,Recall that we refer to financial risks as those arising primarily from changes in prices  and rates in financial markets   Although most risks have monetary consequences   there are a number of risks that are typically classified as non  financial in nature   These risks arise from a variety of sources  such as the relationship between the entity  and counterparties  regulators  governments  the environment  suppliers  customers   and employees   One important risk of this type is closely related to default risk but deals more  with the settling of payments that occur just before a default   This risk is called settle  ment risk   As an example suppose Party A enters into a forward contract to purchase       million of Japanese government bonds from Party B  Now at expiration if all goes  well Party A would wire the money and Party B would transfer the bonds   Each party  fulfills its obligation expecting that the other will do so as well  Now suppose Party  A wires the money but Party B does not send the bonds  and in fact  Party B declares  bankruptcy  At this point  Party A cannot get the money back  except possibly much  later through the potentially slow and cumbersome bankruptcy process     Although  the financial consequences are very high the root source of this risk is the timing of  the payment process itself  Entities face two types of risks related to the law and as such this risk is referred  to as legal risk   One risk is simply the risk of being sued over a transaction or for that  matter anything an entity does or fails to do  In financial risk management  however  the major legal concern is that the terms of a contract will not be upheld by the legal  system  For example suppose Bank E enters into a derivatives contract with Party F 
6,423,   The illiquid nature of an asset is not itself the risk because that is a direct cost borne immediately  upon purchase  Still uncertainty around the valuation of illiquid assets is a pervasive issue so it is natural  to associate liquidity risk with liquidity characteristics   More importantly though the term liquidity risk  also commonly refers to a much broader set of risks for the entity which are addressed in the next section     This type of risk often arises because of significant time zone differences   Settlement risk is also called  Herstatt risk   Herstatt was the name of a German bank that failed in      after receiving  overnight  pay  ments and then defaulting   More recently in the case of Lehman Brothers in      in addition to obvious  and serious counterparty issues  there were settlement losses  especially related to overseas subsidiaries

3,424,Assume that as the underlying changes in price Party F incurs a loss  whereas there is  a corresponding gain to Bank E   But suppose that Party F then identifies a legal issue  that it interprets as giving it the right to refuse to pay  If the court upholds Party F s  position Bank E could incur a loss   Litigation always involves uncertainty because  even a seemingly weak case can prevail in court   The following three non  financial risks are related  regulatory risk  accounting risk   and tax risk   They could even be collectively referred to as compliance risk because  they all deal with the matter of conforming to policies  laws  rules  and regulations  as set forth by governments and authoritative bodies  such as accounting governing  boards   Obviously the regulatory accounting  and tax environment is always subject  to change but the rapid expansion of financial products and strategies in relation to  the relatively slow manner in which government and private regulators are able to  respond means that laws and regulations are nearly always catching up with the finan  cial world  When these laws and regulations are updated it can result in significant  unexpected costs  back taxes  financial restatements  and penalties   Another type of non  financial risk is model risk  which is the risk of a valuation  error from improperly using a model  This risk arises when an organization uses the  wrong model or uses the right model incorrectly  A simple example applicable to both  a portfolio manager and a corporate analyst is the assumption of constant dividend  growth in the dividend discount model when in fact  growth is not constant   Closely related to model risk is tail risk more events in the tail of the distribution  than would be expected by probability models   This risk is a facet of market risk  but  it also infects valuations and models when it is ignored or mishandled  Tail risk is  known to be especially severe for the normal distribution which tends to be overused  in modeling   As an example consider the monthly returns on the S P     Index from       to       The monthly average return was      and the monthly standard devia  tion was        If we rank the monthly returns  we would find that the largest negative  return was         which occurred in the well  known market crash of October        With a normal distribution we would find that a return that low would occur only  once every         years     The second and third worst monthly returns of           October        and          August        would occur only once every      and      years respectively  If the normal distribution is a realistic descriptor of returns   results of these magnitudes should never have occurred in recorded market history  and yet we have seen three such instances   Interestingly according to the normal  distribution the largest positive return of        in October      would occur only  once every     years   Technically one could argue that if we go another          years and do not observe a monthly return as low as         then the assumption of  a normal distribution might seem reasonable but it seems safe to reject the normal  distribution for at least another two million years   Similar comments can apply to the  second and third worst returns albeit over shorter periods   Many quantitative models  e g   option models  and decision models  e g   port  folio construction and asset allocation relying on standard deviation in analysis and  decisions  ignore the existence of fat tails in returns   as a result  market risk is often  considered and dealt with in an oversimplified fashion    Tail risk  as the term is used  in practice is important and is discussed separately because financial professionals  realize the implicit failure of modeling market risk   More plainly ignoring tail risk is
4,424,   This calculation and those that follow are based on determining the probability of the given return or less      A related model risk normally lumped in with tail risk is that of unstable parameters or changing regimes  because these are pathologies that can produce returns that appear fat  tailed  A simple recent and realistic  example is changing correlations   Suppose that everybody believes that the equity commodity correlation  is     and uses models for portfolio construction and diversification based on that relationship  If the true  correlation suddenly changes to     such as during a financial crisis  then all the model prescriptions become  not just useless but harmful  Portfolio diversification turns out far less than expected risk is higher than  expected and the  optimal  allocation to commodities turns out to be very wrong

3,425,a form of model risk   And although tail risk might seem more of a financial risk than  a non  financial risk  the mistake occurs internally arising from poor choices made  in modeling   Most of the internal risks faced by an organization are often grouped together and  referred to as operational risk   Operational risk is the risk that arises from the people  and processes that combine to produce the output of an organization  Although the  factors that give rise to such risks can arise externally the risks themselves are largely  internal to an organization because it would be expected to have its people and pro  cesses functioning effectively regardless of pressures placed on it by external forces    For example a hacker breaking into a company  s computer system and stealing credit  cards is an external force  Hacking  however is not simply a random act of mischief   Companies are aware of the threat of hackers  and hackers can break in to a system  only if that system is vulnerable  An organization is responsible for establishing suf  ficiently tight computer security to deter hackers from breaking in and stealing or  doing mischief  In addition to the threats posed by hackers and viruses  even secure  computers themselves are a particular source of risk   Programming errors and bugs  can create the possibility of costly mistakes   Employees themselves are major sources of potential internal risks   Banks are  keenly aware of the vulnerability to employee theft  given the ease with which so  many employees have access to accounts and systems for making entries   But even  perfectly honest employees make mistakes and some can be quite costly  The employee  who credits someone s account         for a      deposit may have made an hon  est mistake but it is a mistake that could quickly lead to the rapid disappearance of  money  In the past  employees up to senior management have been guilty of perpe  trating accounting fraud not necessarily for their own direct benefit but to make the  company look better  In banks and other companies that trade in the financial markets  there is the risk  that a trader or portfolio manager will fail to follow laws  rules  or guidelines and  put the company at great financial risk   This individual is commonly described as a   rogue trader   Personified by Nick Leeson of Barings Bank  who in      destroyed the       year old company by engaging in a series of highly speculative trades to cover up  losses  the rogue trader has become a standard concern of risk managers   Although  it was never clear if Leeson s trades were truly unauthorized his legacy left the fear  that institutions bear the risk that one trader can imperil the entire organization by  making large and highly speculative trades that put the bank s entire capital base at  risk     In essence a rogue trader is a trader who engages in risky transactions without  regard for the organization s limits or conforming to its controls   Companies are also threatened by business interruptions  such as the weather  Not  only can weather temporarily shut down a company but it can do serious long  term  damage  Although weather is an external force that is completely out of the control  of an organization it does not excuse the organization from having the appropriate  internal procedures for managing weather  related problems   Simple and fairly low   cost actions  such as having generators  sleeping quarters  and food available can go  a long way toward keeping employees around and working when roads are closed  and electricity is off  Airlines are particularly experienced in quickly adjusting their  schedules to the weather  Yet  some companies have not heeded inclement weather  forecasts   Failing to react to the warnings of hurricanes and dangerous snowstorms  can result in considerable loss  
4,425,   Although Leeson may have been the origin of the term  rogue trader  he has certainly not been the  largest rogue trader  For example the trading of Bruno Iksil a credit default swaps trader in the London office  of JPMorgan Chase resulted in a    billion loss for one of Wall Street s most stable financial institutions    Unlike Barings  however JPMorgan Chase survived the financial loss but suffered great embarrassment  and was fined almost a billion dollars by regulators

3,426,Terrorism is another form of operational risks that poses a threat to organizations  and individuals   The      attacks on the World Trade Center led many companies to  recognize that the New York City financial district was a major terrorist target and  that  as such their operations could be shut down by these acts of violence  When the  more destructive attacks of    September      occurred many companies had already  established backup operations sufficiently far away from that area   Of course such  risk is not confined to major financial centers  and indeed organizations worldwide  have begun to take security measures that address this operational risk   Some of these operational risks are insurable at least to a modest extent   We  will briefly discuss insurance later but most companies would much prefer to take  proactive steps toward prevention than to incur the inconvenience of losses and then  have an outside entity compensate them for their losses   Solvency risk is the risk that the entity does not survive or succeed because it  runs out of cash even though it might otherwise be solvent     This was probably the  most underappreciated component of risk prior to the financial crisis of         The  collapse of Lehman Brothers was often associated with an excess of leverage which  was certainly a key factor in its failure  But it was solvency risk that forced the com  pany into bankruptcy  Almost overnight Lehman s liquidity disappeared because most  funding sources would no longer willingly bear Lehman s counterparty risk   Even if  it had experienced large market gains on the day it went under it had already been  destroyed by solvency risk   Across the entire financial industry from hedge funds to  pension funds  painful but valuable lessons were learned about the critical impor  tance of funds availability and solvency risk  even if all other risks were well  aligned   Solvency risk is now viewed as one of the key factors in running a successful hedge  fund because investors are extremely sensitive to not recovering their investment in  the event of a  run on the fund   Solvency in the personal or institutional sense is the availability of funding to  continue to operate without liquidating or at a less extreme level to be able to  make good on liabilities and meet one s cash flow requirements   Solvency risk is the  ultimate example of the importance of taking an enterprise view of risk management    For example a university  s investment officer might have a perfectly well  balanced  set of risks in the endowment portfolio when viewed in isolation  But as a part of a  university the portfolio may be affected by a deep recession because the university  s  professional degree revenue grant money and donations will fall at the same time as  the portfolio s investment value and cash distributions are in decline  Although the  endowment and university may survive it might be necessary for the endowment to  take many emergency actions that impair its value simply attributable to the overall  solvency risk and the ultimate need of the enterprise to not run out of cash  Solvency risk is easily mitigated though never eliminated by a large number of  possible safeguards  none of which is free  Many businesses produce short  term higher  returns by essentially ignoring solvency risk  but in doing so they are not managing risk  very well  Since the      crisis  most businesses are keenly aware of the consequences  of bad solvency management and have taken such steps as using less leverage securing  more stable sources of financing  investing in models to provide more transparency  on solvency risk  incorporating solvency risk at an enterprise level in risk governance  and holding more cash equivalents and assets with less liquidity risk  
4,426,   Solvency risk is often referred to as liquidity risk by industry professionals  even though the expression  liquidity risk was used earlier to refer to the risk of valuation shock when selling a security  Although the  term  liquidity risk  is used in practice in both contexts  in this reading we will refer to the risk relating to  the cash position of an entity as  solvency risk       Bank runs are perhaps the simplest example of solvency risk   An otherwise solvent bank can easily be  ruined by a bank run that wipes out its ability to make good on short  term liabilities   Bank runs are not  uncommon occurrences in history so solvency risk certainly long predates the      crisis

3,427,Individuals can also face a number of risks of an operational nature  These include  hackers breaking into one s computer and the threat of burglary and robbery  One  of the most commonly cited risks for individuals is identity theft   For individuals   however we consider their primary non  financial risks to be related to their life and  health as well as other life  changing events   Obviously the health of an individual is an extremely important risk   Poor health  can result from poor choices in life but it can also arise from factors that are outside  the control of the individual  These risks can result in direct health care expenses   reduced income because of disability and reduced lifespan or quality of life  People  vary widely in the risk management strategies they undertake to control their health  such as in their choices in diet  exercise preventive health care and avoidance of  undue health risks   Some individuals address only their financial exposure to health  risks  and still others do not take proactive steps to address this risk at all  Closely related to health risk is mortality risk the risk of dying relatively young  and longevity risk the risk of outliving one s financial resources   Not only are these  risks a primary determinant of the quality of life they are also critical factors in  investment planning   Although it is probably desirable not to know when one will die  financial planning for one s years in retirement is heavily dependent on one s mortal  ity assumption  Insurance companies  defined benefit pension plans  and vendors of  retirement annuities need only know the group average mortality  Mortality tables  are reasonably accurate so these institutions have relatively precise estimates of death  rates for groups as a whole  Individuals themselves  however clearly do not know  how long they will live  People who use defined contribution plans must therefore  build portfolios and control retirement distributions so that their assets outlive them  which is difficult to do when they do not know when they will die  No one wants to  outlive their money but with an increasingly aging population and good health care  this problem is becoming a greater concern  There are a number of other major non  financial risks that individuals face which  are generally involved with some sort of life  changing disaster  The largest ones fire  natural disaster or massive liability stemming from harming others  such as in a car  accident are generally considered  property and casualty   risks and are insured as  such  Individuals also face another non  financial risk that  although not common does  seem to be growing   This risk is the possibility that the individual will be cheated by  a financial adviser  Whether an adviser simply charges too much for their services   steals a small amount of money or engages in a massive Ponzi scheme individuals  may face a high risk of loss from their advisers   Although the overwhelming majority  of financial advisers are honest  the amount of money at stake has proven to be a  significant temptation for an unscrupulous few 
4,427,    Interactions between Risks
5,427,In some cases  a risk classified into one category could easily have been classified into  another  Indeed the interactions between risks are numerous   It has been said that  market risk begets credit risk  which begets operational risk   That is  given unexpected  market moves  one party then owes the other party money  Given the debtor creditor  nature of the relationship the two parties must have internal operations that process  the transactions and pay or collect the money  Thus  whenever there is credit risk   there is settlement risk   If there were no market risk  the other risks in the chain would  likely be relatively minor  Legal risk often arises from market or credit risk   Large  market moves create losses for one party  There is a long history of parties searching  for loopholes in contracts and suing to avoid incurring the loss  
1,428,Identification of Risks
2,428,   
3,428,One simple example of an adverse risk interaction is counterparty risk   When  trading a derivative contract  it is important to consider the cost of counterparty  risk   Suppose Party A buys an out  of  the  money put option with a strike price of        a contract theoretically worth      entitling him to as much as       from  Counterparty C if an underlying equity index is down  But there is a    chance that  C could default   and assume that the possibility of default is considered independent  of the performance of the equity market   This transaction with payoffs adjusted for  the possibility of default  might price at  say     to A   But in reality the credit risk  of C  s default is likely dependent on the equity market return  If the probability dis  tribution of default risk overlaps substantially with that of the market being down  which is a likely scenario then the risks interact and the cost of risk is higher  In this  example perhaps the probability of C defaulting is     or more when the put option  is in the money  So A s expected payoff is lower as a result of facing a credit risk that  is compounded by market risk   In fact  it is quite likely that in the extreme event a  deep decline in the equity market when A would presumably receive       Party  A will in all likelihood get nothing   Thus  the investor bears much more risk than  initially thought as a result of the failure to consider the interaction of the two risks    And in doing so Party A overpaid for the contract   This sort of risk interaction is so  common in markets that practitioners have given it a very fitting term  wrong  way  risk    In fact  it was extremely common in the financial crisis of      when holders of  many securities based on mortgage credit believed that the risks were well  diversified  when in truth the risks were quite systematic  Another example of interacting risks was experienced by many banks  funds  and  private investment partnerships in      as well as the hedge fund Long  Term Capital  Management in       Leverage which manifested itself in higher market risk  inter  acted in an extremely toxic manner with liquidity risk and solvency risk and impaired  or shuttered many investment firms     In most adverse financial risk interactions  the whole is much worse than the sum  of its parts   the combined risk compounds the individual risks in a non  linear manner   For this example a    levered entity might produce a    loss when its unlevered twin  or baseline risk bears a    loss   If liquidity is a serious issue for the entity then at a      baseline loss  the entity might face some moderate distress from liquidity or funding  problems that it ends up losing     instead of      It would not be surprising if this  entity failed at a     baseline loss because of the toxic interplay between levered risk  and liquidity problems   This resulting non  linear reaction to risk drivers exists across  many risk interactions in many markets  making up  front scenario planning even more  valuable to the risk process  a point we will return to later  Earlier we briefly described a common example of interacting risks for individuals    Suppose an individual works for a publicly traded company and through an incentive  program receives shares of the company in her company retirement portfolio or for  her personal holdings   Company policies may require that employees hold on to these  shares for a number of years   When that time has elapsed however many individuals  fail to recognize the incredibly concentrated risk they are assuming  so they hold on  to their shares   An employee s reasoning for not selling the shares is often that the  company she works for has been a solid performing company for many years  so she  feels no reason to worry  Moreover the team spirit often imbued in employees gen  erates pride that can make employees believe that there is no better place in which  to work and to invest their money  But if something goes wrong in the company or  the industry the employee may lose her job and her savings an incredibly adverse
4,428,   This example illustrates yet another risk  systemic risk  that is a significant concern to regulators and  governments   Stresses and failures in one sector transmit to stresses and failures in other sectors  which  can ultimately impact an entire economy  Systemic risk is the ultimate example of interactions among risks

3,429,interaction between market risk and human capital risk   In      Enron was a sad  example with many loyal and honest employees losing virtually all of their retirement  savings by failing to recognize this risk   In sum it is important to recognize that risks do not usually arise independently  but generally interact with one another a problem that is even more critical in stressed  market conditions   The resulting combined risk is practically always non  linear in that  the total risk faced is worse than the sum of the risks of the separate components    Most risk models and systems do not directly account for risk interactions  which  makes the consequences of the risk interaction even worse  Governance bodies   company management  and financial analysts should be keenly aware of the potential  risk and damage of risks in combination and be aware of the dangers of treating risks  as separate and unrelated

3,430,B Covariance risk associated with their human capital and their invest  ment portfolios   C The interacting effects of solvency risk and the risk of being taken  advantage of by an unscrupulous financial adviser 
4,430,Solution to   
5,430,C is correct   Operational risk is the only risk listed that is considered non   financial even though it may have financial consequences   Credit and market  risks derive from the possibility of default and market movements  respectively  and along with liquidity risk  are considered financial risks  
6,430,Solution to   
7,430,C is correct   Although most risks are likely to be interconnected in some way  in some cases the risks an entity is exposed to will interact in such a way that  a loss  or gain  in one exposure will lead directly to a loss in a different expo  sure as well such as with many counterparty contracts   Conditions in A and  B are much more directly linked in that market participants fully expect what  follows for example in B an outbreak of war in one region of the world could  well cause widespread uncertainty   a flight to quality such as to government   backed securities   and a widening in spreads for credit  risky securities   In C  in  contrast  the reduction in creditworthiness following the market decline may  be expected but owing more money on an already existing contract as a result  comes from the interaction of risks  
8,430,Solution to   
9,430,A is correct because this risk arises from the financial markets  
10,430,Solution to   
11,430,C is correct   The risk  free rate is generally the appropriate rate to use in dis  counting government bonds   Although government bonds are generally default  free their returns are certainly risky  Assuming a returns distribution has thin  tails when it does not and assuming symmetry in an asymmetric distribution  are both forms of model risk  
12,430,Solution to   
13,430,A is correct  Securities vary highly in how liquid they are  Those with low liquidity  are those for which either the number of agents willing to invest or the amount  of capital these agents are willing to invest is limited  When markets are stressed  these limited number of investors or small amount of capital dry up leading to  the inability to sell the security at any price the seller feels is reasonable  Systemic  risk is the risk of failure of the entire financial system and a much broader risk  than liquidity risk   Wrong  way risk is the extent to which one s exposure to a  counterparty is positively related to the counterparty  s credit risk  
14,430,Solution to   
15,430,A is correct   The uncertainty about death creates two risks   mortality risk and  longevity risk   The mortality risk  risk of dying relatively young  is manifested  by a termination of the income stream generated by the person  In contrast   longevity risk is the risk of outliving one s financial resources

4,431,MEASURING AND MODIFYING RISKS
5,431,The core element of risk management is the measurement and modification of risk    One cannot modify risk without measuring it   The primary purpose of measuring risk  is to determine whether the risk being taken or being considered is consistent with  the pre  defined risk tolerance  To understand how risk is measured it is important  to understand the basic elements that drive risk  
6,431,    Drivers
7,431,This section illustrates the origins of risk   Risk is a part of life itself  None of us knows  from one day to the next everything that will happen to us in the next    hours  let  alone over a longer period  We may get a phone call that a relative is extremely sick   or we may be contacted by a head  hunter about an attractive job possibility  We may  learn that we are going to be given an award from a prestigious organization or we  may find that our identity has been stolen  All of us can almost surely name something  that happened the previous day that was not anticipated  Most of these happenings  are minor and often quickly forgotten  Others are serious   Some are good  Some are  bad  Some are unpredictable outcomes of known events  such as whether we get an  offer following a job interview or whether a medical test reveals that we are healthy  or ill  Some events are completely unanticipated such as getting a phone call from an  old friend we have not talked to in many years or having a flat tire on the drive home   Fortunately the vast majority of risks in life are minor  The ones that are not minor  however have the potential to be highly unpredictable and financially and sometimes  physically and emotionally quite costly  In a conceptual sense financial risks are no different from the other risks we face  in life  All risks arise from the fact that the future is unknown  Financial risks largely  emanate from economic risks  and economic risks emanate from the uncertainties  of life  Financial markets generate prices that fluctuate as investors absorb information  about the global and domestic state of the economy the company  s industry and the  idiosyncratic characteristics of the company itself  Global and domestic macroeco  nomies are driven by the companies that operate within them but much of the tone  as well as the ground rules are set by governments and quasi  governmental agencies   such as central banks   Taxes  regulations  laws  and monetary and fiscal policy establish  a legal and economic environment and a set of ground rules that greatly affect the  degree and quality of economic activity that takes place  Attempts by governments  and central banks of different countries to coordinate economic policies can lead to  some degrees of success if harmonized but if not  they can create an environment in  which companies engage in practices designed to seek favorable treatment in some  countries and avoid unfavorable treatment in others     All economies  in turn are composed of industries   Government policies also  affect industries  in some cases encouraging economic activity in some industries  while discouraging it in others   Some industries are stable weathering macroeconomic  storms quite well whereas others are highly cyclical 
8,431,   This practice is sometimes called regulatory arbitrage  The policies of certain countries can be more  conducive to establishing operations   Examples are the flow of money into countries whose banking laws  are less restrictive and more conducive to secrecy and incorporation in or moving a company to a country  with lighter regulations or more favorable tax treatment  
1,432,Measuring and Modifying Risks
2,432,   
3,432,The uncertainties of global and domestic macroeconomic and central bank policies  create risks for economies and industries that we often treat as systematic  Seemingly  minor events  such as filling the position of central bank chairperson are often viewed  by investors as major events  signaling possibly a change in policy that can greatly  affect the macroeconomy and possibly certain industries   Moving down to a more fundamental level investors face the unsystematic or  idiosyncratic risks of individual companies   Modern investment analysis prescribes  that diversified portfolios bear no unsystematic risk   We are then led to believe that  unsystematic risk does not matter in a well  diversified portfolio  But unsystematic  risk does matter to the management of a company  It also matters to poorly diver  sified investors   And it certainly matters to the financial analysts who cover specific  companies   And what would appear to be unsystematic risk can oftentimes actually  be systematic  For example poor credit risk management by a major bank can turn  into a global financial crisis if that bank is  too big to fail   In sum the basic drivers of risk arise from global and domestic macroeconomies   industries  and individual companies   Risk management can control some of this risk   but it cannot control all of it   For example the risk manager of a company may be able  to reduce the likelihood that his company will default  but he cannot control move  ments in interest rates   For the latter risk  he must accept that interest rate volatility  is a given and that he can only position the company to be able to ensure that its risk  exposure is aligned with its objective and risk tolerance  In order to do so he must  first be able to measure the risk  
4,432,    Metrics
5,432,The notion of metrics in the context of risk refers to the quantitative measures of risk  exposure  The most basic metric associated with risk is probability  Probability is a  measure of the relative frequency with which one would expect an outcome series  of outcomes  or range of outcomes to occur  One can speak about the probability of  rolling a six in one roll of a die as     the chance of rain in the next    hours as      or the odds of a central bank taking actions to increase interest rates of      These  are all probabilities  differing in concept by the fact that the die roll is associated  with an objective probability measure whereas the other two examples are subjective  probabilities   It is important to note that probability in and of itself is not a sufficient  metric of risk   A chance of financial loss of     does not tell us everything we need  to know  There are other measures of risk that incorporate probability but give us  more information  The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion in a probability distribution   Although there is a formal mathematical definition of standard deviation at this point  we need only understand the conceptual definition  Standard deviation measures a  range over which a certain percentage of the outcomes would be expected to occur   For example in a normal distribution about     of the time the outcomes will lie  within plus or minus one standard deviation of the expected value  Two standard  deviations in both directions would cover about     of the outcomes  whereas three  would encompass     of the outcomes   Although standard deviation or volatility  is widely used in the financial world it does have significant limitations   In partic  ular standard deviation may not be an appropriate measure of risk for non  normal  distributions   Standard deviation may not exist for return distributions with fat tails   Moreover according to modern portfolio theory the risk captured by an asset s  standard deviation overstates the risk of that asset s returns in the context of a diver  sified portfolio  Investors can easily diversify their holdings  thereby eliminating a  portion of the risk in their portfolios by diversifying away the security  specific risk    As a result  most financial valuation theories assert that the ability of investors to  eliminate security  specific risk  or non  systematic risk  means that investors should

4,433,   Earlier we discussed the fact that unsystematic risk matters to some parties   Here we seem to be saying  that it should not matter to anyone  Capital market models almost always assume that investors can diversify  quite easily and as a result  they should not expect to earn a premium for bearing diversifiable risk   This  assumption does not mean that everyone s wealth is well  diversified  Investors who do not diversify prob  ably cannot expect to earn a return for bearing diversifiable risk  but it does not mean that these investors  should not care about measuring the risk they choose to assume by not diversifying      The notion of a first  order risk versus a second  order risk can be seen by considering the following    Suppose A affects B and B in turn affects C   A does not affect C directly but does so only indirectly  A  is a first  order risk for B and a second  order risk for C   In the case of options  small market movements  affect an option price through the option s delta   As long as the movements are small the delta is relatively  stable  If the movements are large the delta itself will move creating gamma risk that arises as a result  of the non  linear valuation function of the option  Of course it is natural to wonder what it means to say  that a movement passes from the notion of  small  to the notion of  large   Unfortunately the passage from  small to large does not cross an identifiable border     Options on interest rates  however have a high sensitivity to interest rates  but only because interest  rates are the underlying  and thus  the source of market risk

3,434,London bank determines that its VaR is    million at    for one day  This statement  means that the bank expects to lose a minimum of    million in one day    of the  time  A critical and often overlooked word is minimum  In this example the bank  expects that its losses will be at least    million in one day with    probability  In a  VaR measure there is no ultimate maximum that one can state  VaR is thus a min  imum extreme loss metric  With a probability of    and a measurement period of  one day we can interpret the bank s VaR as expecting a minimum loss of    million  once every    business days   VaR can also be used to measure credit losses  although  the construction of the measure is considerably more difficult given the extreme  asymmetry of the risk   VaR is a simple but controversial measure  There are several ways to estimate VaR   each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages   The different measures can  lead to highly diverse estimates   Moreover VaR is subject to the same model risk as  derivative pricing models   VaR is based on a particular assumption about the probability  distribution of returns or profits   If that assumption is incorrect the VaR estimate will  be incorrect   VaR also requires certain inputs   If those inputs are incorrect  the VaR  estimate will be incorrect   Many critics of VaR have argued that naive users of VaR  can be lulled into a false sense of security  A presumably tolerable VaR can give the  illusion that the risk is under control when in fact  it is not   Yet  VaR is accepted as  a risk measure by most banking regulators and is approved for disclosure purposes  in typical accounting standards   As with any risk measure one should supplement it  with other measures   As emphasized earlier VaR does not tell the maximum loss   The maximum loss is  the entire equity of an organization or the entire value of a portfolio but the statistics  used to estimate VaR can be used to gauge average extreme losses   Conditional VaR  or CVaR is a common tail loss measure defined as the weighted average of all loss  outcomes in the statistical distribution that exceed the VaR loss   Another tail risk  metric in the credit risk space that is analogous to CVaR is expected loss given default  which answers the question for a debt security  If the underlying company or asset  defaults  how much do we lose on average   VaR focuses on the left tail of the distribution and purports to tell us the expected  frequency of extreme negative returns  but it can understate the actual risk   For  example the normal distribution gives us a well  defined measure of extreme negative  returns  which are balanced by extreme positive returns   Yet  actual historical return  distributions have shown that there are more extreme negative returns than would be  expected under the normal distribution  We previously described this concern in the  form of tail risk   In response to this concern statisticians have developed a branch  of study that focuses primarily on extreme outcomes  which is called extreme value  theory and leads to measures of the statistical characteristics of outcomes that occur  in the tails of the distribution  There are mathematical rules that define the statistical  properties of such large outcomes  and these rules have been widely used for years  in the insurance business   In the past    years or so risk managers have taken to  using them to help gauge the likelihood of outcomes that exceed those that would  normally be expected  Two measures in particular that are often used to complement VaR are scenario  analysis and stress testing  These are common sense approaches that ask  If this  happens  then how are we affected   Scenario analysis can be thought of as a package  of stress tests  usually with some common underlying theme  A scenario defines a set  of conditions or market movements that could occur and would put some pressure  on a portfolio  An example might be a sharp increase in interest rates coupled with  a significant decline in the value of a currency  The portfolio is then evaluated to  determine its expected loss under these scenarios   A different means of posing a sce  nario analysis is stress testing  which is done by proposing specific asset price moves  generally involving extremely large and high pressure scenarios that would occur only

3,436,is difficult to quantify  As with credit risk  significant operational risk events are rare  but usually quite costly if they do occur  Hence attempts to quantify the risk usually  involve a third party aggregating operational risk events across numerous companies  and publishing the statistics   As mentioned there are numerous other risks that would likewise be difficult to  measure  For example there is always the possibility of changes in accounting rules   laws  tax rates  and regulatory requirements that can result in significant costs as  companies adapt their policies and actions from one regulatory environment to a new  one  How would one measure such risks  Moreover the time period spanned by these  risks is extremely long  and in fact  theoretically infinite  Changes in these rules and  laws are often motivated by politics   How does one quantify such risks when there  are no real numeric measures  Analysis invariably reverts to subjective evaluation of  the likelihood of such threats and their potential losses   As we have described many risks are measurable at least on an ex post basis    Market  related risks are blessed with large quantities of data  so they are relatively  measurable  Credit  operational and other risks are somewhat rare events   Although  it is probably a good thing that such events are indeed rare their infrequency makes  measurement more difficult   Nonetheless  virtually any risk manager will attempt to  obtain at least a subjective sense of the expected frequency likelihood and cost of  these events   With either objective or subjective measurements in mind risk managers  can then proceed to modify these risks accordingly 
4,436,    Methods of Risk Modification
5,436,The notion of risk modification presumes that an analysis has been conducted in the  risk governance stage that defines how much risk is acceptable  Coupled with mea  surements of the actual risk  as discussed in the previous section the risk manager  then proceeds to align the actual risk with the acceptable risk   It is important to understand however that risk modification is not strictly risk  reduction  For example a portfolio with the strategic objective of maintaining a        split between equity and cash will naturally find that in a market in which cash  outperforms equity the split between equity and cash will tilt toward cash  Thus   the portfolio becomes less risky  Beyond a certain point  the risk of the portfolio is  unacceptably low given the return target   Thus  risk modification would take the form  of rebalancing by increasing the risk   For the most part  however risk management  focuses more on reducing the risk   Risk reduction is commonly referred to as hedging    A hedge is a transaction put in place to reduce risk   Some hedges are designed to  lead to the ultimate in risk reduction the complete elimination of risk   Others are  simply designed to lower the risk to an acceptable level    For some companies  risk  management is primarily concerned with keeping the organization solvent  Regardless  of the focus  much of what is done to manage risk is the same  In this section we will  examine four broad categories of risk modification  risk prevention and avoidance  risk acceptance risk transfer and risk shifting  
6,436,      Risk Prevention and Avoidance
7,436,One method of managing risk is taking steps to avoid it altogether but avoiding risk  may not be as simple as it appears   It is difficult to completely avoid risk  but more  importantly it is unclear that every risk should be completely avoided  Consider for  example the threat of a terrorist getting on a plane with a weapon  It might well be
8,436,   For example in the case of the portfolio with a strategic target of       equity and cash if equity  outperforms cash the portfolio will tilt toward equity  At some point  a risk  reducing strategy would then  be in order  This type of hedge would reduce the risk but not eliminate it

3,437,possible to completely eliminate this risk   We could subject ourselves to extensive  background checks  provide fingerprint and DNA samples  and permit complete  searches of our bodies and baggage at airports   Clearly there is a very high cost to  eliminating this risk in terms of money time and freedom  Instead we choose a trade  off  between cost and benefits   The actual trade  off may be subject to debate because risk  assessment and risk management are subject to variation from one person to another  We could nearly eliminate the risk of being injured or killed in an airplane crash if  we choose to never fly    Like any risk  avoidance strategy however there would more  than likely be a trade  off in terms of the loss of the benefits provided by the activity   We could try to protect our children from all harm but that may come at the expense  of preparing them poorly for adult life  We could invest our entire retirement savings  in cash but would most likely give up protection against inflation and lose out on  the opportunity to benefit from long  term economic growth and the performance of  investable assets that benefit from that growth  Insurance companies rely heavily on the techniques of risk prevention and avoid  ance  An automobile insurance company would prefer that their policyholders never  drive their cars   Although it cannot prohibit them from doing so it can reward them  with lower premiums if they drive less and have safe driving records   A life insurance  company would prefer that their policyholders do not smoke and it can reward non   smokers with lower rates   Nearly every risk we take has an upside at least as perceived by the person taking  the risk   Some counterexamples might seem to belie this point  but not if viewed from  the point of view of the risk taker  One could argue that there are no benefits from  smoking  but people who smoke may have the opinion that the pleasure they receive  exceeds the costs   Casino gambling incurs the risk of significant financial loss and  addiction but it is risk that is acceptable to the consumers who incur it relative to the  perceived benefits they receive  The risks of extreme sports  such as skydiving  would  seem to be exceeded by the benefits obtained by participants  and yet participants  engage in them with apparently much enjoyment   People undertake all types of risky  behaviors because they obtain commensurate benefits   These examples are simply  cases in which the decision maker chooses to bear a certain degree of risk   They are  conceptually the same as an investor who chooses to accept a relatively high degree  of risk   Likewise those who live their lives engaging in very few risky activities are  conceptually the same as the investor who keeps only a modest exposure to risky assets   In organizations  the decision to avoid risk is generally made at the governance  level as a part of setting the risk tolerance  Boards will often decide that there are some  business or investment activities simply not worth pursuing based on either the goals  of the organization or the perceived risk return trade  off  These are strategic decisions    Boards may exclude some areas or activities to allow management to focus on choos  ing risks in other areas where they presumably have a better chance of adding value  We recap this section by noting that risk prevention and avoidance is simply an  element of the decision of how much risk to accept  given the trade  off between the  risk of loss and the benefit of gain  This could be a direct benefit or an indirect benefit  of avoiding or eliminating a risk   Most decisions in life involve a trade  off between  benefits and costs  neither of which is necessarily easy to measure  Thus  risk man  agement is an ongoing process of fine  tuning exposure to achieve the level of risk that  is desired in relation to the benefits   In the event that the risk measurement process shows that the risk exceeds the  acceptable level there are three approaches to managing the risk   self  insuring  risk  transfer and risk shifting

3,438,      Risk Acceptance  Self  Insurance and Diversification
4,438,In many cases  from both a risk tolerance and a strategic standpoint  it makes sense to  keep a risk exposure but to do so in the most efficient manner possible  Self  insurance  is the notion of bearing a risk that is considered undesirable but too costly to elimi  nate by external means   In some cases  self  insuring means simply to bear the risk   In  other cases  it may involve the establishment of a reserve to cover losses   Choosing to  not have health insurance can be an optimal choice for some young  healthy adults  without responsibility for children  Setting aside some money to cover potential health  costs completes the picture of an individual who completely self  insures   Similarly a  young healthy individual who does not buy life insurance but engages in a systematic  well  conceived savings and investment plan is engaging in self  insurance  One must be careful with this approach however because there is a fine line  between self  insurance and denial  To the extent that self  insurance results in risks  that are completely in line with the enterprise s risk tolerance it would be an example  of good governance  But if there is a risk that is outside the enterprise s risk tolerance  and management decides to bear that risk anyway saying it is self  insuring  manage  ment is basically ignoring that risk  disregarding and violating its risk tolerance and  practicing bad risk governance  For example an investment management firm via its  risk tolerance decision may decide that it cannot bear any investment loss exceeding      billion and may apply a variety of risk management tools to limit its market and  credit risk accordingly  But suppose that the firm makes no move to limit or insure  its risks from fraud or a rogue trader on the grounds that it is  self  insuring  this risk   which could result in a loss as high as    billion  By leaving itself open to a loss that far  exceeds its stated risk tolerance management is violating the firm s risk governance  From the perspective of a business organization self  insurance is obtained by setting  aside sufficient capital to cover losses   The banking industry is a classic example of  self  insurance  Although in many countries government insurance may protect depos  itors  banks self  insure to some extent by maintaining capital and loan loss reserves   Another form of accepting risk  but doing so in the most efficient manner possible  is diversification  Technically it is a risk  mitigation technique  But diversification and   the efficient frontier  are so central to modern portfolio analysis that capturing the full  benefits of diversification seems the obvious thing for all organizations to pursue a  starting point at which other risk modification could be appended  Although diversi  fication is one form of risk management  it is usually not effective if used in isolation  In the next two subsections  we discuss how undesired risk can be modified or  eliminated by selling the risk to another party  We make two subtle classifications of  these methods   risk transfer and risk shifting  
5,438,      Risk Transfer
6,438,Risk transfer is the process of passing on a risk to another party often but not always   in the form of an insurance policy  Insurance is a legal contract in which one party  the insurer agrees to cover some percentage of a loss incurred by another party the  insured from a specific event in return for the payment of a premium by the insured   Insurance as a method of risk modification has been in existence for very long time  and in fact  is even mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi almost      years ago   Insurance has been widely used in the commercial shipping and farming industries  going back hundreds of years   Insurance is almost as old as commerce itself   
7,438,   It is worth noting that the insurance industry has for a long time referred to itself using the term  risk  management   A department of risk management in a large organization is often the group that manages the  organization s insurance policies   But since around      or so the term  risk management  has increasingly  come to refer to far more than insurance 
1,439,   
2,439,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,439,From the point of view of the insurer insurance almost always works on the basis  of diversification or pooling of risks   An insurer attempts to sell many policies with  risks that have low correlations   The insurer assesses the pooled risks and charges a  premium that covers the expected aggregate losses and the insurer  s operating costs  as well as leaves a profit   Insurers need accurate statistics on aggregate risks  but these  are often not difficult to obtain  These actuarial data are widely available on accidents   illnesses  property and casualty damage and death  In principle a well  diversified  insurer does not care if a single insured party has significantly larger  than  average  claims as long as there is no reason to believe that the claims are correlated  There  will be other parties that have smaller  than  average claims   Insurers do have to manage their risks carefully  Some risks can be correlated   In the US Gulf Coast region property insurance which includes coverage for loss  by hurricanes  is typically more expensive than property insurance in other regions    Even with a higher premium an insurer has to avoid providing too much property  coverage in an area where a systemic event  such as a hurricane can occur in order  to diversify its risk exposure  Although insurers carefully assess their risk and charge premiums that they believe  accurately reflect expected losses  they nonetheless remain responsible for potentially  large claims   Insurers also manage their risk by avoiding writing too many policies  with similar and potentially correlated risks and by selling some of the risk to another  insurer a practice known as reinsurance  A company that primarily insures property  in the US Midwest  which is highly subject to tornado risk  might be willing to accept  some Gulf Coast hurricane risk for a reasonable premium  Insurers often write pro  visions into contracts to exclude coverage of special cases   For example a war might  nullify insurance coverage in an area   Most insurance policies also contain provisions  to guard against moral hazards  such as suicide or destroying one s own property  In  the last    years or so some insurance companies have issued bonds that permit them  to legally avoid paying principal and or interest if insurance claims exceed a certain  amount   These instruments  known as catastrophe bonds  essentially pass some of  the insurance risk on to the investors who buy the bonds   Most insurance policies do not cover all of the risk that is insured  It is common  for policies to contain a provision known as a deductible  A deductible is a monetary  amount of the loss that will be covered by the insured before any claims are paid  Thus   both the insured and the insurer bear some of the risk  although the insurer usually  bears the greater amount   Deductibles serve several purposes   Because insurers incur  fixed costs for each claim deductibles reduce the number of small claims   Deductibles  also encourage good risk management by the insured parties   Finally deductibles offer  the insured the opportunity to combine risk transfer with self  insurance and thereby  achieve a potentially better trade  off of risk and reward  As noted the concept of insurance relies on the diversification or pooling of risks    In a few cases  however the risks are not easy to pool  For example suppose a volatile  but extremely successful actor is signed to star in a movie  The production company  knows that it runs the risk that the actor will engage in behavior that damages the  ability of the company to finish the movie  The number of volatile and extremely suc  cessful actors for whom policies could be written at the same time is somewhat limited   Thus  an insurer would have to bear that risk without the benefit of diversification  For example suppose a television network plans to cover the Olympics but is con  cerned about a possible cancellation or boycott   It might want an insurance policy to  cover it against loss   Specialized coverage is possible through such companies as Lloyd s  of London  The approximately      year old Lloyd s is famous for covering unusual  risks   It does so by organizing groups of investors who are willing to bear a risk for  a premium  These groups  called syndicates  are subject to the full extent of losses    In many cases  investors in these syndicates have been required to pay substantial
1,440,Measuring and Modifying Risks
2,440,   
3,440,amounts of money to cover losses     These examples illustrate how syndicates work    Although there is only one Olympics to insure there may also be only one actor to  insure  Because the two risks are uncorrelated a company could write policies on both  risks and would achieve some diversification  Moreover there are other unusual risks  that can be covered such that the aggregate pool would represent a highly diverse set  of risks that have low correlations     A very slight variation of insurance is a surety bond  With a surety bond an insurer  promises to pay an insured a certain amount of money if a third party fails to fulfill  its obligation  For example if a party engages the services of another party the first  party is covered if the party obligated to provide the service fails to perform to a sat  isfactory degree  Surety bonds are widely used in commercial activity when one party  bears the risk of the potentially high cost of non  performance by another party  A  slight variation of a surety bond is a fidelity bond which is often used to cover against  losses that result from employee dishonesty  Bonds of this type work very similarly to  insurance and rely on the pooling of uncorrelated risks     Other similar arrangements  include indemnity clauses and hold harmless arrangements  such as when two parties  sign a contract and one party agrees to hold the other harmless and or indemnify the  other in the event of loss   The use of insurance by so many as a risk management tool suggests that the cost  of risk exceeds the actuarial cost to many individuals and enterprises   Ex ante consid  eration of the cost of a risk in terms of the entity  s value or utility ties risk mitigation  back to the risk tolerance decision and the most fundamental governance decisions  on which value  added strategies to pursue  As an alternative to ignoring the cost of  risk  the impact on enterprise value should be quite positive 
4,440,      Risk Shifting
5,440,Whereas risk transfer refers to actions taken that pass the risk on to other parties  risk  shifting refers to actions that change the distribution of risk outcomes   Risk transfer is  often associated with insurance whereas risk shifting generally involves derivatives as  the risk modification vehicle  Although insurance is a form of risk management based  on the pooling or diversification of risks  risk shifting diverts some portion of the risk  distribution to another market participant who either bears the risk or intermediates  that risk by moving it to yet another party  The organization may want to adjust its  probability distribution of returns  essentially adjusting the payoff diagram of its risk  exposures   An example is a company that is willing to make slightly less profit than it  otherwise would if the stock market is up to prevent it from losing too much money  if the stock market is down for example more than     next year  It is adjusting its  potential economic outcomes by shifting the probability distribution of its profits  conditional on market performance  Risk shifting represents the bulk of hedging and  is the most common form of risk modification for financial organizations   The principal device through which risk shifting is performed is a derivative  We  briefly mentioned derivatives earlier in this reading   By definition a derivative is a  financial instrument that derives its price from the price of an underlying asset or  rate  Because the price of the underlying and the price of the derivative are so closely  related derivatives can provide essentially the same exposure as the underlying but
6,440,   NBC insured the      Summer Olympics in Moscow through Lloyd s of London to the extent that if a  US boycott occurred Lloyd s would pay NBC for losses that it incurred by prepaying the Soviet Union for  broadcasting rights   The United States did boycott the Olympics and NBC collected on its policy     There are insurance policies to cover singers  voices  athletes  bodies  and even such bizarre possibilities  as alien abductions and risks from paranormal activity     In the context of surety and fidelity bonds  the word  bond  does not mean a debt obligation issued  by one party the borrower and bought by another the lender  In this context  the word refers to assuring  one party that it bears no risk for the actions of a specific other party

3,441,can do so at lower cost and capital requirements   As such derivatives permit the effi  cient shifting of risk across the probability distribution and from one party to another   One can hold the underlying and take an offsetting position in the derivative or vice  versa   Whereas insurance can be designed to perform similarly insurance functions  primarily through the pooling of diverse risks   With derivatives  risks are shifted across  probability distributions or payoffs and across parties  to leave specific outcomes of  the conditional probability distribution with the parties most willing to bear the risk   There are several types of derivatives  and the manner in which they provide risk  shifting varies by type  Derivatives are classified into two categories   forward com  mitments or contingent claims   Forward commitments are agreements that obligate  two parties to undertake a transaction at a future date at a price or rate agreed on  when the commitment is made  Forward commitments include such instruments  as forward contracts  futures contracts  and swaps   Forward commitments can be  used to lock in a future interest rate for a borrower or lender the purchase or sale  price of an asset  or an exchange rate for a currency  Parties who engage in forward  commitments do not pay any money at the initiation of the contract   In lieu of any  up  front payment from one party to the other the two parties agree on the terms of  the transaction that will be consummated at the end of the contract   Depending on  movements in the price or rate of the underlying  one party will ultimately gain from  the transaction while the other will lose or in the less likely case both parties could  breakeven  For example a corporate treasurer can use a forward contract to lock in  the rate at which a foreign cash flow will be converted into the company  s domestic  currency  Regardless of movements in the exchange rate during the life of the contract  the foreign cash flow will convert to the domestic currency at a rate that is locked in  when the contract is initiated  On the opposite side of the transaction the party can  be a speculator who simply bears the risk or it can be a dealer who intermediates the  risk between the hedger and the speculator  We will discuss dealers in more detail in  a few paragraphs   The other type of derivative is a contingent claim which is commonly known  as an option  An option is a contract between two parties that gives one party the  right to buy or sell an underlying asset or to pay or receive a known underlying rate   An option takes the form of either a call option which provides the right to buy the  underlying or to pay a known rate or a put option which provides the right to sell  the underlying or to receive a known rate  With a forward commitment  both parties are mutually obligated to each other   Because an option grants the right  but not the obligation to one party that party has  an advantage over the other  Consequently that party the buyer of the option must  pay cash called the premium to the seller of the option at the start of the contract    Once the premium is paid the option buyer has no further obligation  He can either  exercise the option or he can let the option expire unexercised  In the latter case the  option buyer incurs a loss equal to the premium  If the option is a call and it is exer  cised the buyer pays the fixed price or rate and receives the underlying   If the option  is a put and it is exercised the buyer receives the fixed price or rate and delivers the  underlying     If the buyer of the option does exercise it  he may achieve a gain that  exceeds the premium paid but the gain could also be less than the premium paid  thereby resulting in a net overall loss   An option buyer could be using the option to  speculate on an upward move in the underlying if a call or downward move if a put    Alternatively the option buyer could be hedging   In the example used earlier for for  ward commitments  the corporate treasurer anticipating an inflow of cash in a foreign  currency could buy a put option to sell that currency thereby converting it into his

3,442,domestic cash flow at a known fixed rate  The option gives the treasurer the flexibility  to not exercise it if the underlying currency rises in value  This flexibility comes at  the cost of having to pay a premium at the start of the transaction thus shifting the  financial outcome across the entire probability distribution of that uncertain currency  rate  In contrast  with the forward contract  the treasurer does not have to pay cash  at the start but is obligated to convert at the agreed  upon rate  Derivatives can be created in public forums  such as on derivatives exchanges  or  privately between two parties   On derivatives exchanges  there are a large number  of individual and institutional traders that make markets in derivatives   For private  derivatives transactions  there is an extensive market of large bank and non  bank deal  ers willing to buy and sell derivatives   In both types of markets  these dealers assume  the risk being transferred from parties who originate the transactions   These dealers  almost always restructure and transfer some portion if not all of the risk by finding  other parties that are willing to take on that risk   Ultimately the risk is assumed by  some party willing to accept the risk  producing an economically efficient outcome  for all parties    
4,442,      How to Choose Which Method for Modifying Risk
5,442,Choosing which risk mitigation method to use risk prevention and avoidance  self  insuring  risk transfer or risk shifting is a critical part of the risk management  process   Fortunately the methods are not mutually exclusive and many organizations  use all methods to some extent  No single method provides a clear  cut advantage over  the others   As with all decisions  the trade  off is one of costs versus benefits that are  weighed in light of the risk tolerance of the organization or individual  For example many companies that have extensive foreign operations and are  therefore highly exposed to exchange rate risk  hedge that risk using derivatives    Some companies prefer forwards  some prefer swaps  some prefer options  and some  use multiple instruments   Some companies attempt to hedge currency risk by setting  up operations in foreign countries rather than manufacturing domestically and ship  ping the goods to foreign countries     Some companies manage their currency risk  by attempting to balance currency assets and liabilities   Some airlines hedge the risk  of oil price changes and others do not   Some airlines that do hedge this risk do so to  a far greater degree than others   Additionally some prefer the certainty of forwards  and swaps  whereas others prefer the flexibility of options  even with the up  front cost  that options require  Most insurance companies rely on their actuarial knowledge but  supplement it with proactive measures  such as selling risk to other parties   To the extent possible most organizations should avoid risks that provide few  benefits and potentially extreme costs   Reasonable low  cost precautions against  risks with few benefits should always be taken  Thus  risk prevention and avoidance  is probably the first choice of measures  especially for risks that lie outside the core  competencies of the organization and have little reasonable expectation of adding value 
6,442,   There is a potential exception to this statement   If the corporate treasurer wanting to lay off the foreign  currency risk could be matched with a counterparty with the exact opposite risk  the ultimate risk could  be extinguished  For example suppose the treasurer of a South Korean company anticipates the inflow of       million in exactly three months and expects on that day to convert that money into Korean won  If  there were another party who anticipated on that same day that it would take a certain amount of Korean  won and convert it to       million the two parties could offset their risk by trading with each other a  process called novation  Of course finding parties with the exact opposite needs is difficult  Dealers typically  parcel out risk  sometimes in pieces to various parties   Also through sophisticated modeling  dealers and  speculators can offset the risk with similar but not precisely balanced positions      Here is yet another example of the interactions of risks   A decision to manufacture products in a  foreign country involves trade  offs between exchange rate risk  political risk  and a variety of other risks  germane to that country  s economy not to mention a potentially different degree of operational risk  in  the pursuit of higher profits  
1,443,   
2,443,Reading      Risk Management  An Introduction
3,443,Nonetheless  avoidance may not be the best value for its cost   Moreover avoiding risk  may mean avoiding opportunity  Thus  an organization often cannot simply decide  not to take a risk  at least not for all undesirable risks   Organizations that have large amounts of free cash flow may choose to self  insure  some risks  but few organizations have so much cash that they can afford to self  insure  all risks   Some risks can potentially imperil the entire capital base  Most companies  would however prefer to self  insure to the extent possible because self  insurance  reduces the costs associated with external monitoring and gives the organization the  greatest flexibility  Self  insurance and avoidance should generally be clearly addressed  at the governance level and be consistent with stated risk tolerance  Risk transfer or the use of insurance is a widely used risk management tactic but  it may not be suitable for many types of risks   Some risks simply are not insurable at  least not in a cost  effective way  Insurance works best when risks can be pooled and  that is not the case for many types of risks  particularly those that can affect a large  number of parties at the same time  The use of risk shifting tools  such as derivatives   may not be available for all types of risks  thus limiting their use in risk mitigation   For financial risks that exceed risk appetite risk shifting is a very common choice  The various risk management methods are not equal in terms of the risk reduction  and the risk profile that remains   For example contingent claims  such as insurance  provide the flexibility in the form of offering opportunity to profit in one direction  and have a loss reduced in the other but they require payment of cash up front   In  contrast forward commitments lock in an outcome  In other words  they provide little  flexibility but they require no cash payment up front   The risk profile that exists when  a contingent claim hedge is put in place differs significantly from the risk profile that  exists when a forward commitment hedge is placed  This process requires significant  understanding and discussion at all levels of the organization  To recap risk takers should identify risks that offer few rewards in light of poten  tial costs and avoid those risks when possible  They should self  insure where it makes  sense and diversify to the extent possible  They should consider insurance when risks  can be pooled effectively if the cost of the insurance is less than the expected benefit    If derivatives are used they must consider the trade  off of locking in outcomes with  forward commitments versus the flexibility relative to cash cost of contingent claims   which can tailor the desired outcomes or payoffs by shifting the risk   Ultimately the  decision is always one of balancing costs against benefits while producing a risk profile  that is consistent with the risk management objectives of the organization

5,453,WHAT IS FINTECH 
6,453,In its broadest sense the term  fintech  generally refers to technology  driven innovation  occurring in the financial services industry  For the purposes of this reading  fintech  refers to technological innovation in the design and delivery of financial services and  products   Note however that in common usage fintech can also refer to companies   often new startup companies  involved in developing the new technologies and their  applications  as well as the business sector that comprises such companies   Many  of these innovations are challenging the traditional business models of incumbent  financial services providers   Early forms of fintech included data processing and the automation of routine tasks    Then followed systems that provided execution of decisions according to specified  rules and instructions   Fintech has since advanced into decision  making applications  based on complex machine  learning logic where computer programs are able to   learn  how to complete tasks over time  In some applications  advanced computer  systems are performing tasks at levels far surpassing human capabilities   Fintech has  changed the financial services industry in many ways  giving rise to new systems for  investment advice financial planning  business lending  and payments   Whereas fintech covers a broad range of services and applications  areas of fintech  development that are more directly relevant to the investment industry include the  following     Analysis of large datasets  In addition to growing amounts of traditional data   such as security prices  corporate financial statements  and economic indica  tors  massive amounts of alternative data generated from non  traditional data  sources  such as social media and sensor networks  can now be integrated into  a portfolio manager  s investment decision  making process and used to help  generate alpha and reduce losses      Analytical tools  For extremely large datasets  techniques involving artificial  intelligence  AI  computer systems capable of performing tasks that previ  ously required human intelligence may be better suited to identify complex   non  linear relationships than traditional quantitative methods and statistical  analysis   Advances in AI  based techniques are enabling different data analysis  approaches   For example analysts are turning to artificial intelligence to sort  through the enormous amounts of data from company filings  annual reports   and earnings calls to determine which data are most important and to help  uncover trends and generate insights relating to human sentiment and behavior     Automated trading   Executing investment decisions through computer algo  rithms or automated trading applications may provide a number of benefits to  investors  including more efficient trading  lower transaction costs  anonymity  and greater access to market liquidity

12,457,    Big Data Challenges
13,457,Big Data poses several challenges when it is used in investment analysis  including  the quality volume and appropriateness of the data   Key issues revolve around the  following questions  among others   Does the dataset have selection bias  missing  data  or data outliers  Is the volume of collected data sufficient  Is the dataset well  suited for the type of analysis  In most instances  the data must be sourced cleansed  and organized before analysis can occur  This process can be extremely difficult with  alternative data owing to the unstructured characteristics of the data involved which  are more often qualitative  e g   texts  photos  and videos  than quantitative in nature  Given the size and complexity of alternative datasets  traditional analytical meth  ods cannot always be used to interpret and evaluate these datasets   To address this  challenge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have emerged that  support work on such large and complex sources of information

3,458,other areas   Since the     s  financial institutions have made use of AI particularly  neural networks programming based on how our brain learns and processes infor  mation to detect abnormal charges or claims in credit card fraud detection systems   Machine learning  ML  is a technology that has grown out of the wider AI field   ML algorithms are computer programs that are able to  learn  how to complete tasks   improving their performance over time with experience  As it is currently used in the  investing context  ML requires massive amounts of data for  training   so although  some ML techniques have existed for years  insufficient data have historically limited  broader application  Previously these algorithms lacked access to the large amounts of  data needed to model relationships successfully  The growth in Big Data has provided  ML algorithms  such as neural networks  with sufficient data to improve modeling  and predictive accuracy and greater use of ML techniques is now possible  In ML  the computer algorithm is given  inputs   a set of variables or datasets   and may be given  outputs   the target data   The algorithm  learns  from the data  provided how best to model inputs to outputs  if provided  or how to identify or  describe underlying data structure if no outputs are given  Training occurs as the  algorithm identifies relationships in the data and uses that information to refine its  learning process   ML involves splitting the dataset into a training dataset and validation dataset   evaluation dataset   The training dataset allows the algorithm to identify relationships  between inputs and outputs based on historical patterns in the data   These relation  ships are then tested on the validation dataset   Once an algorithm has mastered the  training and validation datasets  the ML model can be used to predict outcomes based  on other datasets   ML still requires human judgement in understanding the underlying data and  selecting the appropriate techniques for data analysis   Before they can be used the  data must be clean and free of biases and spurious data   As noted ML models also  require sufficiently large amounts of data and may not perform well where there may  not be enough available data to train and validate the model  Analysts must also be cognizant of errors that may arise from overfitting the  data  because models that overfit the data may discover  false  relationships or   unsubstantiated  patterns that will lead to prediction errors and incorrect output  forecasts   Overfitting occurs when the ML model learns the input and target dataset  too precisely  In such cases  the model has been  over  trained  on the data and treats  noise in the data as true parameters   An ML model that has been overfitted is not  able to accurately predict outcomes using a different dataset and may be too complex    When a model has been underfitted the ML model treats true parameters as if they  are noise and is not able to recognize relationships within the training data   In such  cases  the model may be too simplistic  Underfitted models will typically fail to fully  discover patterns that underlie the data   In addition since they are not explicitly programmed ML techniques can appear  to be opaque or  black box  approaches  which arrive at outcomes that may not be  entirely understood or explainable 
4,458,    Types of Machine Learning
5,458,ML approaches can help identify relationships between variables  detect patterns or  trends  and create structure from data  including data classification  The main types  of machine learning approaches include supervised and unsupervised learning   In supervised learning computers learn to model relationships based on labeled  training data   In supervised learning  inputs and outputs are labeled or identified  for the algorithm  After learning how best to model relationships for the labeled  data  the trained algorithms are used to model or predict outcomes for new datasets    Trying to identify the best signal or variable to forecast future returns on a stock or

3,459,trying to predict whether local stock market performance will be up down or flat  during the next business day are problems that may be approached using supervised  learning techniques   In unsupervised learning computers are not given labeled data but instead are  given only data from which the algorithm seeks to describe the data and their struc  ture  Trying to group companies into peer groups based on their characteristics rather  than using standard sector or country groupings is a problem that may be approached  using unsupervised learning techniques   Underlying AI advances have been key developments relating to neural networks    In deep learning  or deep learning nets  computers use neural networks  often with  many hidden layers  to perform multistage non  linear data processing to identify pat  terns   Deep learning may use supervised or unsupervised machine learning approaches    By taking a layered or multistage approach to data analysis  deep learning develops an  understanding of simple concepts that informs analysis of more complex concepts    Neural networks have existed since      and have been used for many applications   such as forecasting and pattern recognition since the early     s   Improvements in the  algorithms underlying neural networks are providing more accurate models that better  incorporate and learn from data   As a result  these algorithms are now far better at  such activities as image pattern and speech recognition  In many cases  the advanced  algorithms require less computing power than the earlier neural networks  and their  improved solution enables analysts to discover insights and identify relationships that  were previously too difficult or too time consuming to uncover

6,459,The ability to analyze Big Data using ML techniques  alongside more traditional  statistical methods  represents a significant development in investment research  supported by the presence of greater data availability and advances in the algorithms  themselves   Improvements in computing power and software processing speeds and  falling storage costs have further supported this evolution  ML techniques are being used for Big Data analysis to help predict trends or mar  ket events  such as the likelihood of a successful merger or an outcome to a political  election  Image recognition algorithms can now analyze data from satellite  imaging  systems to provide intelligence on the number of consumers in retail store parking  lots  shipping activity and manufacturing facilities  and yields on agricultural crops   to name just a few examples   Such information may provide insights into individual firms or at national or global  levels and may be used as inputs into valuation or economic models

4,465,   Fully Automated Digital Wealth Managers
5,465,The fully automated model does not rely on assistance from a human finan  cial adviser  These services seek to offer a low  cost solution to investing and  recommend an investment portfolio which is often composed of ETFs   The  service package may include direct deposits  periodic rebalancing  and dividend  reinvestment options  
6,465,   Adviser  Assisted Digital Wealth Managers
7,465,Adviser  assisted digital wealth managers provide automated investment services  along with a virtual financial adviser who is available to offer basic financial  planning advice and periodic reviews by phone  Adviser  assisted digital wealth  managers are capable of providing additional services that may involve a more  holistic analysis of a client s assets and liabilities   Wealthy and ultra  wealthy individuals typically have had access to human advisory  teams  but there has been a gap in the availability and quality of advisers to serve  investors with less wealth  The advent of robo  advisers offers a cost  effective and  easily accessible form of financial guidance  In following a typically passive investment  approach research suggests that robo  advisers tend to offer fairly conservative advice  However critics of robo  advisers have wondered what would happen in a time of  crisis  when people most often look to human expertise for guidance  It may not always  be completely transparent why a robo  adviser chooses to make a recommendation or  take a trading action that it did unlike a human adviser who can provide his or her  rationale  And finally there may be trust issues in allowing computers to make these  decisions  including worries of instances where robo  advisers might recommend  inappropriate investments   As the complexity and size of an investor  s portfolio grows  robo  advisers may not  be able to sufficiently address the particular preferences and needs of the investor  In  the case of extremely affluent investors who may own a greater number of asset types  including alternative investments  e g   venture capital private equity hedge funds   and real estate  in addition to global stocks and bonds and have greater demands  for customization the need for a team of human advisers  each with particular areas  of investment or wealth  management expertise is likely to endure 
8,465,    Risk Analysis

4,466,    Algorithmic Trading
5,466,Algorithmic trading is the computerized buying and selling of financial instruments   in accordance with pre  specified rules and guidelines   Algorithmic trading is often  used to execute large institutional orders  slicing orders into smaller pieces and exe  cuting across different exchanges and trading venues   Algorithmic trading provides  investors with many benefits  including speed of execution anonymity and lower  transaction costs   Over the course of a day algorithms may continuously update and  revise their execution strategy on the basis of changing prices  volumes  and market  volatility  Algorithms may also determine the best way to price the order  e g   limit  or market order  and the most appropriate trading venue  e g   exchange or dark pool   to route for execution  High  frequency trading  HFT  is a form of algorithmic trading that makes use  of vast quantities of granular financial data  tick data  for example  to automatically  place trades when certain conditions are met  Trades are executed on ultra  high  speed  low  latency networks in fractions of a second  HFT algorithms decide what to buy  or sell and where to execute on the basis of real  time prices and market conditions   seeking to earn a profit from intraday market mispricings   Global financial markets have undergone substantial change as markets have frag  mented into multiple trading destinations consisting of electronic exchanges  alter  native trading systems  and so  called dark pools  and average trade sizes have fallen   In this environment  and with markets continuously reflecting real  time information  algorithmic trading has been viewed as an important tool 
6,466,DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY

2,467,Reading      Fintech in Investment Management
3,467,technology is not fully secure and breaches in privacy and data protection are pos  sible  In addition the processes underlying DLT generally require massive amounts  of energy to verify transaction activity  A distributed ledger is a type of database that may be shared among entities  in a network   In a distributed ledger entries are recorded stored and distributed  across a network of participants so that each participant has a matching copy of the  digital database  Basic elements of a DLT network include a digital ledger a consensus  mechanism used to confirm new entries  and a participant network   The consensus mechanism is the process by which the computer entities  or nodes   in a network agree on a common state of the ledger  Consensus generally involves  two steps   transaction validation and agreement on ledger update by network parties    These features enable the creation of records that are for the most part  considered  immutable or unchangeable yet they are transparent and accessible to network par  ticipants on a near  real  time basis   Features of DLT include the use of cryptography an algorithmic process to  encrypt data  making the data unusable if received by unauthorized parties which  enables a high level of network security and database integrity  For example DLT  uses cryptographic methods of proof to verify network participant identity and for  data encryption  DLT has the potential to accommodate  smart contracts  which are computer  programs that self  execute on the basis of pre  specified terms and conditions agreed  to by the parties to a contract   Examples of smart contract use are the automatic exe  cution of contingent claims for derivatives and the instantaneous transfer of collateral  in the event of default   Exhibit   illustrates a distributed ledger network in which all nodes are connected  to one another each having a copy of the distributed ledger  The term  Consensus   is shown in the center of the network and represents the consensus mechanism in  which the nodes agree on new transactions and ledger updates

32,467,Blockchain is a type of digital ledger in which information such as changes in  ownership is recorded sequentially within blocks that are then linked or  chained   together and secured using cryptographic methods   Each block contains a grouping  of transactions  or entries  and a secure link  known as a hash  to the previous block  
1,468,Distributed Ledger Technology
2,468,   
3,468,New transactions are inserted into the chain only after validation via a consensus  mechanism in which authorized members agree on the transaction and the preceding  order or history in which previous transactions have occurred  The consensus mechanism used to verify a transaction includes a cryptographic  problem that must be solved by some computers on the network  known as miners   each time a transaction takes place  The process to update the blockchain can require  substantial amounts of computing power making it very difficult and extremely  expensive for an individual third party to manipulate historical data   To manipulate  historical data  an individual or entity would have to control the majority of nodes in the  network   The success of the network  therefore relies on broad network participation 
4,468,Blockchain  Distributed Ledger  Network How Do  Transactions Get Added 
5,468,Outlined below are the steps involved in adding a transaction to a blockchain distrib   uted ledger    Transaction takes place between buyer and seller   Transaction is broadcast to the network of computers  nodes    Nodes validate the transaction details and par ties to the transaction   Once verified the transaction is combined with other transactions to form a new  block  of predetermined size  of data for the ledger   This block of data is then added or linked  using a cryptographic process  to the  previous block s  containing data   Transaction is considered complete and ledger has been updated
6,468,    Permissioned and Permissionless Networks
7,468,DLT can take the form of permissionless or permissioned networks   Permissionless  networks are open to any user who wishes to make a transaction and all users within  the network can see all transactions that exist on the blockchain  In a permissionless   or open DLT system network participants can perform all network functions   The main benefit of a permissionless network is that it does not depend on a cen  tralized authority to confirm or deny the validity of transactions  because this takes  place through the consensus mechanism  This means no single point of failure exists   since all transactions are recorded on a single distributed database and every node  stores a copy of the database  Once a transaction has been added to the blockchain it  cannot be changed barring manipulation  the distributed ledger becomes a permanent  and immutable record of all previous transactions   In a permissionless network  trust  is not a requirement between transacting parties   A well  known example of an open permissionless network is bitcoin  Using  blockchain technology Bitcoin was created in      to serve as the public ledger for  all transactions occurring on its virtual currency  Since the introduction of bitcoin  many more cryptocurrencies  or digital currencies  which use permissionless DLT  networks  have been created  In permissioned networks network members may be restricted from participating  in certain network activities   Controls  or permissions  may be used to allow varying  levels of access to the ledger from adding transactions  e g   a participant  to viewing  transactions only  e g   a regulator  to viewing selective details of the transactions but  not the full record

3,469,    Applications of Distributed Ledger Technology to  Investment Management
4,469,Potential applications of DLT to investment management include cryptocurrencies   tokenization post  trade clearing and settlement  and compliance 
5,469,      Cryptocurrencies
6,469,A cryptocurrency also known as a digital currency operates as electronic currency and  allows near  real  time transactions between parties without the need for an intermedi  ary such as a bank   As electronic mediums of exchange cryptocurrencies lack physical  form and are issued privately by individuals  companies  and other organizations   Most  issued cryptocurrencies utilize open DLT systems in which a decentralized distributed  ledger is used to record and verify all digital currency transactions   Cryptocurrencies  have not traditionally been government backed or regulated  Central banks around  the world however are recognizing potential benefits and examining use cases for  their own cryptocurrency versions   Many cryptocurrencies have a self  imposed limit on the total amount of currency  they may issue  Although such limits could help maintain their store of value it is  important to note that many cryptocurrencies have experienced high levels of price  volatility  A lack of clear fundamentals underlying these currencies has contributed  to their volatility  Cryptocurrencies have proven to be an attractive means for companies looking to  raise capital  An initial coin offering  ICO  is an unregulated process whereby com  panies sell their crypto tokens to investors in exchange for fiat money or for another  agreed upon cryptocurrency  An ICO is typically structured to issue digital tokens to  investors that can be used to purchase future products or services being developed  by the issuer  ICOs provide an alternative to traditional regulated capital  raising pro  cesses  such as initial public offerings  IPOs   Compared to the regulated IPO market   ICOs may have lower associated issuance costs and shorter capital raising time frames    However most ICOs do not typically have attached voting rights   Regulation for ICOs  is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions  and there have been numerous  instances of investor loss resulting from fraudulent schemes  
7,469,      Tokenization
8,469,Transactions involving physical assets  such as real estate luxury goods  and com  modities  often require substantial efforts in ownership verification and examination  each time a transfer in ownership takes place  Through tokenization the process of  representing ownership rights to physical assets on a blockchain or distributed ledger  DLT has the potential to streamline this process by creating a single digital record of  ownership with which to verify ownership title and authenticity including all historical  activity  Real estate transactions that require ownership and identify verification may  be one area to benefit from tokenization because these transactions are typically labor  intensive and costly involving decentralized paper  based records and multiple parties  
9,469,      Post  Trade Clearing and Settlement
10,469,In the financial securities markets  post  trade processes to confirm clear and settle  transactions are often complex and labor intensive requiring multiple interactions  between counterparties and financial intermediaries   DLT has the ability to streamline  existing post  trade processes by providing near  real  time trade verification recon  ciliation and settlement  thereby reducing the complexity time and costs associated  with processing transactions   A single distributed record of ownership between net  work peers would eliminate the need for independent and duplicative reconciliation  efforts between parties and reduce the need for third  party facilitation  A shortened

4,470,      Compliance
5,470,Regulators worldwide have imposed more stringent reporting requirements and  demand greater transparency and access to data   To meet these requirements  many  firms have added staff to their post  trade and compliance groups   But these functions  remain predominantly manual  To comply with regulations  firms need to maintain  and process large amounts of risk  related data   DLT may allow regulators and firms  to maintain near  real  time review over transactions and other compliance  related  processes   Improved post  trade reconciliation and automation through DLT could  lead to more accurate record keeping and create operational efficiencies for a firm s  compliance and regulatory reporting processes  while providing greater transparency  and auditability for external authorities and regulators   DLT  based compliance may better support shared information communications   and transparency within and between firms  exchanges  custodians  and regulators    Closed or permissioned networks could offer advantages in security and privacy   These platforms could store highly sensitive information in a way that is secure but  easily accessible to internal and external authorities   DLT could help uncover fraud  ulent activity and reduce compliance costs associated with know  your  customer and  anti  money  laundering regulations  which entail verifying the identity of clients and  business partners  
6,470,DLT Challenges
7,470,A number of challenges exist before DLT may be successfully adopted by the investment  industry  These include the following 
8,470,   There is a lack of DLT network standardization as well as difficulty integrating with  legacy systems     DLT processing capabilities may not be financially competitive with existing  solutions     Increasing the scale of DLT systems requires substantial  storage  resources     Immutability of transactions means accidental or  canceled  trades can be undone  only by submitting an equal and offsetting trade     DLT requires huge amounts of computer power normally associated with high  electricity usage     regulatory approaches may differ by jurisdiction
