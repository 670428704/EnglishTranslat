2,11,CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
3,11,The CFA Program is grounded in the practice of the investment profession  Beginning with the  Global Body of Investment Knowledge  GBIK  CFA Institute performs a continuous practice  analysis with investment professionals around the world to determine the competencies that are  relevant to the profession  Regional expert panels and targeted surveys are conducted annually  to verify and reinforce the continuous feedback from the GBIK collaborative website  The  practice analysis process ultimately defines the CBOK  The CBOK reflects the competencies  that are generally accepted and applied by investment professionals  These competencies are  used in practice in a generalist context and are expected to be demonstrated by a recently  qualified CFA charterholder 
4,11,The Education Advisory Committee consisting of practicing charterholders in conjunction  with CFA Institute staff designs the CFA Program curriculum in order to deliver the CBOK to  candidates  The examinations also written by charterholders are designed to allow you to  demonstrate your mastery of the CBOK as set forth in the CFA Program curriculum  As you  structure your personal study program you should emphasize mastery of the CBOK and the  practical application of that knowledge  For more information on the practice analysis CBOK  and development of the CFA Program curriculum please visit www cfainstitute org 
5,11,ORGANIZATION OF THE CURRICULUM
6,11,The Level I CFA Program curriculum is organized into    topic areas  Each topic area begins  with a brief statement of the material and the depth of knowledge expected 
7,11,Each topic area is then divided into one or more study sessions  These study sessions     sessions in the Level I curriculum should form the basic structure of your reading and  preparation

2,12,The entire readings including the practice problems at the end of the readings are the basis for  all examination questions and are selected or developed specifically to teach the knowledge and  skills reflected in the CBOK 
3,12,You should use the LOS to guide and focus your study because each examination question is  based on one or more LOS and the core material and practice problems associated with the  LOS  As a candidate you are responsible for the entirety of the required material in a study  session 
4,12,We encourage you to review the information about the LOS on our website

8,12,FEATURES OF THE CURRICULUM
9,12,Begin optional segment
10,12,Required vs  Optional Segments
11,12,You should read all of an assigned reading  In some cases though we have reprinted an entire  chapter or article and marked certain parts of the reading as  optional   The CFA examination is  based only on the required segments and the optional segments are included only when it is  determined that they might help you to better understand the required segments  by seeing the  required material in its full context   When an optional segment begins you will see an icon and  a dashed vertical bar in the outside margin that will continue until the optional segment ends  accompanied by another icon  Unless the material is specifically marked as optional you  should assume it is required  You should rely on the required segments and the reading specific  LOS in preparing for the examination 
12,12,End optional segment
13,12,Practice Problems Solutions
14,12,All practice problems at the end of the readings as well as their solutions are part of the  curriculum and are required material for the exam  In addition to the in text examples and  questions these practice problems should help demonstrate practical applications and reinforce  your understanding of the concepts presented  Many of these practice problems are adapted  from past CFA examinations and or may serve as a basis for exam questions 
15,12,Glossary and Index
16,12,For your convenience we have printed a comprehensive glossary in each volume  Throughout  the curriculum a bolded word in a reading denotes a term defined in the glossary  The  curriculum eBook is searchable but we also publish an index that can be found on the CFA  Institute website with the Level I study sessions

2,13,LOS Self Check
3,13,We have inserted checkboxes next to each LOS that you can use to track your progress in  mastering the concepts in each reading 
4,13,Source Material
5,13,The authorship publisher and copyright owners are given for each reading for your reference   We recommend that you use the CFA Institute curriculum rather than the original source  materials because the curriculum may include only selected pages from outside readings  updated sections within the readings and problems and solutions tailored to the CFA Program   Note that some readings may contain a web address or URL  The referenced sites were live at  the time the reading was written but may have been deactivated since then 
6,13,Some readings in the curriculum cite articles published in the Financial Analysts  Journal  which is the flagship publication of CFA Institute  Since its launch in       the Financial Analysts Journal has established itself as the leading practitioner oriented  journal in the investment management community  Over the years it has advanced the  knowledge and understanding of the practice of investment management through the  publication of peer reviewed practitioner relevant research from leading academics and  practitioners  It has also featured thought provoking opinion pieces that advance the  common level of discourse within the investment management profession  Some of the  most influential research in the area of investment management has appeared in the  pages of the Financial Analysts Journal and    Nobel laureates have contributed more  than    articles 
7,13,Candidates are not responsible for familiarity with Financial Analysts Journal articles  that are cited in the curriculum  But as your time and studies allow we strongly  encourage you to begin supplementing your understanding of key investment  management issues by reading this practice oriented publication  Candidates have full  online access to the Financial Analysts Journal and associated resources  All you need  is to log in on www cfapubs org using your candidate credentials

2,14,Create a Schedule
3,14,An orderly systematic approach to exam preparation is critical  You should dedicate a  consistent block of time every week to reading and studying  Complete all reading assignments  and the associated problems and solutions in each study session  Review the LOS both before  and after you study each reading to ensure that you have mastered the applicable content and  can demonstrate the knowledge and skills described by the LOS and the assigned reading  Use  the LOS self check to track your progress and highlight areas of weakness for later review 
4,14,As you prepare for your exam we will e mail you important exam updates testing policies and  study tips  Be sure to read these carefully  Curriculum errata are periodically updated and  posted on the study session page at www cfainstitute org 
5,14,Successful candidates report an average of more than     hours preparing for each exam  Your  preparation time will vary based on your prior education and experience and you will probably  spend more time on some study sessions than on others  As the Level I curriculum includes     study sessions a good plan is to devote       hours per week for    weeks to studying the  material and use the final four to six weeks before the exam to review what you have learned  and practice with practice questions and mock exams  This recommendation however may  underestimate the hours needed for appropriate examination preparation depending on your  individual circumstances relevant experience and academic background  You will undoubtedly  adjust your study time to conform to your own strengths and weaknesses and to your  educational and professional background 
6,14,You should allow ample time for both in depth study of all topic areas and additional  concentration on those topic areas for which you feel the least prepared 
7,14,An interactive study planner is provided along with your practice questions and mock exams to  help you plan your study time  The interactive study planner calculates your study progress and  pace based on the time remaining until examination 
8,14,CFA Institute Practice Questions
9,14,The CFA Institute practice question sets are intended to assess your mastery of individual topic  areas as you progress through your studies  After each practice question set you will receive  immediate feedback noting the correct responses and indicating the relevant assigned reading so  you can identify areas of weakness for further study  For more information on the practice  question sets please visit www cfainstitute org 
10,14,CFA Institute Mock Exams
11,14,The three hour mock exams simulate the morning and afternoon sessions of the actual CFA  examination and are intended to be taken after you complete your study of the full curriculum  so you can test your understanding of the curriculum and your readiness for the exam  You will  receive feedback at the end of the mock exam noting the correct responses and indicating the  relevant assigned readings so you can assess areas of weakness for further study during your  review period  We recommend that you take mock exams during the final stages of your  preparation for the actual CFA examination  For more information on the mock examinations

2,21,Financial analysis is the process of examining a company s performance in the context of its industry and  economic environment in order to arrive at a decision or recommendation  Often the decisions and  recommendations addressed by financial analysts pertain to providing capital to companies specifically  whether to invest in the company s debt or equity securities and at what price  An investor in debt  securities is concerned about the company s ability to pay interest and to repay the principal lent  An  investor in equity securities is an owner with a residual interest in the company and is concerned about the  company s ability to pay dividends and the likelihood that its share price will increase  Overall a central  focus of financial analysis is evaluating the company s ability to earn a return on its capital that is at least  equal to the cost of that capital to profitably grow its operations and to generate enough cash to meet  obligations and pursue opportunities  Fundamental financial analysis starts with the information found in  a company s financial reports  These financial reports include audited financial statements additional  disclosures required by regulatory authorities and any accompanying  unaudited  commentary by  management  Basic financial statement analysis as presented in this reading provides a foundation that  enables the analyst to better understand information gathered from research beyond the financial reports 
3,21,This reading is organized as follows  Section   discusses the scope of financial statement analysis   Section   describes the sources of information used in financial statement analysis including the primary  financial statements  statement of financial position or balance sheet statement of comprehensive income  statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement   Section   provides a framework for guiding the  financial statement analysis process  A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA  Institute multiple choice format conclude the reading 
4,21,   SCOPE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS
5,21,The role of financial reporting by companies is to provide information about a company s performance  financial position and changes in financial position that is useful to a wide range of users in making  economic decisions   The role of financial statement analysis is to use financial reports prepared by  companies combined with other information to evaluate the past current and potential performance and  financial position of a company for the purpose of making investment credit and other economic  decisions   Managers within a company perform financial analysis to make operating investing and  financing decisions but do not necessarily rely on analysis of related financial statements  They have  access to additional financial information that can be reported in whatever format is most useful to their  decision  
6,21,In evaluating financial reports analysts typically have a specific economic decision in mind  Examples of  these decisions include the following 
7,21,  Evaluating an equity investment for inclusion in a portfolio 
8,21,  Evaluating a merger or acquisition candidate 
9,21,  Evaluating a subsidiary or operating division of a parent company 
10,21,  Deciding whether to make a venture capital or other private equity investment 
11,21,  Determining the creditworthiness of a company in order to decide whether to extend a loan to the  company and if so what terms to offer 
12,21,  Extending credit to a customer 
13,21,  Examining compliance with debt covenants or other contractual arrangements 
14,21,  Assigning a debt rating to a company or bond issue

2,22,  Valuing a security for making an investment recommendation to others 
3,22,  Forecasting future net income and cash flow 
4,22,These decisions demonstrate certain themes in financial analysis  In general analysts seek to examine the  past and current performance and financial position of a company in order to form expectations about its  future performance and financial position  Analysts are also concerned about factors that affect risks to a  company s future performance and financial position  An examination of performance can include an  assessment of a company s profitability  the ability to earn a profit from delivering goods and services   and its ability to generate positive cash flows  cash receipts in excess of cash disbursements   Profit and  cash flow are not equivalent  Profit  or loss  represents the difference between the prices at which goods  or services are provided to customers and the expenses incurred to provide those goods and services  In  addition profit  or loss  includes other income  such as investing income or income from the sale of items  other than goods and services  minus the expenses incurred to earn that income  Overall profit  or loss   equals income minus expenses and its recognition is mostly independent from when cash is received or  paid  Example   illustrates the distinction between profit and cash flow 
5,22,EXAMPLE  
6,22,Profit versus Cash Flow
7,22,Sennett Designs  SD  sells furniture on a retail basis  SD began operations during December       and sold furniture for         in cash  The furniture sold by SD was purchased on credit for          and delivered by the supplier during December  The credit terms granted by the supplier  required SD to pay the         in January for the furniture it received during December  In  addition to the purchase and sale of furniture in December SD paid        in cash for rent and  salaries 
8,22,   How much is SD s profit for December      if no other transactions occurred 
9,22,   How much is SD s cash flow for December      
10,22,   If SD purchases and sells exactly the same amount in January      as it did in December  and under the same terms  receiving cash for the sales and making purchases on credit that  will be due in February  how much will the company s profit and cash flow be for the  month of January 
11,22,Solution to   
12,22,SD s profit for December      is the excess of the sales price           over the cost of the  goods that were sold           and rent and salaries          or        
13,22,Solution to   
14,22,The December      cash flow is         the amount of cash received from the customer            less the cash paid for rent and salaries          
15,22,Solution to   
16,22,SD s profit for January      will be identical to its profit in December         calculated as the  sales price           minus the cost of the goods that were sold           and minus rent and  salaries           SD s cash flow in January      will also equal        calculated as the  amount of cash received from the customer           minus the cash paid for rent and salaries           and minus the         that SD owes for the goods it had purchased on credit in the  prior month

2,23,Although profitability is important so is a company s ability to generate positive cash flow  Cash flow is  important because ultimately the company needs cash to pay employees suppliers and others in order to  continue as a going concern  A company that generates positive cash flow from operations has more  flexibility in funding needed for investments and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities  than an otherwise comparable company without positive operating cash flow  Additionally a company  needs cash to pay returns  interest and dividends  to providers of debt and equity capital  Therefore the  expected magnitude of future cash flows is important in valuing corporate securities and in determining  the company s ability to meet its obligations  The ability to meet short term obligations is generally  referred to as liquidity and the ability to meet long term obligations is generally referred to as solvency   Cash flow in any given period is not however a complete measure of performance for that period  because as shown in Example   a company may be obligated to make future cash payments as a result  of a transaction that generates positive cash flow in the current period 
3,23,Profits may provide useful information about cash flows past and future  If the transaction of Example   were repeated month after month the long term average monthly cash flow of SD would equal         its monthly profit  Analysts typically not only evaluate past profitability but also forecast future  profitability 
4,23,Exhibit   shows how news coverage of corporate earnings announcements places corporate results in the  context of analysts  expectations  Panel A shows the earnings announcement and Panel B shows a sample  of the news coverage of the announcement  Earnings are also frequently used by analysts in valuation  For  example an analyst may value shares of a company by comparing its price to earnings ratio  P E  to the  P Es of peer companies and or may use forecasted future earnings as direct or indirect inputs into  discounted cash flow models of valuation

2,26,In conducting a financial analysis of a company the analyst will regularly refer to the company s  financial statements financial notes and supplementary schedules and a variety of other information  sources  The next section introduces the major financial statements and some commonly used information  sources 
3,26,   MAJOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER  INFORMATION SOURCES
4,26,In order to perform an equity or credit analysis of a company an analyst collects a great deal of  information  The nature of the information collected will vary on the basis of the individual decision to be  made  or the specific purpose of the analysis  but will typically include information about the economy  industry and company as well as information about comparable peer companies  Much of the information  will likely come from outside the company such as economic statistics industry reports trade  publications and databases containing information on competitors  The company itself provides some of  the core information for analysis in its financial reports press releases investor conference calls and  webcasts 
5,26,Companies prepare financial reports at regular intervals  annually semiannually and or quarterly  depending on the applicable regulatory requirements   Financial reports include financial statements along  with supplemental disclosures necessary to assess the company s financial position and periodic  performance  Financial statements are the result of an accounting recordkeeping process that records  economic activities of a company following the applicable accounting standards and principles  These  statements summarize the accounting information mainly for users outside the company  such as  investors creditors analysts and others  because users of financial information inside a company have  direct access to the underlying financial data that are summarized in the financial statements and to other  information that is collected but not included in the financial reporting process  Financial statements are  almost always audited by independent accountants who provide an opinion on whether the financial  statements present fairly the company s performance and financial position in accordance with a  specified applicable set of accounting standards and principles 
6,26,     Financial Statements and Supplementary Information
7,26,A complete set of financial statements include a statement of financial position  i e  a balance sheet  a  statement of comprehensive income  i e  a single statement of comprehensive income or an income  statement and a statement of comprehensive income  a statement of changes in equity and a statement of  cash flows   The balance sheet portrays the company s financial position at a given point in time  The  statement of comprehensive income and statement of cash flows present different aspects of a company s  performance over a period of time  The statement of changes in equity provides additional information  regarding the changes in a company s financial position  In addition the accompanying notes or footnotes  to the financial statements are required and considered an integral part of a complete set of financial  statements

2,27,Along with the required financial statements a company typically provides additional information in its  financial reports  In many jurisdictions some or all of this additional information is mandated by  regulators or accounting standards boards  The additional information provided may include a letter from  the chairman of the company a report from management discussing the results  typically called  management discussion and analysis  MD A  or management commentary  an external auditor s report  providing assurances a governance report describing the structure of the company s board of directors  and a corporate responsibility report  As part of his or her analysis the financial analyst should read and  assess this additional information along with the financial statements  The following sections describe and  illustrate each financial statement and some of the additional information 
3,27,       Balance Sheet

2,29,At    December      Volkswagen s total resources or assets were      billion  This number is the sum  of non current assets of     billion and current assets of     billion   Total equity was     billion   Although Volkswagen does not give a total amount for all the balance sheet liabilities it can be  determined by adding the non current and current liabilities        million          million            million or      billion  
3,29,Referring back to the basic accounting equation Assets   Liabilities   Equity we have      billion         billion       billion  In other words Volkswagen has assets of      billion owes      billion and  thus has equity of     billion  Using the balance sheet and applying financial statement analysis the  analyst can answer such questions as
4,29,  Has the company s liquidity  ability to meet short term obligations  improved 
5,29,  Is the company solvent  does it have sufficient resources to cover its obligations  
6,29,  What is the company s financial position relative to the industry 
7,29,Volkswagen a German based automobile manufacturer prepares its financial statements in accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS   IFRS require companies to present classified  balance sheets that show current and non current assets and current and non current liabilities as separate  classifications  However IFRS do not prescribe a particular ordering or format and the order in which  companies present their balance sheet items is largely a function of tradition  As shown Volkswagen  presents non current assets before current assets owners  equity before liabilities and non current  liabilities before current liabilities  This method generally reflects a presentation from least liquid to most  liquid  In other countries the typical order of presentation may differ  For example in the United States  Australia and Canada companies usually present their assets and liabilities from most liquid to least  liquid  Cash is typically the first asset shown and equity is presented after liabilities

2,31,       Statement of Comprehensive Income
3,31,The statement of comprehensive income under IFRS can be presented as a single statement of  comprehensive income or as two statements an income statement and a statement of comprehensive  income that begins with profit or loss from the income statement  The Volkswagen Group chose the latter  form of presentation rather than a single statement 
4,31,         Income Statement
5,31,The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company s business activities  over a period of time  The income statement communicates how much revenue and other income the  company generated during a period and the expenses it incurred to generate that revenue and other  income  Revenue typically refers to amounts charged for the delivery of goods or services in the ordinary  activities of a business  Other income includes gains which may or may not arise in the ordinary activities  of the business  Expenses reflect outflows depletions of assets and incurrences of liabilities that  decrease equity  Expenses typically include such items as cost of sales  cost of goods sold  administrative  expenses and income tax expenses and may be defined to include losses  Net income  revenue plus other  income minus expenses  on the income statement is often referred to as the  bottom line  because of its  proximity to the bottom of the income statement  Net income may also be referred to as  net earnings    net profit  and  profit or loss   In the event that expenses exceed revenues and other income the result  is referred to as  net loss  
6,31,Income statements are reported on a consolidated basis meaning that they include the income and  expenses of subsidiary companies under the control of the parent  reporting  company  The income
7,31,statement is sometimes referred to as a statement of operations or profit and loss  P L  statement 
8,31,The basic equation underlying the income statement is Revenue   Other income   Expenses   Income    Expenses   Net income 
9,31,In general terms when one company  the parent  controls another company  the subsidiary  the parent  presents its own financial statement information consolidated with that of the subsidiary   When a parent  company owns more than    percent of the voting shares of a subsidiary company it is presumed to  control the subsidiary and thus presents consolidated financial statements   Each line item of the  consolidated income statement includes the entire amount from the relevant line item on the subsidiary s  income statement  after removing any intercompany transactions   however if the parent does not own      percent of the subsidiary it is necessary for the parent to present an allocation of net income to the  minority interests  Minority interests also called non controlling interests refer to owners of the  remaining shares of the subsidiary that are not owned by the parent  The share of consolidated net income  attributable to minority interests is shown at the bottom of the income statement along with the net  income attributable to shareholders of the parent company  Exhibit   presents the income statement of the  Volkswagen Group from its Annual Report

15,32,Exhibit   shows that Volkswagen s sales revenue for the fiscal year ended    December      was          million  Subtracting cost of sales from revenue gives gross profit of        million  After  subtracting operating costs and expenses and adding other operating income the company s operating  profit totals       million  Operating profit represents the results of the company s usual business  activities before deducting interest expense or taxes  Operating profit  also called operating income  is  thus often referred to as earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT   Next operating profit is increased by  Volkswagen s share of the profits generated by certain of its investments       million  and by profits  from its other financial activities       million  and decreased by finance costs  i e  interest expense  of        million resulting in profit before tax of       million  Total income tax expense for      was       million resulting in profit after tax  net income  of      million 
16,32,After allocating the losses attributable to minority interest ownership in Volkswagen subsidiary  companies the profit attributable to shareholders of Volkswagen for      was      million  Allocating  the losses attributable to minority interest ownership resulted in the allocation to shareholders of the  parent company Volkswagen AG exceeding net income  profit after tax   Volkswagen s disclosures  indicate that its minority interests relate primarily to Scania AB a subsidiary in which Volkswagen owns  about    percent of the voting rights  with the minority interests owning the remaining    percent  
17,32,Companies present both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement   Earnings per share numbers represent net income attributable to the class of shareholders divided by the  relevant number of shares of stock outstanding during the period  Basic earnings per share is calculated  using the weighted average number of common  ordinary  shares that were actually outstanding during  the period and the profit or loss attributable to the common shareowners  Diluted earnings per share uses  diluted shares the number of shares that would hypothetically be outstanding if potentially dilutive  claims on common shares  e g  stock options or convertible bonds  were exercised or converted by their  holders and an appropriately adjusted profit or loss attributable to the common shareowners

2,33,Volkswagen has two types of shareholders ordinary and preferred and presents earnings per share  information for both although there is no requirement to present earnings per share information for  preferred shareowners  Volkswagen s basic earnings per ordinary share was        A note to the  company s financial statements explains that this number was calculated as follows       million profit  attributable to shareholders of Volkswagen of which      million is attributable to ordinary shareholders  and      million is attributable to preferred shareholders  The      million attributable to ordinary  shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of     million shares equals  basic earnings per share for      of        Similar detail is provided in the notes for each of the earnings  per share numbers 
3,33,An analyst examining the income statement might note that Volkswagen was profitable in both years  The  company s profitability declined substantially in      primarily because of lower sales and reduced gross  profit  This was not unexpected given the global financial and economic crisis in that year  A better  understanding of Volkswagen s profitability could likely be gained by examining income statements over  a longer time period  The analyst might formulate questions related to profitability such as the following 
4,33,  Is the change in revenue related to an increase in units sold an increase in prices or some  combination 
5,33,  If the company has multiple business segments  for example Volkswagen s segments include  passenger cars light commercial vehicles and financial services among others  how are the  segments  revenue and profits changing 
6,33,  How does the company compare with other companies in the industry 
7,33,Answering such questions requires the analyst to gather analyze and interpret information from a  number of sources including but not limited to the income statement 
8,33,         Other Comprehensive Income
9,33,Comprehensive income includes all items that impact owners  equity but are not the result of transactions  with shareowners  Some of these items are included in the calculation of net income and some are  included in other comprehensive income  OCI   When comprehensive income is presented in two  statements the statement of comprehensive income begins with the profit or loss from the income  statement and then presents the components of other comprehensive income

12,34,Exhibit   shows that other comprehensive income although smaller in absolute terms than profit after tax   net income  had a significant effect on total comprehensive income  In      other comprehensive  income represented approximately    percent of total comprehensive income and was approximately     percent of the size of profit after tax  net income   In      other comprehensive income was negative  a  loss  and was approximately    percent of the size of profit after tax  net income  in absolute terms  The  statement of comprehensive income will be discussed in greater detail in a later reading  The next section  briefly describes the statement of changes in equity 
13,34,       Statement of Changes in Equity
14,34,The statement of changes in equity variously called the  statement of changes in owners  equity  or   statement of changes in shareholders  equity  primarily serves to report changes in the owners   investment in the business over time  The basic components of owners  equity are paid in capital and  retained earnings  Retained earnings include the cumulative amount of the company s profits that have  been retained in the company  In addition non controlling or minority interests and reserves that  represent accumulated other comprehensive income items are included in equity  The latter items may be  shown separately or included in retained earnings  Volkswagen includes reserves as components of  retained earnings 
15,34,The statement of changes in equity is organized to present for each component of equity the beginning  balance any increases during the period any decreases during the period and the ending balance  For  paid in capital an example of an increase is a new issuance of equity and an example of a decrease is a  repurchase of previously issued stock  For retained earnings income  both net income as reported on the  income statement and other comprehensive income  is the most common increase and a dividend payment  is the most common decrease 
16,34,Volkswagen s balance sheet in Exhibit   shows that equity at the end of      totaled        million  compared with        million at the end of       The company s statement of changes in equity  presents additional detail on the change in each line item  Exhibit   presents an excerpt of the statement of  changes in equity of the Volkswagen Group from its Annual Report

75,35,       Cash Flow Statement
76,35,Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a company s success in terms of  performance and financial position cash flow is also vital to a company s long term success  Disclosing  the sources and uses of cash helps creditors investors and other statement users evaluate the company s  liquidity solvency and financial flexibility  Financial flexibility is the ability of the company to react  and adapt to financial adversities and opportunities  The cash flow statement classifies all cash flows of  the company into three categories  operating investing and financing  Cash flows from operating  activities are those cash flows not classified as investing or financing and generally involve the cash  effects of transactions that enter into the determination of net income and hence comprise the day to day  operations of the company  Cash flows from investing activities are those cash flows from activities  associated with the acquisition and disposal of long term assets such as property and equipment  Cash  flows from financing activities are those cash flows from activities related to obtaining or repaying  capital to be used in the business  IFRS permit more flexibility than US GAAP in classifying dividend  and interest receipts and payments within these categories

6,37,The operating activities section of Volkswagen s cash flow statement begins with profit before tax        million subtracts actual income tax payments and then adjusts this amount for the effects of non  cash transactions accruals and deferrals and transactions of an investing and financing nature to arrive at  the amount of cash generated from operating activities of        million  This approach to reporting  cash flow from operating activities is termed the indirect method  The direct method of reporting cash  flows from operating activities discloses major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments   Examples of such classes are cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and employees 
7,37,The indirect method emphasizes the different perspectives of the income statement and cash flow  statement  On the income statement income is reported when earned not necessarily when cash is  received and expenses are reported when incurred not necessarily when paid  The cash flow statement  presents another aspect of performance  the ability of a company to generate cash flow from running its  business  Ideally for an established company the analyst would like to see that the primary source of  cash flow is from operating activities as opposed to investing or financing activities 
8,37,The sum of the net cash flows from operating investing and financing activities and the effect of  exchange rates on cash equals the net change in cash during the fiscal year  For Volkswagen the sum of  these four items was       million in      which thus increased the company s cash excluding  amounts held in time deposit investments from       million at the beginning of the period to         million at the end of the period  As disclosed in a note to the financial statements the time deposit  investments are     million and       million for the years      and      respectively  The note also  disclosed that     million of cash and cash equivalents held for sale  sic  are included in the cash and  cash equivalents as reported in cash flow statement but are not included in the cash and cash equivalents  as reported in the balance sheet in       When these amounts are included with the amounts shown on the  cash flow statement the total cash and cash equivalents for the years      and      are                           million and        million  These are the same amounts reported as cash and cash equivalents  on the balance sheets in Exhibit    The cash flow statement will be covered in more depth in a later  reading 
9,37,       Financial Notes and Supplementary Schedules
10,37,The notes  also sometimes referred to as footnotes  that accompany the four financial statements are  required and are an integral part of the complete set of financial statements  The notes provide  information that is essential to understanding the information provided in the primary statements   Volkswagen s      financial statements for example include    pages of notes 
11,37,The notes disclose the basis of preparation for the financial statements  For example Volkswagen  discloses in its first note that its fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year that its financial statements  are prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union that the statements are prepared  in compliance with German law that the statements are denominated in millions of euros unless  otherwise specified and that the figures have been rounded which might give rise to minor discrepancies  when figures are added  Volkswagen also discloses that its financial statements are on a consolidated  basis that is including Volkswagen AG and all of the subsidiary companies it controls

2,38,The notes also disclose information about the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare  the financial statements  As will be discussed in later readings both IFRS and US GAAP allow some  flexibility in choosing among alternative policies and methods when accounting for certain items  This  flexibility aims to meet the divergent needs of many businesses for reporting a variety of economic  transactions  In addition to differences in accounting policies and methods differences arise as a result of  estimates needed to record and measure transactions events and financial statement line items 
3,38,Overall flexibility in accounting choices is necessary because ideally a company will select those  policies methods and estimates that are allowable and most relevant and that fairly reflect the unique  economic environment of the company s business and industry  Flexibility can however create  challenges for the analyst because the use of different policies methods and estimates reduces  comparability across different companies  financial statements  Comparability occurs when different  companies  information is measured and reported in a similar manner over time  Comparability helps the  analyst identify and analyze the real economic differences across companies rather than differences that  arise solely from different accounting choices  Because comparability of financial statements is a critical  requirement for objective financial analysis an analyst should be aware of the potential for differences in  accounting choices even when comparing two companies that use the same set of accounting standards 
4,38,For example if a company acquires a piece of equipment to use in its operations accounting standards  require that the cost of the equipment be reported as an expense by allocating its cost less any residual  value in a systematic manner over the equipment s useful life  This allocation of the cost is known as  depreciation  Accounting standards permit flexibility however in determining the manner in which  each year s expense is determined  Two companies may acquire similar equipment but use different  methods and assumptions to record the expense over time  An analyst s ability to compare the companies   performance is hindered by the difference  Analysts must understand reporting choices in order to make  appropriate adjustments when comparing companies  financial positions and performance 
5,38,A company s significant accounting choices  policies methods and estimates  must be discussed in the  notes to the financial statements  For example a note containing a summary of significant accounting  policies includes how the company recognizes its revenues and depreciates its non current tangible assets   Analysts must understand the accounting choices a company makes and determine whether they are  similar to those of other companies identified and used as benchmarks or comparables  If the policies of  the companies being compared are different the analyst who understands accounting and financial  reporting can often make necessary adjustments so that the financial statement data used are more  comparable 
6,38,For many companies the financial notes and supplemental schedules provide explanatory information  about every line item  or almost every line item  on the balance sheet and income statement as illustrated  by the note references in Volkswagen s balance sheet and income statement in Exhibits   and    In  addition note disclosures include information about the following  this is not an exhaustive list

21,39,An analyst uses a significant amount of judgment in deciding how to incorporate information from note  disclosures into the analysis  For example such information as financial instrument risk contingencies  and legal proceedings can alert an analyst to risks that can affect a company s financial position and  performance in the future and that require monitoring over time  As another example information about a  company s operating segments can be useful as a means of quickly understanding what a company does  and how and where it earns money  The operating segment data shown in Exhibit   appear in the notes to  the financial statements for Volkswagen   The totals of the segment data do not equal the amounts  reported in the company s financial statements because the financial statement data are adjusted for  intersegment activities and unallocated items  The note provides a complete reconciliation of the segment  data to the reported data   From the data in Exhibit   an analyst can quickly see that most of the  company s revenues and operating profits come from the sale of passenger cars and light commercial  vehicles  Over    percent of the company s revenues was generated by this segment in both years  In       this segment accounted for over    percent of the company s total segment operating profits  although the percentage declined to    percent in      because of higher sales growth in the other two  segments  Experience using the disclosures of a company and its competitors typically enhances an  analyst s judgment about the relative importance of different disclosures and the ways in which they can  be helpful

2,40,Publicly held companies typically include a section in their annual reports where management discusses a  variety of issues of concern including the nature of the business past results and future outlook  This  section is referred to by a variety of names including management report ing  management commentary  operating and financial review and management s discussion and analysis  Inclusion of a management  report is recommended by the International Organization of Securities Commissions and frequently  required by regulatory authorities such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  or the UK  Financial Reporting Council  FRC   In Germany management reporting has been required since      and  is audited  The discussion by management is arguably one of the most useful parts of a company s annual  report besides the financial statements themselves  however other than excerpts from the financial  statements information included in the management commentary is typically unaudited  When using  information from the management report an analyst should be aware of whether the information is  audited or unaudited 
3,40,To help improve the quality of the discussion by management the International Accounting Standards  Board  IASB  issued an IFRS Practice Statement  Management Commentary  in December      that  includes a framework for the preparation and presentation of management commentary  The framework  provides guidance rather than sets forth requirements in a standard  The framework identifies five content  elements of a  decision useful management commentary   Those content elements include    the nature  of the business     management s objectives and strategies     the company s significant resources risks  and relationships     results of operations  and    critical performance measures 
4,40,In the United States the SEC requires listed companies to provide an MD A and specifies the content   Management must highlight any favorable or unfavorable trends and identify significant events and  uncertainties that affect the company s liquidity capital resources and results of operations  The MD A  must also provide information about the effects of inflation changing prices or other material events and  uncertainties that may cause the future operating results and financial condition to materially depart from  the current reported financial information  In addition the MD A must provide information about off  balance sheet obligations and about contractual commitments such as purchase obligations  Companies  should also provide disclosure in the MD A that discusses the critical accounting policies that require  management to make subjective judgments and that have a significant impact on reported financial  results 
5,40,The management commentary or MD A is a good starting place for understanding information in the  financial statements  In particular the forward looking disclosures in an MD A such as those about  planned capital expenditures new store openings or divestitures can be useful in projecting a company s  future performance  However the commentary is only one input for the analyst seeking an objective and  independent perspective on a company s performance and prospects 
6,40,The management report in the Annual Report      of Volkswagen Group includes much information of  potential interest to an analyst  The    page management report contains sections titled Business  Development  Shares and Bonds  Net Assets  Financial Position  Results of Operations  Volkswagen AG   condensed according to German Commercial Code   Value Enhancing Factors  Risk Report  and Report  on Expected Developments 
7,40,       Auditor s Reports
8,40,Financial statements presented in companies  annual reports are generally required to be audited   examined  by an independent accounting firm in accordance with specified auditing standards  The  independent auditor then provides a written opinion on the financial statements  This opinion is referred  to as the audit report  Audit reports take slightly different forms in different jurisdictions but the basic  components including a specific statement of the auditor s opinion are similar  Audits of financial  statements may be required by contractual arrangement law or regulation

2,41,International standards for auditing have been developed by the International Auditing and Assurance  Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants  These standards have been adopted by  many countries and are referenced in audit reports issued in those countries  Other countries such as the  United States specify their own auditing standards  With the enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of       in the United States auditing standards for public companies are promulgated by the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board 
3,41,Under international standards for auditing  ISAs  the objectives of an auditor in conducting an audit of  financial statements are
4,41,A  To obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement whether due to fraud or error thereby enabling the auditor to express an  opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared in all material respects in accordance  with an applicable financial reporting framework  and
5,41,B  To report on the financial statements and communicate as required by the ISAs in accordance with  the auditor s findings  
6,41,Publicly traded companies may also have requirements set by regulators or stock exchanges such as  appointing an independent audit committee within its board of directors to oversee the audit process  The  audit process provides a basis for the independent auditor to express an audit opinion on whether the  information presented in the audited financial statements present fairly the financial position  performance and cash flows of the company in accordance with a specified set of accounting standards   Because audits are designed and conducted using audit sampling techniques and financial statement line  items may be based on estimates and assumptions independent auditors cannot express an opinion that  provides absolute assurance about the accuracy or precision of the financial statements  Instead the  independent audit report provides reasonable assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented  meaning that there is a high probability that the audited financial statements are free from material error  fraud or illegal acts that have a direct effect on the financial statements 
7,41,The standard independent audit report for a publicly traded company normally has several paragraphs  under both the international and US auditing standards  The first or  introductory  paragraph describes  the financial statements that were audited and the responsibilities of both management and the  independent auditor  The second or  scope  paragraph describes the nature of the audit process and  provides the basis for the auditor s expression about reasonable assurance on the fairness of the financial  statements  The third or  opinion  paragraph expresses the auditor s opinion on the fairness of the audited  financial statements 
8,41,An unqualified audit opinion states that the financial statements give a  true and fair view   international   or are  fairly presented   international and US  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  This  is often referred to as a  clean  opinion and is the one that analysts would like to see in a financial report   There are several other types of opinions  A qualified audit opinion is one in which there is some scope  limitation or exception to accounting standards  Exceptions are described in the audit report with  additional explanatory paragraphs so that the analyst can determine the importance of the exception  An  adverse audit opinion is issued when an auditor determines that the financial statements materially depart  from accounting standards and are not fairly presented  An adverse opinion makes analysis of the  financial statements easy  Do not bother analyzing these statements because the company s financial  statements cannot be relied on  Finally a disclaimer of opinion occurs when for some reason such as a  scope limitation the auditors are unable to issue an opinion  Exhibit    presents the independent auditor s  report for Volkswagen  Note that Volkswagen received an unqualified or clean audit opinion from  PricewaterhouseCoopers for the company s fiscal year ended    December

6,42,We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with       HGB  and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by  the Institut der Wirtschaftspr fer  Institute of Public Auditors in Germany   IDW   Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially  affecting the presentation of the net assets financial position and results of operations in the  consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting  framework and in the combined management report are detected with reasonable assurance   Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and  expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit  procedures  The effectiveness of the accounting related internal control system and the evidence  supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the combined  management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit   The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in  consolidation the determination of the entities to be included in consolidation the accounting  and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Company s Board of  Management as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial  statements and the combined management report  We believe that our audit provides a  reasonable basis for our opinion

8,43,In the United States under the Sarbanes Oxley Act the auditors must also express an opinion on the  company s internal control systems  This information may be provided in a separate opinion or  incorporated as a paragraph in the opinion related to the financial statements  The internal control system  is the company s internal system that is designed among other things to ensure that the company s  process for generating financial reports is sound  Although management has always been responsible for  maintaining effective internal control the Sarbanes Oxley Act greatly increases management s  responsibility for demonstrating that the company s internal controls are effective  Management of  publicly traded companies in the United States are now required by securities regulators to explicitly  accept responsibility for the effectiveness of internal control evaluate the effectiveness of internal control  using suitable control criteria support the evaluation with sufficient competent evidence and provide a  report on internal control 
9,43,Although these reports and attestations provide some assurances to analysts they are not infallible  The  analyst must always use a degree of healthy skepticism when analyzing financial statements 
10,43,     Other Sources of Information
11,43,The information described in Section     is generally provided to shareholders at least annually  In  addition companies also provide information on management and director compensation company stock  performance and any potential conflicts of interest that may exist between management the board and  shareholders  This information may appear in the company s annual report or other publicly available  documents  Public companies often provide this information in proxy statements which are statements  distributed to shareholders about matters that are to be put to a vote at the company s annual  or special   meeting of shareholders 
12,43,Interim reports are also provided by the company either semiannually or quarterly depending on the  applicable regulatory requirements  Interim reports generally present the four basic financial statements  and condensed notes but are not audited  These interim reports provide updated information on a  company s performance and financial position since the last annual period 
13,43,Companies also provide relevant current information on their websites in press releases and in  conference calls with analysts and investors  One type of press release which analysts often consider to  be particularly important is the periodic earnings announcement  The earnings announcement often  happens well before the company files its formal financial statements  Such earnings announcements are  often followed by a conference call in which the company s senior executives describe the company s  performance and answer questions posed by conference call participants  Following the earnings  conference call the investor relations portion of the company s website may post a recording of the call  accompanied by slides and supplemental information discussed during the call

2,44,When performing financial statement analysis analysts should review all these company sources of  information as well as information from external sources regarding the economy the industry the  company and peer  comparable  companies  Information on the economy industry and peer companies  is useful in putting the company s financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the  company s future  In most cases information from sources apart from the company is crucial to an  analyst s effectiveness  For example an analyst studying a consumer oriented company will typically  seek direct experience with the products  taste the food or drink use the shampoo or soap visit the stores  or hotels   An analyst following a highly regulated industry will study the existing and expected relevant  regulations  An analyst following a highly technical industry will gain relevant expertise personally or  seek input from a technical specialist  In sum thorough research goes beyond financial reports 
3,44,The next section presents a framework for using all this information in financial statement analysis 
4,44,   FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
5,44,Analysts work in a variety of positions within the investment management industry  Some are equity  analysts whose main objective is to evaluate potential investments in a company s equity securities  i e   the shares or stock it issues  as a basis for deciding whether a prospective investment is attractive and  what an appropriate purchase price might be  Others are credit analysts who evaluate the credit  worthiness of a company to decide whether  and with what terms  a loan should be made or what credit  rating should be assigned  Analysts may also be involved in a variety of other tasks such as evaluating  the performance of a subsidiary company evaluating a private equity investment or finding stocks that  are overvalued for purposes of taking a short position  This section presents a generic framework for  financial statement analysis that can be used in these various tasks  The framework is summarized in

2,46,     Articulate the Purpose and Context of Analysis
3,46,Prior to undertaking any analysis it is essential to understand the purpose of the analysis  An  understanding of the purpose is particularly important in financial statement analysis because of the  numerous available techniques and the substantial amount of data 
4,46,Some analytical tasks are well defined in which case articulating the purpose of the analysis requires little  decision making by the analyst  For example a periodic credit review of an investment grade debt  portfolio or an equity analyst s report on a particular company may be guided by institutional norms such  that the purpose of the analysis is given  Furthermore the format procedures and or sources of  information may also be given 
5,46,For other analytical tasks articulating the purpose of the analysis requires the analyst to make decisions   The purpose of an analysis guides further decisions about the approach the tools the data sources the  format in which to report the results of the analysis and the relative importance of different aspects of the  analysis 
6,46,When facing a substantial amount of data a less experienced analyst may be tempted to just start making  calculations and generating financial ratios without considering what is relevant for the decision at hand   It is generally advisable to resist this temptation and thus avoid unnecessary or pointless efforts  Consider  the questions  If you could have all the calculations and ratios completed instantly what conclusion  would you be able to draw  What question would you be able to answer  What decision would your  answer support 
7,46,The analyst should also define the context at this stage  Who is the intended audience  What is the end  product for example a final report explaining conclusions and recommendations  What is the time  frame  i e  when is the report due   What resources and resource constraints are relevant to completion of  the analysis  Again the context may be predefined  i e  standard and guided by institutional norms  
8,46,Having clarified the purpose and context of the financial statement analysis the analyst should next  compile the specific questions to be answered by the analysis  For example if the purpose of the financial  statement analysis  or more likely the particular stage of a larger analysis  is to compare the historical  performance of three companies operating in a particular industry specific questions would include the  following  What has been the relative growth rate of the companies and what has been the relative  profitability of the companies 
9,46,     Collect Data
10,46,Next the analyst obtains the data required to answer the specific questions  A key part of this step is  obtaining an understanding of the company s business financial performance and financial position   including trends over time and in comparison with peer companies   For historical analyses financial  statement data alone are adequate in some cases  For example to screen a large number of alternative  companies to find those with a minimum level of profitability financial statement data alone would be  adequate  But to address more in depth questions such as why and how one company performed better or  worse than its competitors additional information would be required  As another example to compare the  historical performance of two companies in a particular industry the historical financial statements would  be sufficient to determine which had faster growing sales or earnings and which was more profitable   however a broader comparison with overall industry growth and profitability would obviously require  industry data

2,47,Furthermore information on the economy and industry is necessary to understand the environment in  which the company operates  Analysts often take a top down approach whereby they    gain an  understanding of the macroeconomic environment such as prospects for growth in the economy and  inflation    analyze the prospects of the industry in which the subject company operates based on the  expected macroeconomic environment and    determine the prospects for the company in the expected  industry and macroeconomic environments  For example an analyst may need to forecast future growth  in earnings for a company  To project future growth past company data provide one basis for statistical  forecasting  however an understanding of economic and industry conditions can improve the analyst s  ability to forecast a company s earnings on the basis of forecasts of overall economic and industry  activity 
3,47,     Process Data
4,47,After obtaining the requisite financial statement and other information the analyst processes these data  using appropriate analytical tools  For example processing the data may involve computing ratios or  growth rates  preparing common size financial statements  creating charts  performing statistical analyses  such as regressions or Monte Carlo simulations  performing equity valuation  performing sensitivity  analyses  or using any other analytical tools or combination of tools that are available and appropriate for  the task  A comprehensive financial analysis at this stage would include the following 
5,47,  Reading and evaluating financial statements for each company being analyzed  This includes  reading the notes and understanding what accounting standards have been used  for example IFRS  or US GAAP  what accounting choices have been made  for example when to report revenue on  the income statement  and what operating decisions have been made that affect reported financial  statements  for example leasing versus purchasing equipment  
6,47,  Making any needed adjustments to the financial statements to facilitate comparison when the  unadjusted statements of the subject companies reflect differences in accounting standards  accounting choices or operating decisions  Note that commonly used databases do not make such  analyst adjustments 
7,47,  Preparing or collecting common size financial statement data  which scale data to directly reflect  percentages  e g  of sales  or changes  e g  from the prior year   and financial ratios  which are  measures of various aspects of corporate performance based on financial statement elements   On  the basis of common size financial statements and financial ratios analysts can evaluate a  company s relative profitability liquidity leverage efficiency and valuation in relation to past  results and or peers  results 
8,47,     Analyze Interpret the Processed Data
9,47,Once the data have been processed the next step critical to any analysis is to interpret the output  The  answer to a specific financial analysis question is seldom the numerical answer alone  Rather the answer  to the analytical question relies on the analyst s interpretation of the output and the use of this interpreted  output to support a conclusion or recommendation  The answers to the specific analytical questions may  themselves achieve the underlying purpose of the analysis but usually a conclusion or recommendation  is required  For example an equity analysis may require a buy hold or sell decision or a conclusion  about the value of a share of stock  In support of the decision the analysis would cite such information as  target value relative performance expected future performance given a company s strategic position  quality of management and whatever other information was important in reaching the decision

2,48,     Develop and Communicate Conclusions Recommendations
3,48,Communicating the conclusion or recommendation in an appropriate format is the next step  The  appropriate format will vary by analytical task by institution and or by audience  For example an equity  analyst s report would typically include the following components 
4,48,  summary and investment conclusion 
5,48,  earnings projections 
6,48,  valuation 
7,48,  business summary 
8,48,  risk industry and competitive analysis 
9,48,  historical performance  and
10,48,  forecasts 
11,48,The contents of reports may also be specified by regulatory agencies or professional standards  For  example the CFA Institute Standards of Practice Handbook  Handbook  dictates standards that must be  followed in communicating recommendations  According to the Handbook 
12,48,Standard V B  states that members and candidates should communicate in a recommendation  the factors that were instrumental in making the investment recommendation  A critical part  of this requirement is to distinguish clearly between opinions and facts  In preparing a  research report the member or candidate must present the basic characteristics of the security  ies  being analyzed which will allow the reader to evaluate the report and incorporate  information the reader deems relevant to his or her investment decision making process  
13,48,The Handbook requires that limitations to the analysis and any risks inherent to the investment be  disclosed  Furthermore the Handbook requires that any report include elements important to the analysis  and conclusions so that readers can evaluate the conclusions themselves 
14,48,     Follow Up
15,48,The process does not end with the report  If an equity investment is made or a credit rating is assigned  periodic review is required to determine if the original conclusions and recommendations are still valid  In  the case of a rejected investment follow up may not be necessary but may be useful in determining  whether the analysis process is adequate or should be refined  for example if a rejected investment turns  out to be successful in the market perhaps the rejection was due to inadequate analysis   Follow up may  involve repeating all the previous steps in the process on a periodic basis

2,49,SUMMARY
3,49,The information presented in financial and other reports including the financial statements notes and  management s commentary help the financial analyst to assess a company s performance and financial  position  An analyst may be called on to perform a financial analysis for a variety of reasons including  the valuation of equity securities the assessment of credit risk the performance of due diligence in an  acquisition and the evaluation of a subsidiary s performance relative to other business units  Major  considerations in both equity analysis and credit analysis are evaluating a company s financial position  its ability to generate profits and cash flow and its ability to generate future growth in profits and cash  flow 
4,49,This reading has presented an overview of financial statement analysis  Among the major points covered  are the following 
5,49,  The primary purpose of financial reports is to provide information and data about a company s  financial position and performance including profitability and cash flows  The information  presented in financial reports including the financial statements and notes and other  reports including management s commentary or management s discussion and analysis allows  the financial analyst to assess a company s financial position and performance and trends in that  performance 
6,49,  The basic financial statements are the statement of financial position  i e  the balance sheet  the  statement of comprehensive income  i e  a single statement of comprehensive income or two  statements consisting of an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income  the  statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows 
7,49,  The balance sheet discloses what resources a company controls  assets  and what it owes   liabilities  at a specific point in time  Owners  equity represents the net assets of the company  it is  the owners  residual interest in or residual claim on the company s assets after deducting its  liabilities  The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet  assets liabilities and  owners  equity  may be shown in equation form as follows  Assets   Liabilities   Owners  equity 
8,49,  The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company s business  activities over a period of time  The income statement communicates how much revenue and other  income the company generated during a period and what expenses including losses it incurred in  connection with generating that revenue and other income  The basic equation underlying the  income statement is Revenue   Other income   Expenses   Net income 
9,49,  The statement of comprehensive income includes all items that change owners  equity except  transactions with owners  Some of these items are included as part of net income and some are  reported as other comprehensive income  OCI  
10,49,  The statement of changes in equity provides information about increases or decreases in the various  components of owners  equity 
11,49,  Although the income statement and balance sheet provide measures of a company s success cash  and cash flow are also vital to a company s long term success  Disclosing the sources and uses of  cash helps creditors investors and other statement users evaluate the company s liquidity  solvency and financial flexibility 
12,49,  The notes  also referred to as footnotes  that accompany the financial statements are an integral part  of those statements and provide information that is essential to understanding the statements   Analysts should evaluate note disclosures regarding the use of alternative accounting methods  estimates and assumptions

2,50,  In addition to the financial statements a company provides other sources of information that are  useful to the financial analyst  As part of his or her analysis the financial analyst should read and  assess this additional information particularly that presented in the management commentary  also  called management report ing  operating and financial review and management s discussion and  analysis  MD A   
3,50,  A publicly traded company must have an independent audit performed on its annual financial  statements  The auditor s report expresses an opinion on the financial statements and provides some  assurance about whether the financial statements fairly present a company s financial position  performance and cash flows  In addition for US publicly traded companies auditors must also  express an opinion on the company s internal control systems 
4,50,  Information on the economy industry and peer companies is useful in putting the company s  financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the company s future  In most  cases information from sources apart from the company are crucial to an analyst s effectiveness 
5,50,  The financial statement analysis framework provides steps that can be followed in any financial  statement analysis project  These steps are 
6,50,  articulate the purpose and context of the analysis 
7,50,  collect input data 
8,50,  process data

13,54,    C is correct  Ratios are an output of the process data step but are an input into the analyze interpret  data step 
14,54,    A is correct  The follow up phase involves gathering information and repeating the analysis to  determine whether it is necessary to update reports and recommendations and then updating if  necessary

3,57,   INTRODUCTION
4,57,Financial reporting standards provide principles for preparing financial reports and determine  the types and amounts of information that must be provided to users of financial statements  including investors and creditors so that they may make informed decisions  This reading  focuses on the framework within which these standards are created  An understanding of the  underlying framework of financial reporting standards which is broader than knowledge of  specific accounting rules will allow an analyst to assess the valuation implications of financial  statement elements and transactions including transactions such as those that represent new  developments which are not specifically addressed by the standards 
5,57,Section   of this reading discusses the objective of financial statements and the importance of  financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation  Section   describes the roles of  financial reporting standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities and several of the financial  reporting standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities  Section   describes the trend  toward and barriers to convergence of global financial reporting standards  Section   describes  the International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  framework  and general requirements  for financial statements  Section   discusses the characteristics of an effective financial  reporting framework along with some of the barriers to a single coherent framework  Section    illustrates some of the specific differences between IFRS and US generally accepted accounting  practices  US GAAP  and Section   discusses the importance of monitoring developments in  financial reporting standards  A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA  Institute multiple choice format conclude the reading 
6,57,   THE OBJECTIVE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
7,57,The financial reports of a company include financial statements and other supplemental  disclosures necessary to assess a company s financial position and periodic financial  performance  Financial reporting is based on a simple premise  The International Accounting  Standards Board  IASB  which sets financial reporting standards that have been adopted in  many countries expressed it as follows in its Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting        Conceptual Framework        
8,57,http   e pub kreqzq taj   c u gv  vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print            x

2,58,The objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial  information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential  investors lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing  resources to the entity  Those decisions involve buying selling or holding equity  and debt instruments and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit  
3,58,The objective in the Conceptual Framework        differs from the objective of the  Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements         in a number  of key ways  The scope of the objective now extends to financial reporting which is broader  than the previously stated scope that covered financial statements only  Another difference is  that the objective now specifies the primary users for whom the reports are intended  existing  and potential investors etc   while the previously stated objective referred solely to a  wide  range of users   Also while the Conceptual Framework        identifies information that  should be reported including that about financial position  economic resources and claims   changes in economic resources and claims and financial performance reflected by accrual  accounting and past cash flows it does not list that information within the objective itself  unlike the previously stated objective 
4,58,Standards are developed in accordance with a framework so it is useful to have an agreed upon  framework to guide the development of standards  The joint conceptual framework project of  the IASB and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  aimed to develop a  common foundation for standards  Standards based on this foundation were to be principles  based internally consistent and converged  Until recently financial reporting standards were  primarily developed independently by each country s standard setting body  This independent  standard setting created a wide range of standards some of which were quite comprehensive  and complex  often considered to be rules based standards  and others more general  often  considered to be principles based standards   Accounting scandals and the economic crisis of            increased awareness of the need for high quality more uniform global financial  reporting standards and provided the impetus for stronger coordination among the major  standard setting bodies  Such coordination is also a natural outgrowth of the increased  globalization of capital markets 
5,58,Developing financial reporting standards is complicated because the underlying economic  reality is complicated  The financial transactions and financial position that companies aim to  represent in their financial reports are also complex  Furthermore uncertainty about various  aspects of transactions often results in the need for accruals and estimates both of which  necessitate judgment  Judgment varies from one preparer to the next  Accordingly standards  are needed to achieve some amount of consistency in these judgments  Even with such  standards there usually will be no single correct answer to the question of how to reflect  economic reality in financial reports  Nevertheless financial reporting standards try to limit the  range of acceptable answers in order to increase consistency in financial reports 
6,58,EXAMPLE  
7,58,Estimates in Financial Reporting
8,58,To facilitate comparisons across companies  cross sectional analysis  and over time for a  single company  time series analysis  it is important that accounting methods are  comparable and consistently applied  However accounting standards must be flexible  enough to recognize that differences exist in the underlying economics between  businesses

2,59,Suppose two companies buy the same model of machinery to be used in their respective  businesses  The machine is expected to last for several years  Financial reporting  standards typically require that both companies account for this equipment by initially  recording the cost of the machinery as an asset  Without such a standard the companies  could report the purchase of the equipment differently  For example one company  might record the purchase as an asset and the other might record the purchase as an  expense  An accounting standard ensures that both companies should record the  transaction in a similar manner 
3,59,Accounting standards typically require the cost of the machine to be apportioned over  the estimated useful life of an asset as an expense called depreciation  Because the two  companies may be operating the machinery differently financial reporting standards  must retain some flexibility  One company might operate the machinery only a few days  per week whereas the other company operates the equipment continuously throughout  the week  Given the difference in usage it would not be appropriate to require the two  companies to report an identical amount of depreciation expense each period  Financial  reporting standards must allow for some discretion such that management can match  their financial reporting choices to the underlying economics of their business while  ensuring that similar transactions are recorded in a similar manner between companies 
4,59,Financial statements of two companies with identical transactions in the fiscal year  prepared in accordance with the same set of financial reporting standards are most likely to be 
5,59,A  identical 
6,59,B  consistent 
7,59,C  comparable 
8,59,Solution 
9,59,C is correct  The companies  financial statements should be comparable  possible to  compare  because they should reflect the underlying economics of the transactions for  each company  The underlying economics may vary between companies so the  financial statements are not likely to be identical  Choices made by each company with  respect to accounting methods should be consistent but the choice across companies is  not necessarily consistent  Information about accounting choices will enhance a user s  ability to compare the companies  financial statements 
10,59,The IASB and the FASB have developed similar financial reporting frameworks which specify  the overall objective and qualities of information to be provided  Financial reports are intended  to provide information to many users including investors creditors employees customers and  others  As a result of this multipurpose nature financial reports are not designed solely with  asset valuation in mind  However financial reports provide important inputs into the process of  valuing a company or the securities a company issues  Understanding the financial reporting  framework including how and when judgments and estimates can affect the numbers  reported enables an analyst to evaluate the information reported and to use the information  appropriately when assessing a company s financial performance  Clearly such an  understanding is also important in assessing the financial impact of business decisions by and  in making comparisons across entities

2,60,   STANDARD SETTING BODIES AND  REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
3,60,A distinction must be made between standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities   Standard setting bodies such as the IASB and FASB are typically private sector self regulated  organizations with board members who are experienced accountants auditors users of financial  statements and academics  The requirement to prepare financial reports in accordance with  specified accounting standards is the responsibility of regulatory authorities  Regulatory  authorities such as the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority in Singapore the  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  in the United States and the Securities and  Exchange Commission in Brazil have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting  requirements and exert other controls over entities that participate in the capital markets within  their jurisdiction 
4,60,In other words generally standard setting bodies set the standards and regulatory authorities  recognise and enforce the standards  Without the recognition of the standards by the regulatory  authorities the private sector standard setting bodies would have no authority  Note however  that regulators often retain the legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their  jurisdiction and can overrule the private sector standard setting bodies 
5,60,EXAMPLE  
6,60,Industry Specific Regulation
7,60,In certain cases multiple regulatory bodies affect a company s financial reporting  requirements  For example in almost all jurisdictions around the world banking  specific regulatory bodies establish requirements related to risk based capital  measurement minimum capital adequacy provisions for doubtful loans and minimum  monetary reserves  An awareness of such regulations provides an analyst with the  context to understand a bank s business including the objectives and scope of allowed  activities  Insurance is another industry where specific regulations typically are in place   An analyst should be aware of such regulations to understand constraints on an  insurance company 
8,60,The following are examples of country specific bank regulators  In Canada the Office  of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions regulates and supervises all banks in  Canada as well as some other federally incorporated or registered financial institutions  or intermediaries  In Germany the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority  exercises supervision over financial institutions in accordance with the Banking Act  In  Japan the Financial Services Agency has regulatory authority over financial institutions   In the United States the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charters and  regulates all national banks  In some countries a single entity serves both as the central  bank and as the regulatory body for the country s financial institutions

2,61,In addition the Basel Accords establish and promote internationally consistent capital  requirements and risk management practices for larger international banks  The Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision among other functions has evolved into a standard  setter for bank supervision  The various regulations that affect banks present a challenge  for bank analysts 
3,61,Which of the following statements is most accurate 
4,61,A  As a general rule it is sufficient for an analyst covering an industry to be familiar  with financial reporting standards and regulations in his her country of residence 
5,61,B  An analyst should familiarize him herself with the regulations and reporting  standards that affect the company and or industry that he she is analyzing 
6,61,C  An analyst should be aware that financial reporting standards vary among  countries and may be industry specific but standards are so similar that the  analyst does not have to be concerned about it 
7,61,Solution 
8,61,B is correct  An analyst should familiarize him herself with the regulations and reporting  standards that affect the company and or industry being analyzed  This can be quite  challenging but given the potential effects necessary 
9,61,This section provides a brief overview of the International Accounting Standards Board and the  US Financial Accounting Standards Board  The overview is followed by descriptions of the  International Organization of Securities Commissions the US Securities and Exchange  Commission and capital markets regulation in the European Union  The topics covered in these  overviews were chosen to serve as examples of standard setting boards securities commissions  and capital market regulation  After reading these descriptions the reader should be able to  describe the functioning and roles of standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities in more  detail than is given in the introduction to this section 
10,61,     Accounting Standards Boards
11,61,Accounting standards boards exist in virtually every national market  These boards are typically  independent private not for profit organizations  Most users of financial statements know of  the International Accounting Standards Board that issues international financial reporting  standards and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board that is the source of US generally  accepted accounting principles  Most countries have an accounting standard setting body  There  are certain attributes that are typically common to these standard setters  After discussing the  IASB and the FASB some of the common and desirable attributes of accounting standards  boards will be identified

2,62,       International Accounting Standards Board
3,62,The IASB is the independent standard setting body of the IFRS Foundation  an independent  not for profit private sector organization  The Trustees of the IFRS Foundation reflect a  diversity of geographical and professional backgrounds  The Trustees appoint the members of  the IASB and related entities ensure the financing of the Foundation establish the budget and  monitor the IASB s strategy and effectiveness  The Trustees of the Foundation are accountable  to a monitoring board composed of public authorities that include representatives from the  European Commission IOSCO the Japan Financial Services Agency and the US SEC  The  chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision serves as an observer on the  Monitoring Board 
4,62,The Trustees of the IFRS Foundation make a commitment to act in the public interest  The  principle objectives of the IFRS Foundation are to develop and promote the use and adoption of  a single set of high quality financial standards  to ensure the standards result in transparent  comparable and decision useful information while taking into account the needs of a range of  sizes and types of entities in diverse economic settings  and to promote the convergence of  national accounting standards and IFRS  The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the  IASB is and is perceived as independent  Each member of the IASB is expected to exercise  independence of judgment in setting standards 
5,62,The members of the IASB are appointed by the Trustees on the basis of professional  competence and practical experience  As is true for the Trustees the members reflect a diversity  of geographical and professional backgrounds  The members deliberate develop and issue  international financial reporting standards   Two related entities with members appointed by  the Trustees are the IFRS Interpretations Committee and the IFRS Advisory Council   The  Interpretations Committee s members are responsible for reviewing accounting issues that arise  in the application of IFRS and are not specifically addressed by IFRS and for issuing  appropriate authoritative IASB approved interpretations  Note that the authoritative  interpretations must be approved by the IASB  The IFRS Advisory Council s members  represent a wide range of organizations and individuals that are affected by and interested in  international financial reporting  The Council provides advice to the IASB on among other  items agenda decisions and priorities 
6,62,The IASB has a basic process that it goes through when deliberating developing and issuing  international financial reporting standards  A simplified version of the typical process is as  follows  An issue is identified as a priority for consideration and placed on the IASB s agenda  in consultation with the Advisory Council  After considering an issue which may include  soliciting advice from others including national standard setters the IASB may publish an  exposure draft for public comment  In addition to soliciting public comment the IASB may  hold public hearings to discuss proposed standards  After reviewing the input of others the  IASB may issue a new or revised financial reporting standard  These standards are authoritative  to the extent that they are recognised and adopted by regulatory authorities

2,63,       Financial Accounting Standards Board
3,63,The FASB and its predecessor organizations have been issuing financial reporting standards in  the United States since the     s  The FASB operates within a structure similar to that of the  IASB  The Financial Accounting Foundation oversees administers and finances the  organization  The Foundation ensures the independence of the standard setting process and  appoints members to the FASB and related entities including the Financial Accounting  Standards Advisory Council 
4,63,The FASB issues new and revised standards to improve standards of financial reporting so that  decision useful information is provided to users of financial reports  This is done through a  thorough and independent process that seeks input from stakeholders and is overseen by the  Financial Accounting Foundation  The steps in the process are similar to those described for the  IASB  The outputs of the standard setting process are contained in the FASB Accounting  Standards Codification   Codification    Effective for periods ending after    September       the Codification is the source of authoritative US generally accepted accounting  principles to be applied to non governmental entities  The Codification is organized by topic   Among the specific motivations for the Codification the FASB mentions that it will facilitate  researching accounting issues improve the usability of the literature provide accurate updated  information on an ongoing basis and help with convergence efforts 
5,63,US GAAP as established by the FASB is officially recognized as authoritative by the SEC   Financial Reporting Release No    Section     and reaffirmed in the April      Policy  Statement   However the SEC retains the authority to establish standards  Although it has  rarely overruled the FASB the SEC does issue authoritative financial reporting guidance  including Staff Accounting Bulletins  These bulletins reflect the SEC s views regarding  accounting related disclosure practices and can be found on the SEC website  Certain  portions but not all portions of the SEC regulations releases interpretations and guidance  are included for reference in the FASB Codification 
6,63,       Desirable Attributes of Accounting Standards Boards
7,63,The responsibilities of all parties involved in the standards setting process including trustees  of a foundation or others that oversee administer and finance the organization and members of  the standard setting board should be clearly defined  All parties involved in the standards  setting process should observe high professional standards including standards of ethics and  confidentiality  The organization should have adequate authority resources and competencies  to fulfill its responsibilities  The processes that guide the organization and the formation of  standards should be clear and consistent  The accounting standards board should be guided by a  well articulated framework with a clearly stated objective  The accounting standards board  should operate independently seeking and considering input from stakeholders but making  decisions that are consistent with the stated objective of the framework  The decision setting  process should not be compromised by pressure from external forces and should not be  influenced by self  or special interests  The decisions and resulting standards should be in the  public interest and culminate in a set of high quality standards that will be recognised and  adopted by regulatory authorities

2,64,     Regulatory Authorities
3,64,The requirement to prepare financial reports in accordance with specified accounting standards  is the responsibility of regulatory authorities  Regulatory authorities are governmental entities  that have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting requirements and exert other controls  over entities that participate in the capital markets within their jurisdiction  Regulatory  authorities may require that financial reports be prepared in accordance with one specific set of  accounting standards or may specify acceptable accounting standards  For example in  Switzerland Swiss based companies listed on the main board of the Swiss Exchange have to  prepare their financial statements in accordance with either IFRS or US GAAP if they are  multinational   Other registrants in Switzerland could use IFRS US GAAP or Swiss GAAP 
4,64,The International Organization of Securities Commissions  IOSCO  is not a regulatory  authority but its members regulate a significant portion of the world s financial capital markets   This organization has established objectives and principles to guide securities and capital  market regulation  The US SEC is discussed as an example of a regulatory authority  Aspects of  capital market regulation in Europe are discussed to illustrate a co operative approach to  regulation 
5,64,       International Organization of Securities Commissions
6,64,IOSCO was formed in      as the successor organization to an inter American regional  association  created in        As of    September      IOSCO had     ordinary members     associate members and    affiliate members  Ordinary members are the securities commission  or similar governmental regulatory authority with primary responsibility for securities  regulation in the country    The members regulate more than    percent of the world s financial  capital markets 
7,64,The IOSCO s comprehensive set of Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation is  updated as required and is recognized as an international benchmark for all markets  The  principles of securities regulation are based upon three core objectives   
8,64,  protecting investors 
9,64,  ensuring that markets are fair efficient and transparent  and
10,64,  reducing systemic risk 
11,64,IOSCO s principles are grouped into nine categories including principles for regulators for  enforcement for auditing and for issuers among others  Within the category  Principles for  Issuers  two principles relate directly to financial reporting 
12,64,  There should be full accurate and timely disclosure of financial results risk and other  information which is material to investors  decisions 
13,64,  Accounting standards used by issuers to prepare financial statements should be of a high  and internationally acceptable quality

2,65,Historically regulation and related financial reporting standards were developed within  individual countries and were often based on the cultural economic and political norms of each  country  As financial markets have become more global it has become desirable to establish  comparable financial reporting standards internationally  Ultimately laws and regulations are  established by individual jurisdictions so this also requires cooperation among regulators   Another IOSCO principle deals with the use of self regulatory organizations  accounting  standards bodies are examples of self regulating organizations in this context   Principle    states 
3,65,Where the regulatory system makes use of Self Regulatory Organizations  SROs   that exercise some direct oversight responsibility for their respective areas of  competence such SROs should be subject to the oversight of the Regulator and  should observe standards of fairness and confidentiality when exercising powers  and delegated responsibilities   
4,65,To ensure consistent application of international financial standards  such as the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision s standards and IFRS  it is important to have uniform  regulation and enforcement across national boundaries  IOSCO assists in attaining this goal of  uniform regulation as well as cross border co operation in combating violations of securities  and derivatives laws 
5,65,       The Securities and Exchange Commission  US 
6,65,The US SEC has primary responsibility for securities and capital markets regulation in the  United States and is an ordinary member of IOSCO  Any company issuing securities within the  United States or otherwise involved in US capital markets is subject to the rules and  regulations of the SEC  The SEC one of the oldest and most developed regulatory authorities  originated as a result of reform efforts made after the great stock market crash of       sometimes referred to as simply the  Great Crash  
7,65,A number of laws affect reporting companies broker dealers and other market participants   From a financial reporting and analysis perspective the most significant pieces of legislation  are the Securities Acts of      and      and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of

2,66,  Sarbanes Oxley Act of       The Sarbanes Oxley Act of      created the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board  PCAOB  to oversee auditors  The SEC is  responsible for carrying out the requirements of the act and overseeing the PCAOB  The  act addresses auditor independence  for example it prohibits auditors from providing  certain non audit services to the companies they audit  The act strengthens corporate  responsibility for financial reports  for example it requires the chief executive officer and  the chief financial officer to certify that the company s financial reports fairly present the  company s condition  Furthermore Section     of the Sarbanes Oxley Act requires  management to report on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over  financial reporting and to obtain a report from its external auditor attesting to  management s assertion about the effectiveness of the company s internal control 
3,66,Companies comply with these acts principally through the completion and submission  i e   filing  of standardized forms issued by the SEC  There are more than    different types of SEC  forms that are used to satisfy reporting requirements  the discussion herein will be limited to  those forms most relevant for financial analysts 
4,66,In      the SEC began to mandate electronic filings of the required forms through its  Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval  EDGAR  system  As of      most SEC  filings are required to be made electronically  EDGAR has made corporate and financial  information more readily available to investors and the financial community  Most of the SEC  filings that an analyst would be interested in can be retrieved from the internet from one of  many websites including the SEC s own website  Some filings are required on the initial  offering of securities whereas others are required on a periodic basis thereafter  The following  are some of the more common information sources used by analysts 
5,66,  Securities Offerings Registration Statement  The      Act requires companies  offering securities to file a registration statement  New issuers as well as previously  registered companies that are issuing new securities are required to file these statements   Required information and the precise form vary depending upon the size and nature of the  offering  Typically required information includes     disclosures about the securities  being offered for sale    the relationship of these new securities to the issuer s other  capital securities    the information typically provided in the annual filings    recent  audited financial statements and    risk factors involved in the business 
6,66,  Forms    K    F and    F  These are forms that companies are required to file  annually  Form    K is for US registrants Form    F is for certain Canadian registrants  and Form    F is for all other non US registrants  These forms require a comprehensive  overview including information concerning a company s business financial disclosures  legal proceedings and information related to management  The financial disclosures  include a historical summary of financial data  usually    years  management s  discussion and analysis  MD A  of the company s financial condition and results of  operations and audited financial statements

2,67,  Annual Report  In addition to the SEC s annual filings  e g  Form    K  most  companies prepare an annual report to shareholders  This is not a requirement of the SEC   The annual report is usually viewed as one of the most significant opportunities for a  company to present itself to shareholders and other external parties  accordingly it is  often a highly polished marketing document with photographs an opening letter from the  chief executive officer financial data market segment information research and  development activities and future corporate goals  In contrast the Form    K is a more  legal type of document with minimal marketing emphasis  Although the perspectives  vary there is considerable overlap between a company s annual report and its Form     K  Some companies elect to prepare just the Form    K or a document that integrates  both the    K and annual report 
3,67,  Proxy Statement Form DEF   A  The SEC requires that shareholders of a company  receive a proxy statement prior to a shareholder meeting  A proxy is an authorization  from the shareholder giving another party the right to cast its vote  Shareholder meetings  are held at least once a year but any special meetings also require a proxy statement   Proxies especially annual meeting proxies contain information that is often useful to  financial analysts  Such information typically includes proposals that require a  shareholder vote details of security ownership by management and principal owners  biographical information on directors and disclosure of executive compensation  Proxy  statement information is filed with the SEC as Form DEF   A 
4,67,  Forms    Q and   K  These are forms that companies are required to submit for interim  periods  quarterly for US companies on Form    Q semiannually for many non US  companies on Form   K   The filing requires certain financial information including  unaudited financial statements and a MD A for the interim period covered by the report   Additionally if certain types of non recurring events such as the adoption of a  significant accounting policy commencement of significant litigation or a material  limitation on the rights of any holders of any class of registered securities take place  during the period covered by the report these events must be included in the Form    Q  report  Companies may provide the    Q report to shareholders or may prepare a  separate abbreviated quarterly report to shareholders

6,67,Initial Registration Statement
7,67,In      Google filed a Form S   registration statement with the US SEC to register its  initial public offering of securities  Class A Common Stock   In addition to a large  amount of financial and business information the registration statement provided a     page discussion of risks related to Google s business and industry  This type of  qualitative information is helpful if not essential in making an assessment of a  company s credit or investment risk 
8,67,Which of the following is least likely to have been included in Google s registration  statement 
9,67,A  Audited financial statements 
10,67,B  Assessment of risk factors involved in the business 
11,67,C  Projected cash flows and earnings for the business

2,68,Solution 
3,68,C is correct  Companies provide information useful in developing these projections but  do not typically include these in the registration statement  Information provided  includes audited financial statements an assessment of risk factors involved in the  business names of the underwriters estimated proceeds from the offering and use of  proceeds 
4,68,A company or its officers make other SEC filings either periodically or if significant events  or transactions have occurred in between the periodic reports noted above  By their nature  these forms sometimes contain the most interesting and timely information and may have  significant valuation implications 
5,68,  Form   K  In addition to filing annual and interim reports SEC registrants must report  material corporate events on a more current basis  Form   K    K for non US registrants   is the  current report  companies must file with the SEC to announce such major events  as acquisitions or disposals of corporate assets changes in securities and trading markets  matters related to accountants and financial statements corporate governance and  management changes and Regulation FD disclosures   
6,68,  Form      This form must be filed with the SEC as notice of the proposed sale of  restricted securities or securities held by an affiliate of the issuer in reliance on Rule       Rule     permits limited sales of restricted securities without registration 
7,68,  Forms     and    These forms are required to report beneficial ownership of securities   These filings are required for any director or officer of a registered company as well as  beneficial owners of greater than    percent of a class of registered equity securities   Form   is the initial statement Form   reports changes and Form   is the annual report   These forms along with Form     can be used to examine purchases and sales of  securities by officers directors and other affiliates of the company 
8,68,  Form    K  This is the annual report of employee stock purchase savings and similar  plans  It might be of interest to analysts for companies with significant employee benefit  plans because it contains more information than that disclosed in the company s financial  statements 
9,68,In jurisdictions other than the United States similar legislation exists for the purpose of  regulating securities and capital markets  Regulatory authorities are responsible for enforcing  regulation and securities regulation is intended to be consistent with the IOSCO objectives  described in the previous section  Within each jurisdiction regulators will either establish or  more typically recognize and adopt a specified set or sets of accounting standards  The  regulators will also establish reporting and filing requirements  IOSCO members have agreed to  cooperate in the development implementation and enforcement of internationally recognised  and consistent standards of regulation

2,69,       Capital Markets Regulation in Europe
3,69,Each individual member state of the European Union  EU  regulates capital markets in its  jurisdiction  There are however certain regulations that have been adopted at the EU level   Importantly in      the EU agreed that from   January      consolidated accounts of EU  listed companies would use International Financial Reporting Standards  The endorsement  process by which newly issued IFRS are adopted by the EU reflects the balance between the  individual member state s autonomy and the need for cooperation and convergence  When the  IASB issues a new standard the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group advises the  European Commission on the standard and the Standards Advice Review Group provides the  Commission an opinion about that advice  Based on the input from these two entities the  Commission prepares a draft endorsement regulation  The Accounting Regulatory Committee  votes on the proposal  and if the vote is favorable the proposal proceeds to the European  Parliament and the Council of the European Union for approval   
4,69,Two committees related to securities regulation established in      by the European  Commission are the European Securities Committee  ESC  and the Committee of European  Securities Regulators  CESR   The ESC consists of high level representatives of member states  and advises the European Commission on securities policy issues  The CESR an independent  advisory body composed of representatives of regulatory authorities of the member states  assists the commission particularly with technical issues  As noted earlier regulation still rests  with the individual member states and therefore requirements for registering shares and filing  periodic financial reports vary from country to country 
5,69,On   January      CESR was replaced by the European Securities and Market Authority   ESMA  as part of a reform of the EU financial supervisory framework  The EU Parliament  created ESMA as an EU cross border supervisor because the CESR s powers were deemed  insufficient to co ordinate supervision of the EU market  ESMA is one of three European  supervisory authorities  the two others supervise the banking and insurance industries 
6,69,   CONVERGENCE OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL  REPORTING STANDARDS
7,69,Activities in the early part of the   st century have moved the goal of one set of universally  accepted financial reporting standards out of the theoretical sphere and closer to reality  IFRS  have been or are in the process of being adopted in many countries  Other countries maintain  their own set of standards but are working with the IASB to converge their standards and IFRS

2,70,In some ways the movement toward one global set of financial reporting standards has made  the challenges related to full convergence or adoption of a single set of global standards more  apparent  Standard setting bodies and regulators can have differing views or use a different  framework for developing standards  This can be the result of differences in institutional  regulatory business and cultural environments  In addition there may be resistance to change  or advocacy for change from certain constituents  accounting boards may be influenced by  strong industry lobbying groups and others that will be subject to these reporting standards  For  example the FASB faced strong opposition when it first attempted to adopt standards requiring  companies to expense employee stock compensation plans    The IASB has experienced  similar political pressures  The issue of political pressure is compounded when international  standards are involved simply because there are many more interested parties and many more  divergent views and objectives  In the financial crisis of      and      both the FASB and the  IASB faced political pressure to amend the standards related to financial instrument accounting   Political pressure and its influence create tension as the independence of accounting standards  boards are questioned and jeopardized 
3,70,The integrity of the financial reporting framework depends on the standard setter s ability to  invite and balance various points of view and yet to remain independent of external pressures   For analysts it is important to be aware of the pace of change in accounting standards and  factors potentially influencing those changes 
4,70,An additional issue related to convergence involves the application and enforcement of  accounting standards  Unless the standards are applied consistently and enforcement is uniform  a single set of standards may only appear to exist but desirable attributes such as comparability  may be lacking 
5,70,In      the IASB and FASB each acknowledged their commitment to the development of high  quality compatible accounting standards that could be used for both domestic and cross border  financial reporting  in an agreement referred to as  the Norwalk Agreement    Both the IASB  and FASB pledged to use their best efforts to    make their existing financial reporting  standards fully compatible as soon as practicable and    to coordinate their future work  programs to ensure that once achieved compatibility is maintained  The Norwalk Agreement  was certainly an important milestone and both bodies began working toward convergence  In       the IASB and FASB agreed that in principle any significant accounting standard would  be developed cooperatively  In      the IASB and the FASB issued another memorandum of  understanding  titled  A Roadmap for Convergence between IFRSs and US GAAP   in which  the two Boards identified major projects  They agreed to align their conceptual frameworks  in  the short term to remove selected differences  and in the medium term to issue joint standards  where significant improvements were identified as being required  The joint projects include   but are not limited to   the Conceptual Framework Fair Value Measurement Consolidations  Financial Instruments Financial Statement Presentation Insurance Contracts Leases Post  Employment Benefits and Revenue Recognition  In      the IASB and FASB again  reaffirmed their commitment to achieving convergence and affirmed June      as the target  completion date for the major projects that had been identified  In mid      however the  Boards acknowledged that all the new standard setting activity required to achieve that targeted  completion would not give stakeholders enough time to provide high quality input in the  process  Therefore the Boards pushed back the target date for some projects to later in

2,71,In April      the IASB and the FASB published a joint report in which they described the  progress made on financial instruments  This was followed in February      when the IASB  and FASB published a high level update on the status and timetable of the remaining  convergence projects  The convergence project was completed when the IASB and FASB  issued their standards on lease accounting in       As of year end      no new projects are  expected for the IASB FASB convergence initiative 
3,71,When convergence between IFRS and US GAAP was occurring the SEC began certain steps  regarding the possible adoption of IFRS in the United States  Effective in      the SEC  adopted rules to eliminate the reconciliation requirement for foreign private issuers  financial  statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB  Previously any non US  issuer using accounting standards other than US GAAP was required to provide a reconciliation  to US GAAP  In November      the SEC issued a proposed rule concerning a  Roadmap  for  the use of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS by US issuers  however the  rule did not become final  In February      the SEC issued a  Statement in Support of  Convergence and Global Accounting Standards  in which it reiterated its commitment to global  accounting standards and directed its staff to execute a work plan to enable the  Commission in       to make a determination regarding incorporating IFRS into the financial reporting system  for US issuers     By the end of      convergence efforts by the IASB and the FASB largely  ceased 
4,71,Convergence between IFRS and other local GAAP also continued through       For example  convergence between IFRS and Japanese GAAP is underway  In      the IASB and the  Accounting Standards Board of Japan published a memorandum of understanding  the  Tokyo  Agreement   outlining work to achieve convergence by June       In      the Japanese  Business Accounting Council a key advisory body to the Commissioner of the Japanese  Financial Services Agency approved a roadmap for the adoption of IFRS in Japan    Since       eligible listed companies in Japan have been permitted to use IFRS in place of Japanese  GAAP in their consolidated financial statements as designated by the FSA 
5,71,Exhibit   provides a summary of the adoption status of IFRS in selected worldwide locations   As can be seen adoption ranges from total adoption of IFRS to requiring local GAAP  Between  these two extremes countries demonstrate different levels of commitment to IFRS including  adoption of a local version of IFRS requirement for certain entities to use IFRS permission to  use IFRS and use of local GAAP that is converging with IFRS

2,78,The providers of resources are considered to be the primary users of financial reports and  include investors lenders and other creditors  The purpose of providing the financial  information is to be useful in making decisions about providing resources  Other users may find  the financial information useful for making economic decisions  The types of economic  decisions differ by users so the specific information needed differs as well  However although  these users may have unique information needs some information needs are common across all  users  Information is needed about the company s financial position  its resources and its  financial obligations  Information is needed about a company s financial performance  this  information explains how and why the company s financial position changed in the past and can  be useful in evaluating potential changes in the future  The third common information need  reflected in the Conceptual Framework        diagram is the need for information about a  company s cash  How did the company obtain cash  by selling its products and services  borrowing other   How did the company use cash  by paying expenses investing in new  equipment paying dividends other  
3,78,The Conceptual Framework        indicates that to make decisions about providing resources  to the company users need information that is helpful in assessing future net cash inflows to the  entity  Such information includes information about the economic resources of  assets  and  claims against  liabilities and equity  the entity and about how well the management and  governing board have utilized the resources of the entity  It is specifically noted in the  Conceptual Framework        that users need to consider information from other sources as  well in making their decisions  Further it is noted that the financial reports do not show the  value of an entity but are useful in estimating the value of an entity 
4,78,     Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reports
5,78,Flowing from the central objective of providing information that is useful to providers of  resources the Conceptual Framework        elaborates on what constitutes usefulness  It  identifies two fundamental qualitative characteristics that make financial information useful   relevance and faithful representation    The concept of materiality is discussed within the  context of relevance 
6,78,   Relevance  Information is relevant if it would potentially affect or make a difference in  users  decisions  The information can have predictive value  useful in making forecasts   confirmatory value  useful to evaluate past decisions or forecasts  or both  In other  words relevant information helps users of financial information to evaluate past present  and future events or to confirm or correct their past evaluations in a decision making  context  Materiality  Information is considered to be material if omission or misstatement  of the information could influence users  decisions  Materiality is a function of the nature  and or magnitude of the information 
7,78,   Faithful representation  Information that faithfully represents an economic phenomenon  that it purports to represent is ideally complete neutral and free from error  Complete  means that all information necessary to understand the phenomenon is depicted  Neutral  means that information is selected and presented without bias  In other words the  information is not presented in such a manner as to bias the users  decisions  Free from  error means that there are no errors of commission or omission in the description of the  economic phenomenon and that an appropriate process to arrive at the reported  information was selected and was adhered to without error  Faithful representation  maximizes the qualities of complete neutral and free from error to the extent possible

2,79,Relevance and faithful representation are the fundamental most critical characteristics of useful  financial information  In addition to these two fundamental characteristics the Conceptual  Framework        identifies four characteristics that enhance the usefulness of relevant and  faithfully represented financial information  These enhancing qualitative characteristics are  comparability verifiability timeliness and understandability   
3,79,   Comparability  Comparability allows users  to identify and understand similarities and  differences of items   Information presented in a consistent manner over time and across  entities enables users to make comparisons more easily than information with variations  in how similar economic phenomena are represented 
4,79,   Verifiability  Verifiability means that different knowledgeable and independent observers  would agree that the information presented faithfully represents the economic phenomena  it purports to represent 
5,79,   Timeliness  Timely information is available to decision makers prior to their making a  decision 
6,79,   Understandability  Clear and concise presentation of information enhances  understandability  The Conceptual Framework        specifies that the information is  prepared for and should be understandable by users who have a reasonable knowledge of  business and economic activities and who are willing to study the information with  diligence  However some complex economic phenomena cannot be presented in an  easily understandable form  Information that is useful should not be excluded simply  because it is difficult to understand  It may be necessary for users to seek assistance to  understand information about complex economic phenomena 
7,79,Financial information exhibiting these qualitative characteristics fundamental and  enhancing should be useful for making economic decisions 
8,79,     Constraints on Financial Reports
9,79,Although it would be ideal for financial statements to exhibit all of these qualitative  characteristics and thus achieve maximum usefulness it may be necessary to make tradeoffs  across the enhancing characteristics  The application of the enhancing characteristics follows no  set order of priority  Depending on the circumstances each enhancing characteristic may take  priority over the others    The aim is an appropriate balance among the enhancing  characteristics 
10,79,A pervasive constraint on useful financial reporting is the cost of providing and using this  information    Optimally benefits derived from information should exceed the costs of  providing and using it  Again the aim is a balance between costs and benefits 
11,79,A limitation of financial reporting not specifically mentioned in the Conceptual Framework        involves information not included  Financial statements by necessity omit information  that is non quantifiable  For example the creativity innovation and competence of a  company s work force are not directly captured in the financial statements  Similarly customer  loyalty a positive corporate culture environmental responsibility and many other aspects about  a company may not be directly reflected in the financial statements  Of course to the extent that  these items result in superior financial performance a company s financial reports will reflect  the results

2,80,EXAMPLE  
3,80,Balancing Qualitative Characteristics of  Useful Information
4,80,A tradeoff between enhancing qualitative characteristics often occurs  For example  when a company records sales revenue it is required to simultaneously estimate and  record an expense for potential bad debts  uncollectible accounts   Including this  estimated expense is considered to represent the economic event faithfully and to  provide relevant information about the net profits for the accounting period  The  information is timely and understandable  but because bad debts may not be known with  certainty until a later period inclusion of this estimated expense involves a sacrifice of  verifiability  The bad debt expense is simply an estimate  It is apparent that it is not  always possible to simultaneously fulfill all qualitative characteristics 
5,80,Companies are most likely to make tradeoffs between which of the following when  preparing financial reports 
6,80,A  Relevance and materiality 
7,80,B  Timeliness and verifiability 
8,80,C  Relevance and faithful representation 
9,80,Solution 
10,80,B is correct  Providing timely information implies a shorter time frame between the  economic event and the information preparation  however fully verifying information  may require a longer time frame  Relevance and faithful representation are fundamental  qualitative characteristics that make financial information useful  Both characteristics  are required  there is no tradeoff between these  Materiality is an aspect of relevance 
11,80,     The Elements of Financial Statements
12,80,Financial statements portray the financial effects of transactions and other events by grouping  them into broad classes  elements  according to their economic characteristics    Three  elements of financial statements are directly related to the measurement of financial position   assets liabilities and equity   
13,80,  Assets  Resources controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which  future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise  Assets are what a  company owns  e g  inventory and equipment  
14,80,  Liabilities  Present obligations of an enterprise arising from past events the settlement of  which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits   Liabilities are what a company owes  e g  bank borrowings

2,81,  Equity  for public companies also known as  shareholders  equity  or  stockholders   equity    Assets less liabilities  Equity is the residual interest in the assets after  subtracting the liabilities 
3,81,The elements of financial statements directly related to the measurement of performance  profit  and related measures  are income and expenses   
4,81,  Income  Increases in economic benefits in the form of inflows or enhancements of  assets or decreases of liabilities that result in an increase in equity  other than increases  resulting from contributions by owners   Income includes both revenues and gains   Revenues represent income from the ordinary activities of the enterprise  e g  the sale of  products   Gains may result from ordinary activities or other activities  the sale of surplus  equipment  
5,81,  Expenses  Decreases in economic benefits in the form of outflows or depletions of  assets or increases in liabilities that result in decreases in equity  other than decreases  because of distributions to owners   Expenses include losses as well as those items  normally thought of as expenses such as the cost of goods sold or wages 
6,81,       Underlying Assumptions in Financial Statements
7,81,Two important assumptions underlie financial statements  accrual accounting and going  concern  These assumptions determine how financial statement elements are recognized and  measured   
8,81,The use of  accrual accounting  assumes that financial statements should reflect transactions in  the period when they actually occur not necessarily when cash movements occur  For example  accrual accounting specifies that a company reports revenues when they are earned  when the  performance obligations have been satisfied  regardless of whether the company received cash  before delivering the product after delivering the product or at the time of delivery 
9,81, Going concern  refers to the assumption that the company will continue in business for the  foreseeable future  To illustrate consider the value of a company s inventory if it is assumed  that the inventory can be sold over a normal period of time versus the value of that same  inventory if it is assumed that the inventory must all be sold in a day  or a week   Companies  with the intent to liquidate or materially curtail operations would require different information  for a fair presentation 
10,81,In reporting the financial position of a company that is assumed to be a going concern it may  be appropriate to list assets at some measure of a current value based upon normal market  conditions  However if a company is expected to cease operations and be liquidated it may be  more appropriate to list such assets at an appropriate liquidation value namely a value that  would be obtained in a forced sale 
11,81,       Recognition of Financial Statement Elements
12,81,Recognition means that an item is included in the balance sheet or income statement   Recognition occurs if the item meets the definition of an element and satisfies the criteria for  recognition  A financial statement element  assets liabilities equity income and expenses   should be recognized in the financial statements if

2,82,  it is probable that any future economic benefit associated with the item will flow to or  from the enterprise  and
3,82,  the item has a cost or value that can be measured with reliability 
4,82,       Measurement of Financial Statement Elements
5,82,Measurement is the process of determining the monetary amounts at which the elements of the  financial statements are to be recognized and carried in the balance sheet and income statement   The following alternative bases of measurement are used to different degrees and in varying  combinations to measure assets and liabilities   
6,82,  Historical cost  Historical cost is simply the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid to  purchase an asset including any costs of acquisition and or preparation  If the asset was  not bought for cash historical cost is the fair value of whatever was given in order to buy  the asset  When referring to liabilities the historical cost basis of measurement means the  amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation 
7,82,  Amortised cost  Historical cost adjusted for amortisation depreciation or depletion  and or impairment 
8,82,  Current cost  In reference to assets current cost is the amount of cash or cash  equivalents that would have to be paid to buy the same or an equivalent asset today  In  reference to liabilities the current cost basis of measurement means the undiscounted  amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation today 
9,82,  Realizable  settlement  value  In reference to assets realizable value is the amount of  cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the asset in an orderly  disposal  For liabilities the equivalent to realizable value is called  settlement  value  that is settlement value is the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents  expected to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business 
10,82,  Present value  PV   For assets present value is the present discounted value of the  future net cash inflows that the asset is expected to generate in the normal course of  business  For liabilities present value is the present discounted value of the future net  cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course  of business 
11,82,  Fair value  is a measure of value mentioned but not specifically defined in the  Conceptual Framework         Fair value is defined in IFRS and US GAAP as an exit  price the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  This may  involve either market measures or present value measures depending on the availability  of information

2,83,     General Requirements for Financial Statements
3,83,The Conceptual Framework        provides a basis for establishing standards and the elements  of financial statements but it does not address the contents of the financial statements  Having  discussed the Conceptual Framework        we now address the general requirements for  financial statements 
4,83,International Accounting Standard  IAS  No    Presentation of Financial Statements specifies  the required financial statements general features of financial statements and structure and  content of financial statements    These general requirements are illustrated in Exhibit   and  described in the subsections below 
5,83,Exhibit    IASB General Requirements for Financial Statements
6,83,In the following sections we discuss the required financial statements the general features  underlying the preparation of financial statements and the specified structure and content in  greater detail 
7,83,       Required Financial Statements
8,83,Under IAS No    a complete set of financial statements includes   
9,83,  a statement of financial position  balance sheet

2,84,  a statement of changes in equity separately showing changes in equity resulting from  profit or loss each item of other comprehensive income and transactions with owners in  their capacity as owners   
3,84,  a statement of cash flows  and
4,84,  notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory  notes that disclose information required by IFRS and not presented elsewhere and that  provide information relevant to an understanding of the financial statements 
5,84,Entities are encouraged to furnish other related financial and non financial information in  addition to that required  Financial statements need to present fairly the financial position  financial performance and cash flows of an entity 
6,84,       General Features of Financial Statements
7,84,A company that applies IFRS is required to state explicitly in the notes to its financial  statements that it is in compliance with the standards  Such a statement is only made when a  company is in compliance with all requirements of IFRS  In extremely rare circumstances a  company may deviate from a requirement of IFRS if management concludes that complying  with IFRS would result in misleading financial statements  In this case management must  disclose details of the departure from IFRS 
8,84,IAS No    specifies a number of general features underlying the preparation of financial  statements  These features clearly reflect the Conceptual Framework        
9,84,  Fair Presentation  The application of IFRS is presumed to result in financial statements  that achieve a fair presentation  The IAS describes fair presentation as follows 
10,84,Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of  transactions other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions  and recognition criteria for assets liabilities income and expenses set out in  the Framework   
11,84,  Going Concern  Financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis unless  management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading or has no realistic  alternative but to do so  If not presented on a going concern basis the fact and rationale  should be disclosed 
12,84,  Accrual Basis  Financial statements  except for cash flow information  are to be prepared  using the accrual basis of accounting 
13,84,  Materiality and Aggregation  Omissions or misstatements of items are material if they  could individually or collectively influence the economic decisions that users make on  the basis of the financial statements  Each material class of similar items is presented  separately  Dissimilar items are presented separately unless they are immaterial 
14,84,  No Offsetting  Assets and liabilities and income and expenses are not offset unless  required or permitted by an IFRS 
15,84,  Frequency of Reporting  Financial statements must be prepared at least annually

2,85,  Comparative Information  Financial statements must include comparative information  from the previous period  The comparative information of prior periods is disclosed for  all amounts reported in the financial statements unless an IFRS requires or permits  otherwise 
3,85,  Consistency  The presentation and classification of items in the financial statements are  usually retained from one period to the next 
4,85,       Structure and Content Requirements
5,85,IAS No    also specifies structure and content of financial statements  These requirements  include the following 
6,85,  Classified Statement of Financial Position  Balance Sheet   IAS No    requires the  balance sheet to distinguish between current and non current assets and between current  and non current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant  and reliable information  e g  in the case of a bank or similar financial institution  
7,85,  Minimum Information on the Face of the Financial Statements  IAS No    specifies the  minimum line item disclosures on the face of or in the notes to the financial statements   For example companies are specifically required to disclose the amount of their plant  property and equipment as a line item on the face of the balance sheet  The specific  requirements are listed in Exhibit   
8,85,  Minimum Information in the Notes  or on the face of financial statements   IAS No     specifies disclosures about information to be presented in the financial statements  This  information must be provided in a systematic manner and cross referenced from the face  of the financial statements to the notes  The required information is summarized in
9,85,Exhibit   
10,85,  Comparative Information  For all amounts reported in a financial statement comparative  information should be provided for the previous period unless another standard requires  or permits otherwise  Such comparative information allows users to better understand  reported amounts

2,89,As more countries adopt IFRS the need to consider other financial reporting systems will be  reduced  Additionally the IASB and FASB are considering frameworks from other jurisdictions  in developing their joint framework  Nevertheless analysts are likely to encounter financial  statements that are prepared on a basis other than IFRS  Although the number and relevance of  different local GAAP reporting systems are likely to decline industry specific financial  reports such as those required for banking or insurance companies will continue to exist   Differences remain between IFRS and US GAAP that affect the framework and general  financial reporting requirements  The readings on individual financial statements and specific  topics will review in more detail differences in IFRS and US GAAP as they apply to specific  financial statements and topics 
3,89,As mentioned earlier a joint IASB FASB project was begun in October      to develop a  common conceptual framework  The initial focus was to achieve the convergence of the  frameworks and improve particular aspects of the framework dealing with objectives  qualitative characteristics elements and their recognition and measurement  A December       discussion paper presented the broad differences between the two frameworks  The differences  between IFRS and US GAAP that affect the framework and general financial reporting  requirements have been reduced by the agreement by the IASB and FASB on the purpose and  scope of the Conceptual Framework        the objective of general purpose financial  reporting and qualitative characteristics of useful financial information  Exhibit   summarizes  the remaining differences as presented in the December      discussion paper  Some of the  differences identified in December      may no longer apply  The readings on individual  financial statements and specific topics will discuss relevant and more current differences in  greater detail

6,89,US GAAP  FASB  Framework   Performance Elements  The FASB framework includes  three elements relating to financial performance in  addition to revenue and expenses  gains losses and  comprehensive income  Comprehensive income is a  more encompassing concept than net income as it  includes all changes in equity during a period except  those resulting from investments by and distributions  to owners 
7,89,  Financial Position Elements  The FASB framework  defines an asset as  a future economic benefit  rather  than the  resource  from which future economic  benefits are expected to flow to the entity as in the  IASB framework  It also includes the term  probable   to define the assets and liabilities elements  As  discussed below the term  probable  is part of the  IASB framework recognition criteria  Additionally the  frameworks have different meanings of probable

2,90,US GAAP  FASB  Framework   Recognition of Elements  The FASB framework does  not discuss the term  probable  in its recognition  criteria whereas the IASB framework requires that it is  probable that any future economic benefit flow to from  the entity  The FASB framework also has a separate  recognition criterion of relevance 
3,90,  Measurement of Elements  Measurement attributes   historical cost current cost settlement value current  market value and present value  are broadly consistent  and both frameworks lack fully developed  measurement concepts  Furthermore the FASB  framework prohibits revaluations except for certain  categories of financial instruments which have to be  carried at fair value 
4,90,For analysis of financial statements created under different frameworks reconciliation  schedules and disclosures regarding the significant differences between the reporting bases were  formerly available to a greater extent  For example the SEC used to require reconciliation for  foreign private issuers that did not prepare financial statements in accordance with US GAAP   The SEC no longer requires reconciliation for foreign private issuers that prepare their financial  reports in compliance with IFRS  Such reconciliations can reveal additional information related  to the more judgmental components of the financial statements  In the absence of a  reconciliation users of financial statements must be prepared to consider how the use of  different reporting standards potentially impact financial reports  This can have important  implications for comparing the performance of companies and security valuation 
5,90,   EFFECTIVE FINANCIAL REPORTING
6,90,A discussion of the characteristics of an effective framework and the barriers to the creation of  such a framework offer additional perspective on financial reporting 
7,90,     Characteristics of an Effective Financial Reporting  Framework
8,90,Any effective financial reporting system needs to be a coherent one  i e  a framework in which  all the pieces fit together according to an underlying logic   Such frameworks have several  characteristics

2,91,  Transparency  A framework should enhance the transparency of a company s financial  statements  Transparency means that users should be able to see the underlying  economics of the business reflected clearly in the company s financial statements  Full  disclosure and fair presentation create transparency 
3,91,  Comprehensiveness  To be comprehensive a framework should encompass the full  spectrum of transactions that have financial consequences  This spectrum includes not  only transactions currently occurring but also new types of transactions as they are  developed  So an effective financial reporting framework is based on principles that are  universal enough to provide guidance for recording both existing and newly developed  transactions 
4,91,  Consistency  An effective framework should ensure reasonable consistency across  companies and time periods  In other words similar transactions should be measured and  presented in a similar manner regardless of industry company size geography or other  characteristics  Balanced against this need for consistency however is the need for  sufficient flexibility to allow companies sufficient discretion to report results in  accordance with underlying economic activity 
5,91,     Barriers to a Single Coherent Framework
6,91,Although effective frameworks all share the characteristics of transparency comprehensiveness  and consistency there are some conflicts that create inherent limitations in any financial  reporting standards framework  Specifically it is difficult to completely satisfy all these  characteristics concurrently so any framework represents an attempt to balance the relative  importance of these characteristics  Three areas of conflict include valuation standard setting  approach and measurement 
7,91,  Valuation  As discussed various bases for measuring the value of assets and liabilities  exist such as historical cost current cost fair value realizable value and present value   Historical cost valuation under which an asset s value is its initial cost requires minimal  judgment  In contrast other valuation approaches such as fair value require considerable  judgment but can provide more relevant information 
8,91,  Standard Setting Approach  Financial reporting standards can be established based on     principles    rules or    a combination of principles and rules  sometimes referred to as   objectives oriented    A principles based approach provides a broad financial reporting  framework with little specific guidance on how to report a particular element or  transaction  Such principles based approaches require the preparers of financial reports  and auditors to exercise considerable judgment in financial reporting  In contrast a rules  based approach establishes specific rules for each element or transaction  Rules based  approaches are characterized by a list of yes or no rules specific numerical tests for  classifying certain transactions  known as  bright line tests   exceptions and alternative  treatments  Some suggest that rules are created in response to preparers  needs for  specific guidance in implementing principles so even standards that begin purely as  principles evolve into a combination of principles and rules  The third alternative an  objectives oriented approach combines the other two approaches by including both a  framework of principles and appropriate levels of implementation guidance  The common  conceptual framework is likely to be more objectives oriented

2,92,  Measurement  The balance sheet presents elements at a point in time whereas the income  statement reflects changes during a period of time  Because these statements are related  standards regarding one of the statements have an effect on the other statement  Financial  reporting standards can be established taking an  asset liability  approach which gives  preference to proper valuation of the balance sheet or a  revenue expense  approach that  focuses more on the income statement  This conflict can result in one statement being  reported in a theoretically sound manner but the other statement reflecting less relevant  information  Standard setters are now predominantly using an asset liability approach 
3,92,EXAMPLE  
4,92,Conflicts between Measurement Approaches
5,92,Prime Retailers  PR  a US based distributor of men s shirts has a policy of marking its  merchandise up by    per unit  At the beginning of      PR had       units of  inventory on hand which cost     per unit  During      PR purchased        units of  inventory at a cost of     per unit  Also during      PR sold        units of inventory  at     per unit  How shall PR reflect the cost of the inventory sold      or     or some  combination 
6,92,In order to match current costs with current revenues PR  which does not operate in an  IFRS jurisdiction  last in first out is not allowed under IFRS  may decide that it is  appropriate to use a method of inventory costing that assumes that the most recently  purchased inventory is sold first  So the assumption is that the        units of sales  had a cost of      A partial income statement for PR would be 
7,92,Sales          Cost of sales          Gross profit        
8,92,The gross profit calculated in this manner reflects the current cost of goods matched  with the current level of revenues 
9,92,But PR still has       units of inventory on hand  The assumption must be that the        remaining units had a cost of     per unit  Therefore the value of the inventory  reflected on the balance sheet would be         
10,92,Although the income statement reflects current costs the remaining inventory on the  balance sheet does not reflect current information  The inventory is reflected at the older  cost of     per unit  An analyst would likely find this older cost less relevant than the  current cost of that inventory

2,93,The adoption of IFRS as the required financial reporting standard by the EU and other countries  has advanced the goal of global convergence  Nevertheless there are still significant differences  in financial reporting in the global capital markets  Arguably the most critical are the  differences that exist between IFRS and US GAAP  After the EU adoption of IFRS in      a  significant number of the world s listed companies use one of these two reporting standards 
3,93,For analyzing financial statements created under different standards reconciliation schedules  and disclosures regarding the significant differences between the reporting bases historically  available in some jurisdictions were particularly helpful  For example the SEC historically  required reconciliation for foreign private issuers that did not prepare financial statements in  accordance with US GAAP  In      however the SEC eliminated the reconciliation  requirement for companies that prepared their financial statements according to IFRS   
4,93,Although the disclosures related to any such differences were sometimes dauntingly long the  numerical reconciliations of net income and shareholders  equity appeared in charts that were  relatively easy to use  As an example consider the reconciliation disclosures made by Syngenta  AG a Swiss agribusiness company in      the last year in which reconciliations were  required  Syngenta s      US SEC Form    F filing discussed these differences in Note      Significant Differences between IFRS and United States Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles   This note was roughly    pages long  The chart presenting the numerical  reconciliation of net income  see Exhibit    was however relatively easy to use and could be  reviewed to identify the significant items  large amounts could be examined in more detail  The  Syngenta disclosure indicates that the company s      net income based on US GAAP was       million compared with the      million of net income reported under IFRS  The  reconciliation indicates that most significant differences relate to accounting for acquisitions   purchase accounting adjustments include a     million increase and an     million decrease   accounting for pension provisions      million  accounting for put options      million  and  accounting for various tax related items  In some instances further analysis would be  undertaken to determine the implications of each significant difference based on additional  disclosures in the notes

6,94,Now that reconciliation disclosures are no longer generally available an analyst comparing two  companies that use different reporting standards must be aware of areas where accounting  standards have not converged  For example data from      SEC reconciliations  the last year  available  indicated that pensions and goodwill were the dominant IFRS to US GAAP  reconciliation items for European companies that listed their stock on an exchange in the United  States    In most cases a user of financial statements prepared under different accounting  standards will no longer have enough information to make specific adjustments required to  achieve comparability  Instead an analyst must maintain general caution in interpreting  comparative financial measures produced under different accounting standards and monitor  significant developments in financial reporting standards

4,96,   MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN FINANCIAL  REPORTING STANDARDS
5,96,In studying financial reporting and financial statement analysis in general the analyst must be  aware that reporting standards are evolving rapidly  Analysts need to monitor ongoing  developments in financial reporting and assess their implications for security analysis and  valuation  The need to monitor developments in financial reporting standards does not mean  that analysts should be accountants  An accountant monitors these developments from a  preparer s perspective  an analyst needs to monitor from a user s perspective  More specifically  analysts need to know how these developments will affect financial reports 
6,96,Analysts can remain aware of developments in financial reporting standards by monitoring  three areas  new products or transactions actions of standard setters and other groups  representing users of financial statements  such as CFA Institute  and company disclosures  regarding critical accounting policies and estimates 
7,96,     New Products or Types of Transactions
8,96,New products and new types of transactions can have unusual or unique elements to them such  that no explicit guidance in the financial reporting standards exists  New products or  transactions typically arise from economic events such as new businesses  e g  the internet  or  from a newly developed financial instrument or financial structure  Financial instruments  whether exchange traded or not are typically designed to enhance a company s business or to  mitigate inherent risks  However at times financial instruments or structured transactions have  been developed primarily for purposes of financial report  window dressing  
9,96,Although companies might discuss new products and transactions in their financial reports the  analyst can also monitor business journals and the capital markets to identify such items   Additionally when one company in an industry develops a new product or transaction other  companies in the industry often do the same  Once new products financial instruments or  structured transactions are identified it is helpful to gain an understanding of the business  purpose  If necessary an analyst can obtain further information from a company s management  which should be able to describe the economic purpose the financial statement reporting  significant estimates judgments applied in determining the reporting and future cash flow  implications for these items  The financial reporting framework described here is useful in  evaluating the potential effect on financial statements even though a standard may not have  been issued as to how to report a particular transaction

2,97,     Evolving Standards and the Role of CFA Institute
3,97,The actions of standard setters and regulators are unlikely to be helpful in identifying new  products and transactions given the lag between new product development and regulatory  action  Monitoring the actions of these authorities is nonetheless important for another reason   Changes in regulations can affect companies  financial reports and thus valuations  This is  particularly true if the financial reporting standards change to require more explicit  identification of matters affecting asset liability valuation or financial performance  For  example one regulatory change required companies to report the value of employee stock  options as an expense in the income statement  Prior to the required expensing an analyst could  assess the impact of stock options on a company s performance and the dilutive effect to  shareholders by reviewing information disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  As  another example the new standards on leases IFRS    which applies for annual reporting  periods beginning on   January      will result in explicitly recognizing on the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities associated with  operating leases   currently operating leases are not  recognized on the balance sheet and information concerning the lease is available only in the  notes  To the extent that some market participants do not examine financial statement details  and thus ignore some items when valuing a company s securities more explicit identification  could affect the value of the company s securities  Additionally it is plausible to believe that  management is more attentive to and rigorous in any calculations estimates of items that appear  in the financial statements compared to items that are only disclosed in the notes 
4,97,The IASB and FASB have numerous major projects underway that will most likely result in  new standards  It is important to keep up to date on these evolving standards  The IASB   www iasb org  and FASB  www fasb org  provide a great deal of information on their  websites regarding new standards and proposals for future changes in standards  In addition the  IASB and FASB seek input from the financial analyst community those who regularly use  financial statements in making investment and credit decisions  When a new standard is  proposed an exposure draft is made available and users of financial statements can draft  comment letters and position papers for submission to the IASB and FASB in order to evaluate  the proposal 
5,97,CFA Institute is active in advocating improvements to financial reporting through its Standards  and Financial Market Integrity Division  Volunteer members of CFA Institute serve on several  liaison committees that meet regularly to make recommendations to the IASB and FASB on  proposed standards and to draft comment letters and position papers  The comment letters and  position papers of these groups on financial reporting issues are available at
6,97,www cfainstitute org ethics topics pages index aspx 
7,97,CFA Institute issued a position paper titled A Comprehensive Business Reporting Model   Financial Reporting for Investors which provides a suggested model for significantly  improving financial reporting  The position paper issued in      states 
8,97,Corporate financial statements and their related disclosures are fundamental to  sound investment decision making  The well being of the world s financial  markets and of the millions of investors who entrust their financial present and  future to those markets depends directly on the information financial statements  and disclosures provide  Consequently the quality of the information drives global  financial markets  The quality in turn depends directly on the principles and  standards managers apply when recognizing and measuring the economic activities  and events affecting their companies  operations

2,98,Investors require timeliness transparency comparability and consistency in  financial reporting  Investors have a preference for decision relevance over  reliability  As CFA Institute stated in      and as reiterated in this paper  analysts  need to know economic reality what is really going on to the greatest extent it  can be depicted by accounting numbers   Corporate financial statements that fail to  reflect this economic reality undermine the investment decision making process   
3,98,Among other principles the proposed model stresses the importance of information regarding  the current fair value of assets and liabilities of neutrality in financial reporting and of  providing detailed information on cash flows to investors through the choice of the so called  direct format for the cash flow statement   
4,98,In summary analysts can improve their investment decision making by keeping current on  financial reporting standards and various web based sources provide the means to do so  In  addition analysts can contribute to improving financial reporting by sharing their perspective as  users with standard setting bodies which typically invite comments concerning proposed  changes 
5,98,     Company Disclosures
6,98,A good source for obtaining information regarding the effect of financial reporting standards on  a company s financial statements is typically the company itself  This information is provided  in the notes to the financial statements and accompanying discussion 
7,98,       Disclosures Relating to Critical and Significant Accounting Policies
8,98,As noted earlier financial reporting standards need to restrict alternatives but retain flexibility  in allowing enterprises to match their accounting methods with underlying economics  As a  result companies choose among alternative accounting policies  e g  depreciation methods   and use estimates  e g  depreciable lives of assets   Under both IFRS and US GAAP  companies are required to disclose their accounting policies and estimates in the notes to the  financial statements  Companies also discuss in the management commentary  or the  management s discussion and analysis MD A  those policies that management deems most  important  Although many of the policies are discussed in both the management commentary  and the notes to the financial statement there is typically a distinction between the two  discussions  The management commentary generally relates to aspects of the accounting  policies deemed important by management to understand the financial statements particularly  changes  The MD A disclosure relates to those policies that require significant judgments and  estimates whereas the note discusses all accounting policies irrespective of whether judgment  was required  Each disclosure has value 
9,98,In analyzing financial reporting disclosures the following questions should be addressed 
10,98,  What policies have been discussed 
11,98,  Do these policies appear to cover all of the significant balances on the financial  statements 
12,98,  Which policies are identified as requiring significant estimates

20,100,   the standard does not apply 
21,100,   the standard will have no material impact 
22,100,   management is still evaluating the impact  or

2,101,Clearly disclosures indicating the expected impact provide the most meaningful information  In  addition disclosures indicating that the standard does not apply or will not have a material  effect are also helpful  However disclosures indicating that management is still evaluating the  impact of a new standard create some uncertainty about whether the change might materially  affect the company 
3,101,In addition to the disclosures referred to in Exhibits    and    Volkswagen also provided  extensive disclosures about recently issued accounting standards in its      Annual Report  The  company confirmed it had adopted all accounting pronouncements required to be applied  starting in fiscal year      stated the impact of four new or revised standards and listed nine  other standards that had no material effect on the company s financial reports  In addition  Volkswagen provided a table summarizing standards that had been adopted by the IASB but  were not required to be applied for fiscal year       The table listed    specific standards  changes of which the company expected    to have no impact and the other three to result in  non quantified changes in disclosures or presentations 
4,101,In some cases companies are able to quantify the expected impact of accounting standards that  have been changed but are not yet effective at the time of the company s report  As an example  of quantified disclosures about accounting changes that would have a future effect on a  company s financial statements consider the disclosures in Exhibit    
5,101,Exhibit     Impact of New and Amended Accounting Standards  General  Electric
6,101,In its      annual report filed with the SEC in February      General Electric   which reports under US GAAP  included disclosures in its MD A about an  accounting change that would require consolidation of certain entities that previously  had not been consolidated  The acronym ASU stands for  Accounting Standards  Update  and is the means by which the FASB communicates changes to US GAAP  following the Financial Standards Codification in       The acronym ASC stands for   Accounting Standards Codification  and refers to a particular section of the  Codification 
7,101,In      the FASB issued ASU         and ASU         which  amended ASC     Transfers and Servicing and ASC      Consolidation respectively and are effective for us on January         
8,101,Upon adoption of the amendments on January        we will  consolidate the assets and liabilities of these entities at the amount they  would have been reported in our financial statements had we always  consolidated them  We will also deconsolidate certain entities where we  do not meet the definition of the primary beneficiary under the revised  guidance the effect of which will be insignificant  The incremental effect  of consolidation on total assets and liabilities net of our investment in  these entities will be an increase of approximately     billion and      billion respectively  There also will be a net reduction of equity of  approximately    billion principally related to the reversal of previously  recognized securitization gains as a cumulative effect adjustment to  retained earnings which will be earned back over the life of the assets

3,102,An analyst could use these disclosures to adjust expectations about the company s assets  liabilities and equity and confirm the impact  which in this case appear to be minimal  on the  company s leverage ratios  Importantly because these disclosures relate to expected changes  the analyst could incorporate these disclosures into forecasts of financial statements 
4,102,SUMMARY
5,102,An awareness of the reporting framework underlying financial reports can assist in security  valuation and other financial analysis  The framework describes the objectives of financial  reporting desirable characteristics for financial reports the elements of financial reports and  the underlying assumptions and constraints of financial reporting  An understanding of the  framework which is broader than knowledge of a particular set of rules offers an analyst a  basis from which to infer the proper financial reporting and thus security valuation  implications of any financial statement element or transaction  The reading discusses the  conceptual objectives of financial reporting standards the parties involved in standard setting  processes and how financial reporting standards are converging into one global set of  standards 
6,102,Some key points of the reading are summarized below 
7,102,  The Objective of Financial Reporting 
8,102,  The objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial  information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential  investors lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing  resources to the entity  Those decisions involve buying selling or holding equity  and debt instruments and providing or settling loans and other forms of credit   
9,102,  Financial reporting requires policy choices and estimates  These choices and  estimates require judgment which can vary from one preparer to the next   Accordingly standards are needed to ensure increased consistency in these  judgments 
10,102,  Financial Reporting Standard Setting Bodies and Regulatory Authorities  Private sector  standard setting bodies and regulatory authorities play significant but different roles in the  standard setting process  In general standard setting bodies make the rules and  regulatory authorities enforce the rules  However regulators typically retain legal  authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction

2,103,  Convergence of Global Financial Reporting Standards  The IASB and FASB along with  other standard setters worked to achieve convergence of financial reporting standards   Many countries have adopted or permit the use of IFRS have indicated that they will  adopt IFRS in the future or have indicated that they are working on convergence with  IFRS  Listed companies in many countries are adopting IFRS  Barriers and challenges to  full convergence still exist 
3,103,  The IFRS Framework  The IFRS Framework sets forth the concepts that underlie the  preparation and presentation of financial statements for external users provides further  guidance on the elements from which financial statements are constructed and discusses  concepts of capital and capital maintenance 
4,103,  The objective of fair presentation of useful information is the center of the  Conceptual Framework         The qualitative characteristics of useful  information include fundamental and enhancing characteristics  Information must  exhibit the fundamental characteristics of relevance and faithful representation to  be useful  The enhancing characteristics identified are comparability verifiability  timeliness and understandability 
5,103,  The IFRS Framework identifies the following elements of financial statements   assets liabilities equity income expenses and capital maintenance adjustments 
6,103,  The Conceptual Framework        is constructed based on the underlying  assumptions of accrual basis and going concern and acknowledges the inherent  constraint of benefit versus cost 
7,103,  IFRS Financial Statements  IAS No    prescribes that a complete set of financial  statements includes a statement of financial position  balance sheet  a statement of  comprehensive income  either two statements one for net income and one for  comprehensive income or a single statement combining both net income and  comprehensive income  a statement of changes in equity a cash flow statement and  notes  The notes include a summary of significant accounting policies and other  explanatory information 
8,103,  Financial statements need to reflect certain basic features  fair presentation going  concern accrual basis materiality and aggregation no offsetting and consistency 
9,103,  Financial statements must be prepared at least annually and must include  comparative information from the previous period 
10,103,  Financial statements must follow certain presentation requirements including a  classified balance sheet minimum information on the face of the financial  statements and in the notes 
11,103,  Characteristics of a Coherent Financial Reporting Framework  Effective frameworks  share three characteristics  transparency comprehensiveness and consistency  Effective  standards can however differ on appropriate valuation bases the basis for standard  setting  principle or rules based  and resolution of conflicts between balance sheet and  income statement focus 
12,103,  Comparison of IFRS with Alternative Reporting Systems  A significant number of the  world s listed companies report under either IFRS or US GAAP

2,104,  In most cases a user of financial statements will lack the information necessary to  make specific adjustments required to achieve comparability between companies  that use IFRS and companies that use US GAAP  Instead an analyst must maintain  general caution in interpreting comparative financial measures produced under  different accounting standards and monitor significant developments in financial  reporting standards 
3,104,  Monitoring Developments  Analysts can remain aware of ongoing developments in  financial reporting by monitoring three areas  new products or types of transactions   actions of standard setters regulators and other groups  and company disclosures  regarding critical accounting policies and estimates

6,107,SOLUTIONS
7,107,   C is correct  Financial statements provide information including information about the  entity s financial position performance and changes in financial position to users  They  do not typically provide information about users 
8,107,   B is correct  The IASB is currently charged with developing International Financial  Reporting Standards 
9,107,   B is correct  The FASB is responsible for the Accounting Standards Codification  the  single source of nongovernmental authoritative US generally accepted accounting  principles 
10,107,   B is correct  Accounting standards boards should be guided by a well articulated  framework  They should be independent  and while they consider input from  stakeholders the process should not be compromised by pressure from external forces  including political pressure  Accounting standards boards should have adequate  resources 
11,107,   C is correct  A core objective of IOSCO is to ensure that markets are fair efficient and  transparent  The other core objectives are to reduce not eliminate systemic risk and to  protect investors not all users of financial statements 
12,107,   A is correct  Accuracy is not an enhancing qualitative characteristic  Faithful  representation not accuracy is a fundamental qualitative characteristic 
13,107,   A is correct  Understandability is an enhancing qualitative characteristic of financial  information not a constraint 
14,107,   C is correct  The Conceptual Framework        identifies two important underlying  assumptions of financial statements  accrual basis and going concern  Going concern is  the assumption that the entity will continue to operate for the foreseeable future   Enterprises with the intent to liquidate or materially curtail operations would require  different information for a fair presentation 
15,107,   B is correct  Accrual basis reflects the effects of transactions and other events being  recognized when they occur not when the cash flows  These effects are recorded and  reported in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate 
16,107,    C is correct  The fundamental qualitative characteristic of faithful representation is  contributed to by completeness neutrality and freedom from error

10,108,NOTES
11,108, The body of standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  IASB  is referred to as  International Financial Reporting Standards 
12,108, In September      the IASB adopted the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting in place of the  Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements         The Conceptual Framework represents the partial completion of a joint convergence project between the IASB and FASB on an updated  framework  The Conceptual Framework        contains two updated chapters  The objective of financial reporting and Qualitative characteristics of useful financial information  The remainder of the material in the Conceptual  Framework is from the Framework        and will be updated as the project is completed  Also in September       the FASB issued Concepts Statement   Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting to replace  Concepts Statements   and   
13,108, Conceptual Framework        Chapter   OB   Under US GAAP the identical statement appears in Concept  Statement   Chapter   OB  
14,108, The Framework        stated that  The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the  financial position performance and changes in financial position of an entity  this information should be useful to  a wide range of users for the purpose of making economic decisions  
15,108, The IFRS Foundation was previously named the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation   IASC Foundation  
16,108, Although the name of the IASB incorporates  Accounting Standards  and early standards were titled  International Accounting Standards  IAS  the term  International Financial Reporting Standards   IFRS  is being  used for new standards  The use of the words  financial reporting  recognizes the importance of disclosures  outside of the core financial statements such as management discussion of the business risks and future plans

7,113,   INTRODUCTION
8,113,The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company s business  activities over a period of time  The income statement communicates how much revenue the  company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating  that revenue  The basic equation underlying the income statement ignoring gains and losses is  Revenue minus Expenses equals Net income  The income statement is also sometimes referred  to as the  statement of operations   statement of earnings  or  profit and loss  P L   statement   Under International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  the income statement  may be presented as a separate statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income that  begins with the profit or loss from the income statement or as a section of a single statement of  comprehensive income   US generally accepted accounting principles  US GAAP  permit the  same alternative presentation formats   This reading focuses on the income statement but also  discusses comprehensive income  profit or loss from the income statement plus other  comprehensive income  
9,113,Investment analysts intensely scrutinize companies  income statements   Equity analysts are  interested in them because equity markets often reward relatively high  or low earnings growth  companies with above average or below average valuations respectively and because inputs  into valuation models often include estimates of earnings  Fixed income analysts examine the  components of income statements past and projected for information on companies  abilities to  make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle  Corporate  financial announcements frequently emphasize information reported in income statements  particularly earnings more than information reported in the other financial statements

3,114,   COMPONENTS AND FORMAT OF THE  INCOME STATEMENT
4,114,On the top line of the income statement companies typically report revenue  Revenue generally refers to amounts charged  and expected to be received  for the delivery of goods or  services in the ordinary activities of a business  The term net revenue means that the revenue  number is reported after adjustments  e g  for cash or volume discounts or for estimated  returns   Revenue may be called sales or turnover   Exhibits   and   show the income  statements for Groupe Danone a French food manufacturer and Kraft Foods a US food  manufacturer   For the year ended    December      Danone reports        billion of net  revenue whereas Kraft reports        billion of net revenue

2,116,Note that Danone lists the years in increasing order from left to right with the most recent year  in the right most column whereas Kraft lists the years in decreasing order with the most recent  year listed in the left most column  Different orderings of chronological information are  common  Differences in presentations of items such as expenses are also common  Expenses reflect outflows depletions of assets and incurrences of liabilities in the course of the activities  of a business  Expenses may be grouped and reported in different formats subject to some  specific requirements  For example Danone reports research and development expenses as a  separate line item whereas Kraft combines research costs with marketing and administration  costs and reports the total in a single line item 
3,116,Another difference is how the companies indicate that an amount on the income statement  results in a reduction in net income  Danone shows expenses such as cost of goods sold and  selling expenses in parentheses to explicitly indicate that these are subtracted from revenue and  reduce net income  Kraft on the other hand does not place cost of sales in parentheses  Rather  Kraft assumes that the user implicitly understands that this is an expense and is subtracted in  arriving at gross profit subtotals such as operating earnings and ultimately in net income  In  general companies may or may not enclose an amount in parentheses  or use a negative sign  to  indicate that it is a reduction in net income  Furthermore within a list of items that normally  reduce net income an item that increases net income may be shown as a negative  In this case  the item is actually added rather than subtracted in calculating net income  In summary because  there is flexibility in how companies may present the income statement the analyst should  always verify the order of years how expenses are grouped and reported and how to treat items  presented as negatives 
4,116,At the bottom of the income statement companies report net income  companies may use other  terms such as  net earnings  or  profit or loss    For      Danone reports       million of net  income and Kraft reports       million of net earnings  Net income is often referred to as the   bottom line   The basis for this expression is that net income is the final or bottom line  item in an income statement  Because net income is often viewed as the single most relevant  number to describe a company s performance over a period of time the term  bottom line   sometimes is used in business to refer to any final or most relevant result 
5,116,Despite this customary terminology note that the companies both present another item below  net income  information about how much of that net income is attributable to the company itself  and how much of that income is attributable to minority interests or non controlling interests   Danone and Kraft both consolidate subsidiaries over which they have control  Consolidation  means that they include all of the revenues and expenses of the subsidiaries even if they own  less than     percent  Minority interest represents the portion of income that  belongs  to  minority shareholders of the consolidated subsidiaries as opposed to the parent company itself   For Danone       million of the net income amount is attributable to shareholders of Groupe  Danone and      million is attributable to minority interests  For Kraft       million of the  net earnings amount is attributable to the shareholders of Kraft Foods and    million is  attributable to the non controlling interest

2,117,Net income also includes gains and losses which are increases and decreases in economic  benefits respectively which may or may not arise in the ordinary activities of the business  For  example when a manufacturing company sells its products these transactions are reported as  revenue and the costs incurred to generate these revenues are expenses and are presented  separately  However if a manufacturing company sells surplus land that is not needed the  transaction is reported as a gain or a loss  The amount of the gain or loss is the difference  between the carrying value of the land and the price at which the land is sold  For example in  Exhibit   Kraft reports a loss  proceeds net of carrying value  of    million on divestitures in  fiscal       Kraft discloses in the notes to consolidated financial statements that the assets sold  included a nutritional energy bar operation in the United States a juice operation in Brazil and  a plant in Spain 
3,117,The definition of income encompasses both revenue and gains and the definition of expenses  encompasses both expenses that arise in the ordinary activities of the business and losses   Thus net income  profit or loss  can be defined as  a  income minus expenses or equivalently  b  revenue plus other income plus gains minus expenses or equivalently c  revenue plus other  income plus gains minus expenses in the ordinary activities of the business minus other  expenses and minus losses  The last definition can be rearranged as follows  net income equals   i  revenue minus expenses in the ordinary activities of the business plus  ii  other income  minus other expenses plus  iii  gains minus losses 
4,117,In addition to presenting the net income income statements also present items including  subtotals which are significant to users of financial statements  Some of the items are specified  by IFRS but other items are not specified   Certain items such as revenue finance costs and  tax expense are required to be presented separately on the face of the income statement  IFRS  additionally require that line items headings and subtotals relevant to understanding the  entity s financial performance should be presented even if not specified  Expenses may be  grouped together either by their nature or function  Grouping together expenses such as  depreciation on manufacturing equipment and depreciation on administrative facilities into a  single line item called  depreciation  is an example of a grouping by nature of the expense   An example of grouping by function would be grouping together expenses into a category  such as cost of goods sold which may include labour and material costs depreciation some  salaries  e g  salespeople s  and other direct sales related expenses   Both Danone and Kraft  present their expenses by function which is sometimes referred to  cost of sales  method 
5,117,One subtotal often shown in an income statement is gross profit or gross margin  that is  revenue less cost of sales   When an income statement shows a gross profit subtotal it is said to  use a multi step format rather than a single step format  The Kraft Foods income statement  is an example of the multi step format whereas the Groupe Danone income statement is in a  single step format  For manufacturing and merchandising companies gross profit is a relevant  item and is calculated as revenue minus the cost of the goods that were sold  For service  companies gross profit is calculated as revenue minus the cost of services that were provided   In summary gross profit is the amount of revenue available after subtracting the costs of  delivering goods or services  Other expenses related to running the business are subtracted after  gross profit

2,118,Another important subtotal which may be shown on the income statement is operating profit  or synonymously operating income   Operating profit results from deducting operating  expenses such as selling general administrative and research and development expenses from  gross profit  Operating profit reflects a company s profits on its usual business activities before  deducting taxes and for non financial companies before deducting interest expense  For  financial companies interest expense would be included in operating expenses and subtracted  in arriving at operating profit because it relates to the operating activities for such companies   For some companies composed of a number of separate business segments operating profit can  be useful in evaluating the performance of the individual business segments because interest  and tax expenses may be more relevant at the level of the overall company rather than an  individual segment level  The specific calculations of gross profit and operating profit may vary  by company and a reader of financial statements can consult the notes to the statements to  identify significant variations across companies 
3,118,Operating profit is sometimes referred to as EBIT  earnings before interest and taxes    However operating profit and EBIT are not necessarily the same  Note that in both Exhibits   and   interest and taxes do not represent the only differences between earnings  net income net  earnings  and operating income  For example both companies separately report some income  from discontinued operations 
4,118,Exhibit   shows an excerpt from the income statement of CRA International a company  providing management consulting services  Accordingly CRA deducts cost of services  rather  than cost of goods  from revenues to derive gross profit  CRA s fiscal year ends on the last  Saturday in November and periodically  for example in       its fiscal year will contain     weeks rather than    weeks  Although the extra week is likely immaterial in computing year to  year growth rates it may have a material impact on a quarter containing the extra week  In  general an analyst should be alert to the effect of an extra week when making historical  comparisons and forecasting future performance

2,119,Exhibits     and   illustrate basic points about the income statement including variations  across the statements some of which depend on the industry and or country and some of  which reflect differences in accounting policies and practices of a particular company  In  addition some differences within an industry are primarily differences in terminology whereas  others are more fundamental accounting differences  Notes to the financial statements are  helpful in identifying such differences 
3,119,Having introduced the components and format of an income statement the next objective is to  understand the actual reported numbers in it  To accurately interpret reported numbers the  analyst needs to be familiar with the principles of revenue and expense recognition that is  how revenue and expenses are measured and attributed to a given accounting reporting period 
4,119,   REVENUE RECOGNITION
5,119,Revenue is the top line in an income statement so we begin the discussion of line items in the  income statement with revenue recognition  We will first discuss revenue recognition under  IFRS and US GAAP prior to the application of converged standards issued May       In May       the IASB and FASB issued IFRS    and ASC Topic     respectively for revenue  recognition  The nearly identical standards resulted from an effort to achieve convergence  consistency and transparency in revenue recognition globally  Key aspects and some  implications of the standards are discussed at the end of this section 
6,119,A first task is to explain some relevant accounting terminology  The terms revenue sales gains  losses and net income  profit net earnings  have been briefly defined  The IASB Conceptual  Framework for Financial Reporting         referred to hereafter as the Conceptual  Framework further defines and discusses these income statement items  The Framework explains that profit is a frequently used measure of performance and is composed of income and  expenses    It defines income as follows 
7,119,Income is increases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form  of inflows or enhancements of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in  increases in equity other than those relating to contributions from equity  participants   
8,119,In IFRS the term  income  includes revenue and gains  Gains are similar to revenue but they  typically arise from secondary or peripheral activities rather than from a company s primary  business activities  For example for a restaurant the sale of surplus restaurant equipment for  more than its carrying value is referred to as a gain rather than as revenue  Similarly a loss  typically arises from secondary activities  Gains and losses may be considered part of operating  activities  e g  a loss due to a decline in the value of inventory  or may be considered part of  non operating activities  e g  the sale of non trading investments  
9,119,In the following simple hypothetical scenario revenue recognition is straightforward  a  company sells goods to a buyer for cash and does not allow returns so the company recognizes  revenue when the exchange of goods for cash takes place and measures revenue at the amount  of cash received  In practice however determining when revenue should be recognized and at  what amount is considerably more complex for reasons discussed in the following sections

2,120,     General Principles
3,120,An important aspect concerning revenue recognition is that it can occur independently of cash  movements  For example assume a company sells goods to a buyer on credit so does not  actually receive cash until some later time  A fundamental principle of accrual accounting is  that revenue is recognized  reported on the income statement  when it is earned so the  company s financial records reflect revenue from the sale when the risk and reward of  ownership is transferred  this is often when the company delivers the goods or services  If the  delivery was on credit a related asset such as trade or accounts receivable is created  Later  when cash changes hands the company s financial records simply reflect that cash has been  received to settle an account receivable  Similarly there are situations when a company receives  cash in advance and actually delivers the product or service later perhaps over a period of time   In this case the company would record a liability for unearned revenue when the cash is  initially received and revenue would be recognized as being earned over time as products and  services are delivered  An example would be a subscription payment received for a publication  that is to be delivered periodically over time 
4,120,When to recognize revenue  report it on the income statement  is a critical issue in accounting   Up until   January      the original international accounting standard  IAS     which has  been replaced by IFRS    specified that revenue from the sale of goods should be recognized  when the following conditions are satisfied   
5,120,  the entity has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of  the goods 
6,120,  the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually  associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold 
7,120,  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably 
8,120,  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the  entity  and
9,120,  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably 
10,120,In simple words this basically says revenue is recognized when the seller no longer bears risks  with respect to the goods  for example if the goods were destroyed by fire it would be a loss to  the purchaser  the seller cannot tell the purchaser what to do with the goods the seller knows  what it expects to collect and is reasonably certain of collection and the seller knows how much  the goods cost 
11,120,The transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership normally occurs when goods are delivered to  the buyer or when legal title to goods transfers  However as noted by the above remaining  conditions physical transfer of goods will not always result in the recognition of revenue  For  example if goods are delivered to a retail store to be sold on consignment and title is not  transferred the revenue would not yet be recognized   
12,120,IAS    specifed similar criteria for recognizing revenue for the rendering of services    When  the outcome could be estimated reliably revenue associated with the transaction was  recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date   The conditions for determining whether a transaction could be estimated reliably were as  follows

2,121,  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably 
3,121,  it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the  entity 
4,121,  the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured  reliably  and
5,121,  the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be  measured reliably 
6,121,Similar criteria have been applied to recognizing interest royalties and dividends  it is probable  that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the amount  of the revenue can be reliably measured 
7,121,US GAAP   specify that revenue should be recognized when it is  realized or realizable and  earned   The US Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC    motivated in part because of  the frequency with which overstating revenue occurs in connection with fraud and or  misstatements provides guidance on how to apply the accounting principles  This guidance lists  four criteria to determine when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
8,121,   There is evidence of an arrangement between buyer and seller  For instance this would  disallow the practice of recognizing revenue in a period by delivering the product just  before the end of an accounting period and then completing a sales contract after the  period end 
9,121,   The product has been delivered or the service has been rendered  For instance this would  preclude revenue recognition when the product has been shipped but the risks and  rewards of ownership have not actually passed to the buyer 
10,121,   The price is determined or determinable  For instance this would preclude a company  from recognizing revenue that is based on some contingency 
11,121,   The seller is reasonably sure of collecting money  For instance this would preclude a  company from recognizing revenue when the customer is unlikely to pay 
12,121,Companies must disclose their revenue recognition policies in the notes to their financial  statements  sometimes referred to as footnotes   Analysts should review these policies carefully  to understand how and when a company recognizes revenue which may differ depending on  the types of product sold and services rendered  Exhibit   presents a portion of the summary of  significant accounting policies note that discusses revenue recognition for DaimlerChrysler  from its      annual report prepared under IFRS 
13,121,Exhibit    Excerpt from DaimlerChrysler Notes
14,121,Revenue from sales of vehicles service parts and other related products  is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are  transferred to the customer the amount of revenue can be estimated  reliably and collectability is reasonably assured  Revenue is recognized  net of discounts cash sales incentives customer bonuses and rebates  granted

6,122,Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue generated from the sale of  vehicles  Sales are recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership are  transferred to our customers  generally dealers and distributors   For the  majority of our sales this occurs when products are shipped from our  manufacturing facilities or delivered to our customers  When vehicles are  shipped to customers or vehicle modifiers on consignment revenue is  recognized when the vehicle is sold to the ultimate customer

8,122,Marketing Incentives and Interest Supplements
9,122,Marketing incentives generally are recognized by the Automotive sector  as revenue reductions in Automotive sales  These include customer and  dealer cash payments and costs for special financing and leasing  programs paid to the Financial Services sector  The revenue reductions  are accrued at the later of the date the related vehicle sales to the dealers  are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and  communicated  We generally estimate these accruals using marketing  programs that are approved as of the balance sheet date and are expected  to be effective at the beginning of the subsequent period  The Financial  Services sector identifies payments for special financing and leasing  programs as interest supplements or other support costs and recognizes  them consistent with the earnings process of the underlying receivable or  operating lease

2,123,The topic of revenue recognition remains important and new challenges have evolved  particularly in areas of e commerce and services such as software development  Standard setters  continue to evaluate current revenue recognition standards and issue new guidance periodically  to deal with new types of transactions  Additionally there are occasional special cases for  revenue recognition as discussed in the next section 
3,123,     Revenue Recognition in Special Cases
4,123,The general principles discussed above are helpful for dealing with most revenue recognition  issues  There are some instances where revenue recognition is more difficult to determine  For  example in limited circumstances revenue may be recognized before or after goods are  delivered or services are rendered as summarized in Exhibit   
5,123,Exhibit    Revenue Recognition in Special Cases
6,123,Before Goods Are Fully  Delivered or Services  Completely Rendered For example with long  term contracts where the  outcome can be reliably  measured the percentage  of completion method is  used 
7,123,At the Time  Goods Are  Delivered or  Services  Rendered Recognize  revenues using  normal revenue  recognition  criteria 
8,123,After Goods Are Delivered or  Services Rendered For example with real estate  sales where there is doubt about  the buyer s ability to complete  payments the installment  method and cost recovery  method are appropriate 
9,123,The following sections discuss revenue recognition in the case of long term contracts  installment sales and barter

2,124,       Long Term Contracts
3,124,A long term contract is one that spans a number of accounting periods  Such contracts raise  issues in determining when the transaction has been completed and revenue recognition should  occur  How should a company apportion the revenue earned under a long term contract to each  accounting period  If for example the contract is a service contract or a licensing arrangement  the company may recognize the revenue on a prorated basis over the period of the contract  rather than at the end of the contract term  Under the original IAS standards  IAS    and IAS      this was done using the percentage of completion method    Under this method revenue is  recognized based on the stage of completion of a transaction or contract and is thus recognized  when the services are rendered  Construction contracts are notable examples of such  contracts    When the outcome of a construction contract could be measured reliably revenue  and expenses were recognized in reference to the stage of completion  US GAAP have similar  requirements for long term contracts including construction contracts 
4,124,Under the percentage of completion method in each accounting period the company  estimates what percentage of the contract is complete and then reports that percentage of the  total contract revenue in its income statement  Contract costs for the period are expensed  against the revenue  Therefore net income or profit is reported each year as work is performed 
5,124,Under IFRS if the outcome of the contract cannot be measured reliably then revenue may be  recognized to the extent of contract costs incurred  but only if it is probable the costs will be  recovered   Costs are expensed in the period incurred  Under this method no profit is  recognized until all the costs had been recovered  Under US GAAP but not under IFRS a  revenue recognition method used when the outcome cannot be measured reliably is the  completed contract method  Under the completed contract method the company does not  report any income until the contract is substantially finished  the remaining costs and potential  risks are insignificant in amount  although provision should be made for expected losses   Billings and costs are accumulated on the balance sheet rather than flowing through the income  statement  Under US GAAP the completed contract method is also acceptable when the entity  has primarily short term contracts  Note that if a contract is started and completed in the same  period there is no difference between the percentage of completion and completed contract  methods 
6,124,Examples     and   provide illustrations of these revenue recognition methods  As shown the  percentage of completion method results in revenue recognition sooner than the completed  contract method and thus may be considered a less conservative approach  In addition the  percentage of completion method relies on management estimates and is thus not as objective  as the completed contract method  However an advantage of the percentage of completion  method is that it results in better matching of revenue recognition with the accounting period in  which it was earned  Because of better matching with the periods in which work is performed  the percentage of completion method is the preferred method of revenue recognition for long  term contracts and is required when the outcome can be measured reliably under both IFRS and  US GAAP  Under both IFRS and US GAAP if a loss is expected on the contract the loss is  reported immediately not upon completion of the contract regardless of the method used  e g   percentage of completion or completed contract

2,127,Solution 
3,127,Under IFRS revenue may be recognized to the extent of contract costs incurred if the  outcome of the contract cannot be measured reliably and it is probable that costs will be  recovered  In this example the outcome is uncertain but it is probable that Kolenda will  recover the costs up to     million  Under US GAAP the company would use the  completed contract method  No revenue will be recognized until the contract is  complete 
4,127,Year    Under IFRS Kolenda would recognize    million cost of construction     million revenue and thus    income  Under US GAAP Kolenda would recognize     cost of construction    revenue and thus    income  The    million expenditure would  be reported as an increase in the inventory account  construction in progress  and a  decrease in cash 
5,127,Year    Under IFRS Kolenda would recognize      million cost of construction       million revenue and thus    income  Under US GAAP Kolenda would recognize     cost of construction    revenue and thus    income  The      million expenditures  would be reported as an increase in the inventory account  construction in progress  and  a decrease in cash 
6,127,Year    Under IFRS Kolenda would recognize the      million cost of construction  incurred in the period  Because the contract has been completed and the outcome is now  measurable the company would recognize the remaining      million revenue on the  contract and thus    million income  Under US GAAP because the contract has been  completed Kolenda would recognize the total contract revenue  i e      million    Kolenda would recognize    million cost of construction and thus    million income   The inventory account  construction in progress  would be eliminated

2,128,       Installment Sales
3,128,As noted above revenue is normally reported when goods are delivered or services are  rendered independent of the period in which cash payments for those goods or services are  received  This principle applies even to installment sales sales in which proceeds are to be  paid in installments over an extended period  For installment sales IFRS separate the  installments into the sale price which is the discounted present value of the installment  payments and an interest component  Revenue attributable to the sale price is recognized at the  date of sale and revenue attributable to the interest component is recognized over time    International standards note however that the guidance for revenue recognition must be  considered in light of local laws regarding the sale of goods in a particular country  Under  limited circumstances recognition of revenue or profit may be required to be deferred for some  installment sales  An example of such deferral arises for certain sales of real estate on an  installment basis  Revenue recognition for sales of real estate varies depending on specific  aspects of the sale transaction   
4,128,Under US GAAP when the seller has completed the significant activities in the earnings  process and is either assured of collecting the selling price or able to estimate amounts that will  not be collected a sale of real estate is reported at the time of sale using the normal revenue  recognition conditions    When those two conditions are not fully met under US GAAP some  of the profit is deferred  Two of the methods may be appropriate in these limited circumstances  and relate to the amount of profit to be recognized each year from the transaction  the  installment method and the cost recovery method  Under the installment method the  portion of the total profit of the sale that is recognized in each period is determined by the  percentage of the total sales price for which the seller has received cash  Under the cost  recovery method the seller does not report any profit until the cash amounts paid by the  buyer including principal and interest on any financing from the seller are greater than all  the seller s costs of the property  Note that the cost recovery method is similar to the revenue  recognition method under international standards described above when the outcome of a  contract cannot be measured reliably  although the term cost recovery method is not used in the  international standard  
5,128,Example   illustrates the differences between the installment method and the cost recovery  method  Installment sales and cost recovery treatment of revenue recognition are rare for  financial reporting purposes especially for assets other than real estate 
6,128,EXAMPLE  
7,128,The Installment and Cost Recovery Methods  of Revenue Recognition
8,128,Assume the total sales price and cost of a property are          and           respectively so that the total profit to be recognized is          The amount of cash  received by the seller as a down payment is         with the remainder of the sales  price to be received over a    year period  It has been determined that there is  significant doubt about the ability and commitment of the buyer to complete all  payments  How much profit will be recognized attributable to the down payment if

2,129,   The installment method is used 
3,129,   The cost recovery method is used 
4,129,Solution to   
5,129,The installment method apportions the cash receipt between cost recovered and profit  using the ratio of profit to sales value  here this ratio equals                          or    percent  Therefore the seller will recognize the following profit attributable  to the down payment     percent of                   
6,129,Solution to   
7,129,Under the cost recovery method of revenue recognition the company would not  recognize any profit attributable to the down payment because the cash amounts paid by  the buyer still do not exceed the cost of          
8,129,       Barter
9,129,Revenue recognition issues related to barter transactions  non monetary exchanges  became  particularly important as e commerce developed  As an example if Company A exchanges  advertising space for computer equipment from Company B but no cash changes hands can  Company A and B both report revenue  Such an exchange is referred to as a  barter  transaction  
10,129,An even more challenging revenue recognition issue evolved from a specific type of barter  transaction a round trip transaction  As an example if Company A sells advertising services  or  energy contracts or commodities  to Company B and almost simultaneously buys an almost  identical product from Company B can Company A report revenue at the fair value of the  product sold  Because the company s revenue would be approximately equal to its expense the  net effect of the transaction would have no impact on net income or cash flow  However the  amount of revenue reported would be higher and the amount of revenue can be important to a  company s valuation  In the earlier stages of e commerce for example some equity valuations  were based on sales  because many early internet companies reported no net income  
11,129,Under IFRS revenue from barter transactions must be measured based on the fair value of  revenue from similar non barter transactions with unrelated parties  parties other than the barter  partner     US GAAP state that revenue can be recognized at fair value only if a company has  historically received cash payments for such services and can thus use this historical experience  as a basis for determining fair value  otherwise the revenue from the barter transaction is  recorded at the carrying amount of the asset surrendered

2,130,       Gross versus Net Reporting
3,130,Another revenue recognition issue that became particularly important with the emergence of  e commerce is the issue of gross versus net reporting  Merchandising companies typically sell  products that they purchased from a supplier  In accounting for their sales the company records  the amount of the sale proceeds as sales revenue and their cost of the products as the cost of  goods sold  As internet based merchandising companies developed many sold products that  they had never held in inventory  they simply arranged for the supplier to ship the products  directly to the end customer  In effect many such companies were agents of the supplier  company and the net difference between their sales proceeds and their costs was equivalent to a  sales commission  What amount should these companies record as their revenues the gross  amount of sales proceeds received from their customers or the net difference between sales  proceeds and their cost 
4,130,US GAAP indicate that the approach should be based on the specific situation and provides  guidance for determining when revenue should be reported gross versus net    To report gross  revenues the following criteria are relevant  the company is the primary obligor under the  contract bears inventory risk and credit risk can choose its supplier and has reasonable latitude  to establish price  If these criteria are not met the company should report revenues net   Example   provides an illustration 
5,130,EXAMPLE  
6,130,Gross versus Net Reporting of Revenues
7,130,Flyalot has agreements with several major airlines to obtain airline tickets at reduced  rates  The company pays only for tickets it sells to customers  In the most recent period  Flyalot sold airline tickets to customers over the internet for a total of      million  The  cost of these tickets to Flyalot was    million  The company s direct selling costs were         Once the customers receive their ticket the airline is responsible for providing  all services associated with the customers  flights

4,131,     Implications for Financial Analysis
5,131,As we have seen companies use a variety of revenue recognition methods  Furthermore a  single company may use different revenue recognition policies for different businesses   Companies disclose their revenue recognition policies in the notes to their financial statement  often in the first note 
6,131,The following aspects of a company s revenue recognition policy are particularly relevant to  financial analysis  whether a policy results in recognition of revenue sooner rather than later   sooner is less conservative  and to what extent a policy requires the company to make  estimates  In order to analyze a company s financial statements and particularly to compare one  company s financial statements with those of another company it is helpful to understand any  differences in their revenue recognition policies  Although it may not be possible to calculate  the monetary effect of differences between particular companies  revenue recognition policies  and estimates it is generally possible to characterize the relative conservatism of a company s  policies and to qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios 
7,131,EXAMPLE  
8,131,Revenue Recognition Policy for Apple
9,131,As disclosed in the excerpt from notes to the consolidated financial statements shown  below  emphasis added  Apple Inc  uses different revenue recognition policies  depending on the type of revenue producing activity including product sales service  and support contracts and products obtained from other companies  Note that these are  only the first three paragraphs of Apple s disclosure on revenue recognition  the entire  revenue recognition portion has nine paragraphs 
10,131,Revenue Recognition
11,131,Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware software  digital content and applications peripherals and service and support  contracts  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of  an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or  determinable and collection is probable  Product is considered delivered to  the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have  been transferred  For most of the Company s product sales these criteria  are met at the time the product is shipped  For online sales to individuals  for some sales to education customers in the United States and for certain  other sales the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the  product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on  these sales during transit  portions omitted

3,132,The Company sells software and peripheral products obtained from other  companies  The Company generally establishes its own pricing and retains  related inventory risk is the primary obligor in sales transactions with its  customers and assumes the credit risk for amounts billed to its customers   Accordingly the Company generally recognizes revenue for the sale of  products obtained from other companies based on the gross amount billed

5,132,   What criteria does Apple apply to determine when to recognize revenue from  product sales 
6,132,   What principle underpins the company s deferral of revenue from service and  support contracts 
7,132,Solution to   
8,132,Apple recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery  has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable  Note  that these are just the four US GAAP revenue recognition criteria described in Section       Note also that Apple recognizes revenue on some product sales at the time of  shipment and others at the time of delivery depending on when its risk of loss ends 
9,132,Solution to   
10,132,The basic principle underpinning the company s deferral of revenue for service and  sales contracts is that revenue should be recognized in the period it is earned  Because  service under these contracts will be performed in future periods the company defers  the revenue and then recognizes it over the time it is earned

12,132,It is clear from the preceding sections that revenue recognition varies globally which makes  comparisons of revenue challenging  The converged accounting standards issued by the IASB  and FASB in May      introduce some changes to the basic principles of revenue recognition  and should enhance comparability    The standards became effective for reporting periods  beginning after   January      under IFRS  IFRS     and    December      under US GAAP   The following section describes key aspects of the standards  the core principle the five steps in  recognizing revenue treatment of some related costs and disclosure requirements

2,133,The content of the two standards is nearly identical and this discussion pertains to both unless  specified otherwise  Issuance of this converged standard is significant because of the differences  between IFRS and US GAAP on revenue recognition prior to the converged standard  The  converged standard aims to provide a principles based approach to revenue recognition that can  be applied to many types of revenue generating activities 
3,133,The core principle of the converged standard is that revenue should be recognized to  depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration  to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services   To  achieve the core principle the standard describes the application of five steps in recognizing  revenue 
4,133,   Identify the contract s  with a customer
5,133,   Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract
6,133,   Determine the transaction price
7,133,   Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
8,133,   Recognize revenue when  or as  the entity satisfies a performance obligation
9,133,According to the standard a contract is an agreement and commitment with commercial  substance between the contacting parties  It establishes each party s obligations and rights  including payment terms  In addition a contract exists only if collectability is probable  Each  standard uses the same wording but the threshold for probable collectability differs  Under  IFRS probable means more likely than not and under US GAAP it means likely to occur  As a  result economically similar contracts may be treated differently under IFRs and US GAAP 
10,133,The performance obligations within a contract represent promises to transfer distinct good s  or  service s   A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or in  combination with readily available resources and if the promise to transfer it can be separated  from other promises in the contract  Each identified performance obligation is accounted for  separately 
11,133,The transaction price is what the seller estimates will be received in exchange for transferring  the good s  or service s  identified in the contract  The transaction price is then allocated to  each identified performance obligation  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation  is fulfilled  Steps three and four address amount and step five addresses timing of recognition   The amount recognized reflects expectations about collectability and  if applicable  an  allocation to multiple obligations within the same contract  Revenue is recognized when the  obligation satisfying transfer is made 
12,133,Revenue should only be recognized when it is highly probable that it will not be subsequently  reversed  This may result in the recording of a minimal amount of revenue upon sale when an  estimate of total revenue is not reliable  The balance sheet will be required to reflect the entire  refund obligation as a liability and will include an asset for the  right to returned goods  based  on the carrying amount of inventory less costs of recovery 
13,133,When revenue is recognized a contract asset is presented on the balance sheet  It is only at the  point when all performance obligations have been met except for payment that a receivable  appears on the seller s balance sheet  If consideration is received in advance of transferring  good s  or service s  the seller presents a contract liability

2,134,The entity will recognize revenue when it is able to satisfy the performance obligation by  transferring control to the customer  Factors to consider when assessing whether the customer  has obtained control of an asset at a point in time 
3,134,  Entity has a present right to payment
4,134,  Customer has legal title
5,134,  Customer has physical possession
6,134,  Customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and
7,134,  Custer has accepted the asset 
8,134,For a simple contract with only one deliverable at a single point in time completing the five  steps is straight forward  For more complex contracts such as when the performance  obligations are satisfied over time when the terms of the multi period contracts change when  the performance obligation includes various components of goods and services or when the  compensation is  variable  accounting choices can be less obvious  The steps in the standards  are intended to provide guidance that can be generalized to most situations 
9,134,In addition the standard provides many specific examples  These examples are intended to  provide guidance as to how to approach more complex contracts  Some of these examples are  summarized in Exhibit    Note that the end result for many examples may not differ  substantially from that under revenue recognition standards that were in effect prior to the  adoption of the converged standard  instead it is the conceptual approach and in some cases  the terminology that will differ

13,134,Builder Co  enters into a contract with Customer Co  to construct a commercial  building  Builder Co  identifies various goods and services to be provided such as  pre construction engineering construction of the building s individual components  plumbing electrical wiring and interior finishes  With respect to  Identifying the  Performance Obligation  should Builder Co  treat each specific item as a separate  performance obligation to which revenue should be allocated

2,135,The standard provides two criteria which must be met to determine if a good or  service is distinct for purposes of identifying performance obligations  First the  customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other  readily available resources  Second the seller s  promise to transfer the good or  service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract    In this example the second criterion is not met because it is the building for which the  customer has contracted not the separate goods and services  The seller will integrate  all the goods and services into a combined output and each specific item should not  be treated as a distinct good or service but accounted for together as a single  performance obligation 
3,135,Part    ref  Example    
4,135,Builder Co  s contract with Customer Co  to construct the commercial building  specifies consideration of    million  Builder Co  s expected total costs are           The Builder incurs         in costs in the first year  Assuming that costs incurred  provide an appropriate measure of progress toward completing the contract how  much revenue should Builder Co  recognize for the first year 
5,135,The standard states that for performance obligations satisfied over time revenue is  recognized over time by measuring progress toward satisfying the obligation  In this  case the Builder has incurred     of the total expected costs                    and will thus recognize                   million  in revenue for the first year 
6,135,This is the same amount of revenue that would be recognized using  percentage of  completion  but that term is not used in the converged standard  Instead the  requirement is to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance  obligation 
7,135,Part    ref  Example    
8,135,Assume that Builder Co  s contract with Customer Co  to construct the commercial  building specifies consideration of    million plus a bonus of         if the building  is completed within   years  Builder Co  has only limited experience with similar  types of contracts and knows that many factors outside its control  e g  weather  regulatory requirements  could cause delay  Builder Co  s expected total costs are           The Builder incurs         in costs in the first year  Assuming that costs  incurred provide an appropriate measure of progress toward completing the contract  how much revenue should Builder Co  recognize for the first year 
9,135,The standard addresses so called  variable consideration  as part of determining the  transaction price  A company is only allowed to recognize variable consideration if it  can conclude that it will not have to reverse the cumulative revenue in the future  In  this case Builder Co  does not recognize any of the bonus in year one because it  cannot reach the non reversible conclusion given its limited experience with similar  contracts and potential delays from factors outside its control

2,136,Part    ref  Example    
3,136,Assume all facts from Part    In the beginning of year two Builder Co  and Customer  Co  agree to change the building floor plan and modify the contract  As a result the  consideration will increase by         and the allowable time for achieving the  bonus is extended by   months  Builder expects its costs will increase by           Also given the additional   months to earn the completion bonus Builder concludes  that it now meets the criteria for including the         bonus in revenue  How  should Builder account for this change in the contract 
4,136,Note that previous standards did not provide a general framework for contract  modifications  The converged standard provides guidance on whether a change in a  contract is a new contract or a modification of an existing contract  To be considered  a new contract the change would need to involve goods and services that are distinct  from the goods and services already transferred 
5,136,In this case the change does not meet the criteria of a new contract and is therefore  considered a modification of the existing contract which requires the company to  reflect the impact on a cumulative catch up basis  Therefore the company must  update its transaction price and measure of progress  Builder s total revenue on the  transaction  transaction price  is now       million     million original plus the          new consideration plus         for the completion bonus   Builder Co  s  progress toward completion is now                costs incurred divided by total  expected costs of           Based on the changes in the contract the amount of  additional revenue to be recognized is        calculated as                million   minus the         already recognized  The additional        of revenue would be  recognized as a  cumulative catch up adjustment  on the date of the contract  modification 
6,136,Some related costs require specific accounting treatment under the new standards  In particular  incremental costs of obtaining a contract and certain costs incurred to fulfill a contract must be  capitalized under the new standards  i e  reported as an asset on the balance sheet rather than as  an expense on the income statement   If a company had previously expensed these incremental  costs in the years prior to adopting the converged standard all else equal its profitability will  initially appear higher under the converged standards 
7,136,The disclosure requirements are quite extensive  Companies are required at year end   to  disclose information about contracts with customers disaggregated into different categories of  contracts  The categories might be based on the type of product the geographic region the type  of customer or sales channel the type of contract pricing terms the contract duration or the  timing of transfers  Companies are also required to disclose balances of any contract related  assets and liabilities and significant changes in those balances remaining performance  obligations and transaction price allocated to those obligations and any significant judgments  and changes in judgments related to revenue recognition  Significant judgments are those used  in determining timing and amounts of revenue to be recognized

2,137,The converged standard is expected to affect some industries more than others  For example  industries where bundled sales are common such as the telecommunications and software  industries are expected to be significantly affected by the converged standard  For the periods  prior to mandated adoption analysts will give careful attention to early adopters under both  IFRS and US GAAP and to all companies  disclosures about the impact of the converged  standard 
3,137,   EXPENSE RECOGNITION
4,137,Expenses are deducted against revenue to arrive at a company s net profit or loss  Under the  IASB Conceptual Framework expenses are  decreases in economic benefits during the  accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities  that result in decreases in equity other than those relating to distributions to equity  participants    
5,137,The IASB Conceptual Framework also states 
6,137,The definition of expenses encompasses losses as well as those expenses that arise  in the course of the ordinary activities of the enterprise  Expenses that arise in the  course of the ordinary activities of the enterprise include for example cost of sales  wages and depreciation  They usually take the form of an outflow or depletion of  assets such as cash and cash equivalents inventory property plant and equipment 
7,137,Losses represent other items that meet the definition of expenses and may or may  not arise in the course of the ordinary activities of the enterprise  Losses represent  decreases in economic benefits and as such they are no different in nature from  other expenses  Hence they are not regarded as a separate element in this  Conceptual Framework 
8,137,Losses include for example those resulting from disasters such as fire and flood  as well as those arising on the disposal of non current assets   
9,137,Similar to the issues with revenue recognition in a simple hypothetical scenario expense  recognition would not be an issue  For instance assume a company purchased inventory for  cash and sold the entire inventory in the same period  When the company paid for the inventory  absent indications to the contrary it is clear that the inventory cost has been incurred and when  that inventory is sold it should be recognized as an expense  cost of goods sold  in the financial  records  Assume also that the company paid all operating and administrative expenses in cash  within each accounting period  In such a simple hypothetical scenario no issues of expense  recognition would arise  In practice however as with revenue recognition determining when  expenses should be recognized can be somewhat more complex

2,138,In general a company recognizes expenses in the period that it consumes  i e  uses up  the  economic benefits associated with the expenditure or loses some previously recognized  economic benefit   
3,138,A general principle of expense recognition is the matching principle  Strictly speaking IFRS  do not refer to a  matching principle  but rather to a  matching concept  or to a process  resulting in  matching of costs with revenues     The distinction is relevant in certain standard  setting deliberations  Under matching a company recognizes some expenses  e g  cost of goods  sold  when associated revenues are recognized and thus expenses and revenues are matched   Associated revenues and expenses are those that result directly and jointly from the same  transactions or events  Unlike the simple scenario in which a company purchases inventory and  sells all of the inventory within the same accounting period in practice it is more likely that  some of the current period s sales are made from inventory purchased in a previous period or  previous periods  It is also likely that some of the inventory purchased in the current period will  remain unsold at the end of the current period and so will be sold in a following period   Matching requires that a company recognizes cost of goods sold in the same period as revenues  from the sale of the goods 
4,138,Period costs expenditures that less directly match revenues are reflected in the period when a  company makes the expenditure or incurs the liability to pay  Administrative expenses are an  example of period costs  Other expenditures that also less directly match revenues relate more  directly to future expected benefits  in this case the expenditures are allocated systematically  with the passage of time  An example is depreciation expense

2,139,Solution 
3,139,The revenue for      would be               units       per unit   Initially the total  cost of the goods purchased would be recorded as inventory  an asset  in the amount of           During      the cost of the      units sold would be expensed  matched  against the revenue  while the cost of the      remaining unsold units would remain in  inventory as follows 
4,139,Cost of Goods Sold From the first quarter      units at     per unit   From the second quarter      units at     per unit   From the third quarter      units at     per unit   Total cost of goods sold Cost of Goods Remaining in Inventory From the third quarter     units at     per unit   From the fourth quarter      units at     per unit   Total remaining  or ending  inventory cost

6,139,                    
7,139,To confirm that total costs are accounted for                              The cost  of the goods sold would be expensed against the revenue of         as follows 
8,139,Revenue Cost of goods sold Gross profit
9,139,                      
10,139,An alternative way to think about this is that the company created an asset  inventory  of          as it made its purchases  At the end of the period the value of the company s  inventory on hand is         Therefore the amount of the Cost of goods sold expense  recognized for the period should be the difference          
11,139,The remaining inventory amount of        will be matched against revenue in a future  year when the inventory items are sold

2,140,Alternative Inventory Costing Methods
3,140,In Example   KDL was able to specifically identify which inventory items were sold  and which remained in inventory to be carried over to later periods  This is called the  specific identification method and inventory and cost of goods sold are based on  their physical flow  It is generally not feasible to specifically identify which items were  sold and which remain on hand so accounting standards permit the assignment of  inventory costs to costs of goods sold and to ending inventory using cost formulas  IFRS  terminology  or cost flow assumptions  US GAAP   The cost formula or cost flow  assumption determines which goods are assumed to be sold and which goods are  assumed to remain in inventory  Both IFRS and US GAAP permit the use of the first in  first out  FIFO  method and the weighted average cost method to assign costs 
4,140,Under the FIFO method the oldest goods purchased  or manufactured  are assumed to  be sold first and the newest goods purchased  or manufactured  are assumed to remain  in inventory  Cost of goods in beginning inventory and costs of the first items purchased   or manufactured  flow into cost of goods sold first as if the earliest items purchased  sold first  Ending inventory would therefore include the most recent purchases  It turns  out that those items specifically identified as sold in Example   were also the first items  purchased so in this example under FIFO the cost of goods sold would also be          calculated as above 
5,140,The weighted average cost method assigns the average cost of goods available for  sale to the units sold and remaining in inventory  The assignment is based on the  average cost per unit  total cost of goods available for sale total units available for sale   and the number of units sold and the number remaining in inventory 
6,140,For KDL the weighted average cost per unit would be
7,140,             units            per unit
8,140,Cost of goods sold using the weighted average cost method would be
9,140,     units at                   
10,140,Ending inventory using the weighted average cost method would be
11,140,     units at                  
12,140,Another method is permitted under US GAAP but is not permitted under IFRS  This is  the last in first out  LIFO  method  Under the LIFO method the newest goods  purchased  or manufactured  are assumed to be sold first and the oldest goods purchased   or manufactured  are assumed to remain in inventory  Costs of the latest items  purchased flow into cost of goods sold first as if the most recent items purchased were  sold first  Although this may seem contrary to common sense it is logical in certain  circumstances  For example lumber in a lumberyard may be stacked up with the oldest  lumber on the bottom  As lumber is sold it is sold from the top of the stack so the last  lumber purchased and put in inventory is the first lumber out  Theoretically a company  should choose a method linked to the physical inventory flows    Under the LIFO  method in the KDL example it would be assumed that the      units remaining in  ending inventory would have come from the first quarter s purchases

4,141,Total costs of         less        remaining in ending inventory          
5,141,Alternatively the cost of the last      units purchased is allocated to cost of goods sold  under LIFO

7,141,An alternative way to think about expense recognition is that the company created an  asset  inventory  of         as it made its purchases  At the end of the period the  value of the company s inventory is         Therefore the amount of the Cost of  goods sold expense recognized for the period should be the difference

2,142,     Issues in Expense Recognition
3,142,The following sections cover applications of the principles of expense recognition to certain  common situations 
4,142,       Doubtful Accounts
5,142,When a company sells its products or services on credit it is likely that some customers will  ultimately default on their obligations  i e  fail to pay   At the time of the sale it is not known  which customer will default   If it were known that a particular customer would ultimately  default presumably a company would not sell on credit to that customer   One possible  approach to recognizing credit losses on customer receivables would be for the company to wait  until such time as a customer defaulted and only then recognize the loss  direct write off  method   Such an approach would usually not be consistent with generally accepted  accounting principles 
6,142,Under the matching principle at the time revenue is recognized on a sale a company is required  to record an estimate of how much of the revenue will ultimately be uncollectible  Companies  make such estimates based on previous experience with uncollectible accounts  Such estimates  may be expressed as a proportion of the overall amount of sales the overall amount of  receivables or the amount of receivables overdue by a specific amount of time  The company  records its estimate of uncollectible amounts as an expense on the income statement not as a  direct reduction of revenues 
7,142,       Warranties
8,142,At times companies offer warranties on the products they sell  If the product proves deficient in  some respect that is covered under the terms of the warranty the company will incur an expense  to repair or replace the product  At the time of sale the company does not know the amount of  future expenses it will incur in connection with its warranties  One possible approach would be  for a company to wait until actual expenses are incurred under the warranty and to reflect the  expense at that time  However this would not result in a matching of the expense with the  associated revenue 
9,142,Under the matching principle a company is required to estimate the amount of future expenses  resulting from its warranties to recognize an estimated warranty expense in the period of the  sale and to update the expense as indicated by experience over the life of the warranty 
10,142,       Depreciation and Amortisation
11,142,Companies commonly incur costs to obtain long lived assets  Long lived assets are assets  expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time greater than one year   Examples are land  property  plant equipment and intangible assets  assets lacking physical  substance  such as trademarks  The costs of most long lived assets are allocated over the period  of time during which they provide economic benefits  The two main types of long lived assets  whose costs are not allocated over time are land and those intangible assets with indefinite  useful lives

2,143,Depreciation is the process of systematically allocating costs of long lived assets over the  period during which the assets are expected to provide economic benefits   Depreciation  is the  term commonly applied to this process for physical long lived assets such as plant and  equipment  land is not depreciated  and amortisation is the term commonly applied to this  process for intangible long lived assets with a finite useful life    Examples of intangible long  lived assets with a finite useful life include an acquired mailing list an acquired patent with a  set expiration date and an acquired copyright with a set legal life  The term  amortisation  is  also commonly applied to the systematic allocation of a premium or discount relative to the face  value of a fixed income security over the life of the security 
3,143,IFRS allow two alternative models for valuing property plant and equipment  the cost model  and the revaluation model    Under the cost model the depreciable amount of that asset  cost  less residual value  is allocated on a systematic basis over the remaining useful life of the asset   Under the cost model the asset is reported at its cost less any accumulated depreciation  Under  the revaluation model the asset is reported at its fair value  The revaluation model is not  permitted under US GAAP  Here we will focus only on the cost model  There are two other  differences between IFRS and US GAAP to note  IFRS require each component of an asset to  be depreciated separately and US GAAP do not require component depreciation  and IFRS  require an annual review of residual value and useful life and US GAAP do not explicitly  require such a review 
4,143,The method used to compute depreciation should reflect the pattern over which the economic  benefits of the asset are expected to be consumed  IFRS do not prescribe a particular method for  computing depreciation but note that several methods are commonly used such as the straight  line method diminishing balance method  accelerated depreciation  and the units of production  method  depreciation varies depending upon production or usage  
5,143,The straight line method allocates evenly the cost of long lived assets less estimated residual  value over the estimated useful life of an asset   The term  straight line  derives from the fact  that the annual depreciation expense if represented as a line graph over time would be a  straight line  In addition a plot of the cost of the asset minus the cumulative amount of annual  depreciation expense if represented as a line graph over time would be a straight line with a  negative downward slope   Calculating depreciation and amortisation requires two significant  estimates  the estimated useful life of an asset and the estimated residual value  also known as   salvage value   of an asset  Under IFRS the residual value is the amount that the company  expects to receive upon sale of the asset at the end of its useful life  Example   assumes that an  item of equipment is depreciated using the straight line method and illustrates how the annual  depreciation expense varies under different estimates of the useful life and estimated residual  value of an asset  As shown annual depreciation expense is sensitive to both the estimated  useful life and to the estimated residual value

11,144,Generally alternatives to the straight line method of depreciation are called accelerated  methods of depreciation because they accelerate  i e  speed up  the timing of depreciation   Accelerated depreciation methods allocate a greater proportion of the cost to the early years of  an asset s useful life  These methods are appropriate if the plant or equipment is expected to be  used up faster in the early years  e g  an automobile   A commonly used accelerated method is  the diminishing balance method  also known as the declining balance method   The  diminishing balance method is demonstrated in Example

2,145,An Illustration of Diminishing Balance  Depreciation
3,145,Assume the cost of computer equipment was        the estimated residual value is        and the estimated useful life is five years  Under the diminishing or declining  balance method the first step is to determine the straight line rate the rate at which the  asset would be depreciated under the straight line method  This rate is measured as      percent divided by the useful life or    percent for a five year useful life  Under the  straight line method     or    percent of the depreciable cost of the asset  here                           would be expensed each year for five years  The depreciation  expense would be       per year 
4,145,The next step is to determine an acceleration factor that approximates the pattern of the  asset s wear  Common acceleration factors are     percent and     percent  The latter is  known as double declining balance depreciation because it depreciates the asset at  double the straight line rate  Using the     percent acceleration factor the diminishing  balance rate would be    percent     percent         This rate is then applied to the  remaining undepreciated balance of the asset each period  known as the net book
5,145,value  
6,145,At the beginning of the first year the net book value is         Depreciation expense  for the first full year of use of the asset would be    percent of        or         Under this method the residual value if any is generally not used in the computation of  the depreciation each period  the    percent is applied to        rather than to         minus residual value   However the company will stop taking depreciation when the  salvage value is reached 
7,145,At the beginning of Year   the net book value is measured as
8,145,Asset cost Less  Accumulated depreciation Net book value
9,145,                   
10,145,For the second full year depreciation expense would be            percent or         At the end of the second year  i e  beginning of the third year  a total of                        of depreciation would have been recorded  So the remaining net book value  at the beginning of the third year would be

5,146,Asset cost Less  Accumulated depreciation Net book value
6,146,                   
7,146,For the fifth year if deprecation were determined as in previous years it would amount  to                  percent   However this would result in a remaining net book value  of the asset below its estimated residual value of        So instead only      would  be depreciated leaving a       net book value at the end of the fifth year 
8,146,Asset cost        Less  Accumulated depreciation         Net book value      
9,146,Companies often use a zero or small residual value which creates problems for  diminishing balance depreciation because the asset never fully depreciates  In order to  fully depreciate the asset over the initially estimated useful life when a zero or small  residual value is assumed companies often adopt a depreciation policy that combines  the diminishing balance and straight line methods  An example would be a deprecation  policy of using double declining balance depreciation and switching to the straight line  method halfway through the useful life 
10,146,Under accelerated depreciation methods there is a higher depreciation expense in early years  relative to the straight line method  This results in higher expenses and lower net income in the  early depreciation years  In later years there is a reversal with accelerated depreciation expense  lower than straight line depreciation  Accelerated depreciation is sometimes referred to as a  conservative accounting choice because it results in lower net income in the early years of asset  use 
11,146,For those intangible assets that must be amortised  those with an identifiable useful life  the  process is the same as for depreciation  only the name of the expense is different  IFRS state  that if a pattern cannot be determined over the useful life then the straight line method should  be used    In most cases under IFRS and US GAAP amortisable intangible assets are  amortised using the straight line method with no residual value  Goodwill   and intangible  assets with indefinite life are not amortised  Instead they are tested at least annually for  impairment  i e  if the current value of an intangible asset or goodwill is materially lower than  its value in the company s books the value of the asset is considered to be impaired and its  value in the company s books must be decreased

2,147,In summary to calculate depreciation and amortisation a company must choose a method  estimate the asset s useful life and estimate residual value  Clearly different choices have a  differing effect on depreciation or amortisation expense and therefore on reported net income 
3,147,     Implications for Financial Analysis
4,147,A company s estimates for doubtful accounts and or for warranty expenses can affect its  reported net income  Similarly a company s choice of depreciation or amortisation method  estimates of assets  useful lives and estimates of assets  residual values can affect reported net  income  These are only a few of the choices and estimates that affect a company s reported net  income 
5,147,As with revenue recognition policies a company s choice of expense recognition can be  characterized by its relative conservatism  A policy that results in recognition of expenses later  rather than sooner is considered less conservative  In addition many items of expense require  the company to make estimates that can significantly affect net income  Analysis of a  company s financial statements and particularly comparison of one company s financial  statements with those of another requires an understanding of differences in these estimates and  their potential impact 
6,147,If for example a company shows a significant year to year change in its estimates of  uncollectible accounts as a percentage of sales warranty expenses as a percentage of sales or  estimated useful lives of assets the analyst should seek to understand the underlying reasons   Do the changes reflect a change in business operations  e g  lower estimated warranty expenses  reflecting recent experience of fewer warranty claims because of improved product quality   Or  are the changes seemingly unrelated to changes in business operations and thus possibly a  signal that a company is manipulating estimates in order to achieve a particular effect on its  reported net income 
7,147,As another example if two companies in the same industry have dramatically different  estimates for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of their sales warranty expenses as a  percentage of sales or estimated useful lives as a percentage of assets it is important to  understand the underlying reasons  Are the differences consistent with differences in the two  companies  business operations  e g  lower uncollectible accounts for one company reflecting a  different more creditworthy customer base or possibly stricter credit policies   Another  difference consistent with differences in business operations would be a difference in estimated  useful lives of assets if one of the companies employs newer equipment  Or alternatively are  the differences seemingly inconsistent with differences in the two companies  business  operations possibly signaling that a company is manipulating estimates 
8,147,Information about a company s accounting policies and significant estimates are described in  the notes to the financial statements and in the management discussion and analysis section of a  company s annual report 
9,147,When possible the monetary effect of differences in expense recognition policies and estimates  can facilitate more meaningful comparisons with a single company s historical performance or  across a number of companies  An analyst can use the monetary effect to adjust the reported  expenses so that they are on a comparable basis

2,148,Even when the monetary effects of differences in policies and estimates cannot be calculated it  is generally possible to characterize the relative conservatism of the policies and estimates and  therefore to qualitatively assess how such differences might affect reported expenses and thus  financial ratios 
3,148,   NON RECURRING ITEMS AND NON  OPERATING ITEMS
4,148,From a company s income statements we can see its earnings from last year and in the previous  year  Looking forward the question is  What will the company earn next year and in the years  after 
5,148,To assess a company s future earnings it is helpful to separate those prior years  items of  income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely  to continue    Some items from prior years are clearly not expected to continue in the future  periods and are separately disclosed on a company s income statement  This is consistent with   An entity shall present additional line items headings and subtotals   when such  presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity s financial performance     IFRS  describe considerations that enter into the decision to present information other than that  explicitly specified by a standard  US GAAP specify some of the items that should be reported  separately  Two such items are    discontinued operations and    extraordinary items  the latter  category is not permitted under IFRS   These two items if applicable must be reported  separately from continuing operations under US GAAP    US GAAP for fiscal periods  beginning after December         will no longer include the concept of extraordinary items   Other items that may be reported separately on a company s income statement such as unusual  items items that occur infrequently effects due to accounting changes and non operating  income require the analyst to make some judgments 
6,148,     Discontinued Operations
7,148,When a company disposes of or establishes a plan to dispose of one of its component operations  and will have no further involvement in the operation the income statement reports separately  the effect of this disposal as a  discontinued  operation under both IFRS and US GAAP   Financial standards provide various criteria for reporting the effect separately which are  generally that the discontinued component must be separable both physically and  operationally   
8,148,Because the discontinued operation will no longer provide earnings  or cash flow  to the  company an analyst can eliminate discontinued operations in formulating expectations about a  company s future financial performance

3,150,     Unusual or Infrequent Items
4,150,IFRS require that items of income or expense that are material and or relevant to the  understanding of the entity s financial performance should be disclosed separately  Unusual or  infrequent items are likely to meet these criteria  Under US GAAP material items that are  unusual or infrequent and that are both as of reporting periods beginning after December          are shown as part of a company s continuing operations but are presented separately  For  example restructuring charges such as costs to close plants and employee termination costs  are considered part of a company s ordinary activities  As another example gains and losses  arising when a company sells an asset or part of a business for more or less than its carrying  value are also disclosed separately on the income statement  These sales are considered  ordinary business activities 
5,150,Highlighting the unusual or infrequent nature of these items assists an analyst in judging the  likelihood that such items will reoccur  This meets the IFRS criteria of disclosing items that are  relevant to the understanding of an entity s financial performance  Exhibit    shows such  disclosure

2,151,     Changes in Accounting Policies
3,151,At times standard setters issue new standards that require companies to change accounting  policies  Companies may be permitted to adopt the standards prospectively  in the future  or  retrospectively  restate financial statements as though the standard existed in the past   In other  cases changes in accounting policies  e g  from one acceptable inventory costing method to  another  are made for other reasons such as providing a better reflection of the company s  performance  Changes in accounting policies are reported through retrospective application   unless it is impractical to do so 
4,151,Retrospective application means that the financial statements for all fiscal years shown in a  company s financial report are presented as if the newly adopted accounting principle had been  used throughout the entire period  Notes to the financial statements describe the change and  explain the justification for the change  Because changes in accounting principles are  retrospectively applied the financial statements that appear within a financial report are  comparable  So if a company s annual report for      includes its financial statements for  fiscal years           and      all of these statements will be comparable

2,152,The new accounting principles generally require the Company to  account for the sale of both iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables   The first deliverable is the hardware and software delivered at the time of  sale and the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of  iPhone and Apple TV to receive on a when and if available basis future  unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product s  software  The new accounting principles result in the recognition of  substantially all of the revenue and product costs from sales of iPhone  and Apple TV at the time of sale  Additionally the Company is required  to estimate a standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade  right included with the sale of iPhone and Apple TV and recognizes that  amount ratably over the    month estimated life of the related hardware  device  For all periods presented the Company s estimated selling price for  the software upgrade right included with each iPhone and Apple TV sold is      and     respectively  The adoption of the new accounting principles  increased the Company s net sales by      billion      billion and       million for           and      respectively  As of September          the revised total accumulated deferred revenue associated with iPhone and  Apple TV sales to date was      million  revised accumulated deferred  costs for such sales were zero

4,152,   Under the historical accounting principle how would the revenue from a sale of  an iPhone be reflected in Apple s financial statements 
5,152,   How and why did adoption of the new accounting principles affect Apple s  revenues in      
6,152,Solution to   
7,152,Under the historical accounting principle  standard  a sale of an iPhone was treated as a  subscription sale and revenue was not recognized at the time of sale  Rather the sale  would result in a liability entitled  deferred revenue   In subsequent periods the  company would recognize as revenue a portion of the revenue from that sale and reduce  the amount of deferred revenue by the same amount  Disclosures about deferred revenue  can be helpful to an analyst in developing expectations about future revenues 
8,152,Solution to   
9,152,Adoption of the new accounting principles  standards  increased the company s       net sales  revenue  by      billion  The reason for the increase is that the new standard  allowed the company to separate the revenue from the iPhone into two separate  components and to report revenue from them separately

2,153,In years prior to      under both IFRS and US GAAP the cumulative effect of changes in  accounting policies was typically shown at the bottom of the income statement in the year of  change instead of using retrospective application  It is possible that future accounting standards  may occasionally require a company to report the change differently than retrospective  application  Note disclosures are required to explain how the transition from the old standard to  the new one is handled  During the period when companies make the transition from the old  standard to the new an analyst can examine disclosures to ensure comparability across  companies 
3,153,In contrast to changes in accounting policies  such as whether to expense the cost of employee  stock options  companies sometimes make changes in accounting estimates  such as the useful  life of a depreciable asset   Changes in accounting estimates are handled prospectively with the  change affecting the financial statements for the period of change and future periods  No  adjustments are made to prior statements and the adjustment is not shown on the face of the  income statement  Significant changes should be disclosed in the notes 
4,153,Another possible adjustment is a correction of an error for a prior period  e g  in financial  statements issued for an earlier year   This cannot be handled by simply adjusting the current  period income statement  Correction of an error for a prior period is handled by restating the  financial statements  including the balance sheet statement of owners  equity and cash flow  statement  for the prior periods presented in the current financial statements    Note disclosures  are required regarding the error  These disclosures should be examined carefully because they  may reveal weaknesses in the company s accounting systems and financial controls 
5,153,     Non Operating Items
6,153,Non operating items are typically reported separately from operating income because they are  material and or relevant to the understanding of the entity s financial performance  Under IFRS  there is no definition of operating activities and companies that choose to report operating  income or the results of operating activities should ensure that these represent activities that are  normally regarded as operating  Under US GAAP operating activities generally involve  producing and delivering goods and providing services and include all transactions and other  events that are not defined as investing or financing activities    For example if a non financial  service company invests in equity or debt securities issued by another company any interest  dividends or profits from sales of these securities will be shown as non operating income  In  general for non financial services companies   non operating income that is disclosed  separately on the income statement  or in the notes  includes amounts earned through investing  activities

2,154,Among non operating items on the income statement  or accompanying notes  non financial  service companies also disclose the interest expense on their debt securities including  amortisation of any discount or premium  The amount of interest expense is related to the  amount of a company s borrowings and is generally described in the notes to the financial  statements  For financial service companies interest income and expense are likely components  of operating activities   Note that the characterization of interest and dividends as non operating  items on the income statement is not necessarily consistent with the classification on the  statement of cash flows  Specifically under IFRS interest and dividends received can be shown  either as operating or as investing on the statement of cash flows while under US GAAP  interest and dividends received are shown as operating cash flows  Under IFRS interest and  dividends paid can be shown either as operating or as financing on the statement of cash flows  while under US GAAP interest paid is shown as operating and dividends paid are shown as  financing  
3,154,In practice investing and financing activities may be disclosed on a net basis with the  components disclosed separately in the notes  In its income statement for       Exhibit     Groupe Danone for example disclosed net interest expense  cost of net debt  of      million   The net amount is the      million of interest expense minus     million interest revenue  The  financial statement notes  not shown  provide further disclosure about the expense 
4,154,For purposes of assessing a company s future performance the amount of financing expense  will depend on the company s financing policy  target capital structure  and borrowing costs   The amount of investing income will depend on the purpose and success of investing activities   For a non financial company a significant amount of financial income would typically warrant  further exploration  What are the reasons underlying the company s investments in the  securities of other companies  Is the company simply investing excess cash in short term  securities to generate income higher than cash deposits or is the company purchasing securities  issued by other companies for strategic reasons such as access to raw material supply or  research 
5,154,   EARNINGS PER SHARE
6,154,One metric of particular importance to an equity investor is earnings per share  EPS   EPS is an  input into ratios such as the price earnings ratio  Additionally each shareholder in a company  owns a different number of shares  IFRS require the presentation of EPS on the face of the  income statement for net profit or loss  net income  and profit or loss  income  from continuing  operations    Similar presentation is required under US GAAP    This section outlines the  calculations for EPS and explains how the calculation differs for a simple versus complex  capital structure

2,155,A company s capital is composed of its equity and debt  Some types of equity have preference  over others and some debt  and other instruments  may be converted into equity  Under IFRS  the type of equity for which EPS is presented is referred to as ordinary  Ordinary shares are  those equity shares that are subordinate to all other types of equity  The ordinary shareholders  are basically the owners of the company the equity holders who are paid last in a liquidation  of the company and who benefit the most when the company does well  Under US GAAP this  ordinary equity is referred to as common stock or common shares reflecting US language  usage  The terms  ordinary shares   common stock  and  common shares  are used  interchangeably in the following discussion 
3,155,When a company has issued any financial instruments that are potentially convertible into  common stock it is said to have a complex capital structure  Examples of financial instruments  that are potentially convertible into common stock include convertible bonds convertible  preferred stock employee stock options and warrants    If a company s capital structure does  not include such potentially convertible financial instruments it is said to have a simple capital  structure 
4,155,The distinction between simple versus complex capital structure is relevant to the calculation of  EPS because financial instruments that are potentially convertible into common stock could as  a result of conversion or exercise potentially dilute  i e  decrease  EPS  Information about such  a potential dilution is valuable to a company s current and potential shareholders  therefore  accounting standards require companies to disclose what their EPS would be if all dilutive  financial instruments were converted into common stock  The EPS that would result if all  dilutive financial instruments were converted is called diluted EPS  In contrast basic EPS is  calculated using the reported earnings available to common shareholders of the parent company  and the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
5,155,Companies are required to report both basic and diluted EPS  For example Danone reported  basic EPS   before dilution   and diluted EPS   after dilution   of       for      somewhat  lower than       Kraft reported basic EPS of       and diluted EPS of       for      much  higher than basic and diluted EPS  from continuing operations  of       and       for         The EPS information appears at the bottom of Danone s and Kraft s income statements   An  analyst would try to determine the causes underlying the changes in EPS a topic we will  address following an explanation of the calculations of both basic and diluted EPS 
6,155,     Basic EPS
7,155,Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted  average number of common shares outstanding over a period  The amount of income available  to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends  if  any  have been paid  Thus the formula to calculate basic EPS is 
8,155,Equation    
9,155,Basic EPS

2,156,The weighted average number of shares outstanding is a time weighting of common shares  outstanding  For example assume a company began the year with         common shares  outstanding and repurchased        common shares on   July  The weighted average number  of common shares outstanding would be the sum of         shares       year            shares       year or         shares  So the company would use         shares as the  weighted average number of shares in calculating its basic EPS 
3,156,If the number of shares of common stock increases as a result of a stock dividend or a stock  split the EPS calculation reflects the change retroactively to the beginning of the period 
4,156,Examples       and    illustrate the computation of basic EPS

9,157,Solution 
10,157,For EPS calculation purposes a stock split is treated as if it occurred at the beginning of  the period  The weighted average number of shares would therefore be         and  the basic EPS would be                                        
11,157,     Diluted EPS
12,157,If a company has a simple capital structure  in other words one that includes no potentially  dilutive financial instruments  then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS  However if a  company has potentially dilutive financial instruments its diluted EPS may differ from its basic  EPS  Diluted EPS by definition is always equal to or less than basic EPS  The sections below  describe the effects of three types of potentially dilutive financial instruments on diluted EPS   convertible preferred convertible debt and employee stock options  The final section explains  why not all potentially dilutive financial instruments actually result in a difference between  basic and diluted EPS

2,158,       Diluted EPS When a Company Has Convertible Preferred Stock  Outstanding
3,158,When a company has convertible preferred stock outstanding diluted EPS is calculated using  the if converted method  The if converted method is based on what EPS would have been if  the convertible preferred securities had been converted at the beginning of the period  In other  words the method calculates what the effect would have been if the convertible preferred shares  converted at the beginning of the period  If the convertible shares had been converted there  would be two effects  First the convertible preferred securities would no longer be outstanding   instead additional common stock would be outstanding  Thus under the if converted method  the weighted average number of shares outstanding would be higher than in the basic EPS  calculation  Second if such a conversion had taken place the company would not have paid  preferred dividends  Thus under the if converted method the net income available to common  shareholders would be higher than in the basic EPS calculation 
4,158,Diluted EPS using the if converted method for convertible preferred stock is equal to net  income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding from the basic EPS  calculation plus the additional shares of common stock that would be issued upon conversion of  the preferred  Thus the formula to calculate diluted EPS using the if converted method for  preferred stock is

16,159,When a company has convertible debt outstanding the diluted EPS calculation also uses the if  converted method  Diluted EPS is calculated as if the convertible debt had been converted at the  beginning of the period  If the convertible debt had been converted the debt securities would no  longer be outstanding  instead additional shares of common stock would be outstanding  Also  if such a conversion had taken place the company would not have paid interest on the  convertible debt so the net income available to common shareholders would increase by the  after tax amount of interest expense on the debt converted

5,161,       Diluted EPS When a Company Has Stock Options Warrants or  Their Equivalents Outstanding
6,161,When a company has stock options warrants or their equivalents   outstanding diluted EPS is  calculated as if the financial instruments had been exercised and the company had used the  proceeds from exercise to repurchase as many shares of common stock as possible at the  average market price of common stock during the period  The weighted average number of  shares outstanding for diluted EPS is thus increased by the number of shares that would be  issued upon exercise minus the number of shares that would have been purchased with the  proceeds  This method is called the treasury stock method under US GAAP because  companies typically hold repurchased shares as treasury stock  The same method is used under  IFRS but is not named 
7,161,For the calculation of diluted EPS using this method the assumed exercise of these financial  instruments would have the following effects 
8,161,  The company is assumed to receive cash upon exercise and in exchange to issue shares 
9,161,  The company is assumed to use the cash proceeds to repurchase shares at the weighted  average market price during the period 
10,161,As a result of these two effects the number of shares outstanding would increase by the  incremental number of shares issued  the difference between the number of shares issued to the  holders and the number of shares assumed to be repurchased by the company   For calculating  diluted EPS the incremental number of shares is weighted based upon the length of time the  financial instrument was outstanding in the year  If the financial instrument was issued prior to  the beginning of the year the weighted average number of shares outstanding increases by the  incremental number of shares  If the financial instruments were issued during the year then the  incremental shares are weighted by the amount of time the financial instruments were  outstanding during the year 
11,161,The assumed exercise of these financial instruments would not affect net income  For  calculating EPS therefore no change is made to the numerator  The formula to calculate  diluted EPS using the treasury stock method  same method as used under IFRS but not named   for options is

8,162,Solution 
9,162,Using the treasury stock method we first calculate that the company would have  received               for each of the       options exercised  if all the options had  been exercised  The options would no longer be outstanding  instead       shares of  common stock would be outstanding  Under the treasury stock method we assume that  shares would be repurchased with the cash received upon exercise of the options  At an  average market price of     per share the          proceeds from option exercise  the company could have repurchased       shares  Therefore the incremental number  of shares issued is        calculated as       minus         For the diluted EPS  calculation no change is made to the numerator  As shown in Exhibit    the company s  basic EPS was       and the diluted EPS was

10,163,As noted IFRS require a similar computation but does not refer to it as the  treasury stock  method   The company is required to consider that any assumed proceeds are received from the  issuance of new shares at the average market price for the period  These new  inferred  shares  would be disregarded in the computation of diluted EPS but the excess of the new shares that  would be issued under options contracts minus the new inferred shares would be added to the  weighted average number of shares outstanding  The results are the same as the treasury stock  method as shown in Example    
11,163,EXAMPLE   
12,163,Diluted EPS for Options under IFRS
13,163,Assuming the same facts as in Example    calculate the weighted average number of  shares outstanding for diluted EPS under IFRS 
14,163,Solution 
15,163,If the options had been exercised the company would have received           If this  amount had been received from the issuance of new shares at the average market price  of     per share the company would have issued       shares  IFRS refer to the        shares the company would have issued at market prices as the inferred shares   The number of shares issued under options         minus the number of inferred shares          equals        This amount is added to the weighted average number of shares  outstanding of        to get diluted shares of         Note that this is the same result  as that obtained under US GAAP  it is just derived in a different manner

2,164,       Other Issues with Diluted EPS
3,164,It is possible that some potentially convertible securities could be antidilutive  i e  their  inclusion in the computation would result in an EPS higher than the company s basic EPS    Under IFRS and US GAAP antidilutive securities are not included in the calculation of diluted  EPS  Diluted EPS should reflect the maximum potential dilution from conversion or exercise of  potentially dilutive financial instruments  Diluted EPS will always be less than or equal to basic  EPS  Example    provides an illustration of an antidilutive security 
4,164,EXAMPLE   
5,164,An Antidilutive Security
6,164,For the year ended    December      Dim Cool Utility Company had net income of            The company had an average of        shares of common stock  outstanding       shares of convertible preferred and no other potentially dilutive  securities  Each share of preferred pays a dividend of     per share and each is  convertible into three shares of the company s common stock  What was the company s  basic and diluted EPS 
7,164,Solution 
8,164,If the       shares of convertible preferred had each converted into   shares of the  company s common stock the company would have had an additional       shares of  common stock    shares of common for each of the       shares of preferred   If the  conversion had taken place the company would not have paid preferred dividends of               per share for each of the       shares of preferred   The effect of using  the if converted method would be EPS of       as shown in Exhibit     Because this is  greater than the company s basic EPS of       the securities are said to be antidilutive  and the effect of their conversion would not be included in diluted EPS  Diluted EPS  would be the same as basic EPS  i e

9,165,     Changes in EPS
10,165,Having explained the calculations of both basic and diluted EPS we return to an examination of  changes in EPS  As noted above Kraft s fully diluted EPS from continuing operations  increased from       in      to       in       One cause of the increase in EPS is found in the  notes to the financial statements  not shown   The note describing the calculation of EPS  indicates that the number of weighted average shares decreased and another note indicates that  one reason for the decrease was the company s repurchase of some of its own shares during the  year  A more important cause of the increase in EPS shown on the income statement  itself was the significant increase in earnings from continuing operations from       million  to       million  Changes in the numerator and denominator explain the changes in EPS  arithmetically  To understand the business drivers of those changes requires further research   The next section presents analytical tools that an analyst can use to highlight areas for further  examination 
11,165,   ANALYSIS OF THE INCOME STATEMENT
12,165,In this section we apply two analytical tools to analyze the income statement  common size  analysis and income statement ratios  The objective of this analysis is to assess a company s  performance over a period of time compared with its own past performance or the  performance of another company

2,166,     Common Size Analysis of the Income Statement
3,166,Common size analysis of the income statement can be performed by stating each line item on  the income statement as a percentage of revenue    Common size statements facilitate  comparison across time periods  time series analysis  and across companies  cross sectional  analysis  because the standardization of each line item removes the effect of size 
4,166,To illustrate Panel A of Exhibit    presents an income statement for three hypothetical  companies in the same industry  Company A and Company B each with     million in sales  are larger  as measured by sales  than Company C which has only    million in sales  In  addition Companies A and B both have higher operating profit     million and      million  respectively compared with Company C s operating profit of only         
5,166,How can an analyst meaningfully compare the performance of these companies  By preparing a  common size income statement as illustrated in Panel B an analyst can readily see that the  percentages of Company C s expenses and profit relative to its sales are exactly the same as for  Company A  Furthermore although Company C s operating profit is lower than Company B s  in absolute dollars it is higher in percentage terms     percent for Company C compared with  only    percent for Company B   For each      of sales Company C generates    more  operating profit than Company B  In other words Company C is relatively more profitable than  Company B based on this measure 
6,166,The common size income statement also highlights differences in companies  strategies   Comparing the two larger companies Company A reports significantly higher gross profit as a  percentage of sales than does Company B     percent compared with    percent   Given that  both companies operate in the same industry why can Company A generate so much higher  gross profit  One possible explanation is found by comparing the operating expenses of the two  companies  Company A spends significantly more on research and development and on  advertising than Company B  Expenditures on research and development likely result in  products with superior technology  Expenditures on advertising likely result in greater brand  awareness  So based on these differences it is likely that Company A is selling technologically  superior products with a better brand image  Company B may be selling its products more  cheaply  with a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales  but saving money by not investing  in research and development or advertising  In practice differences across companies are more  subtle but the concept is similar  An analyst noting significant differences would do more  research and seek to understand the underlying reasons for the differences and their  implications for the future performance of the companies

6,167,Sales Cost of sales Gross profit Selling general and administrative expenses Research and development Advertising Operating profit
7,167,Note  Each line item is expressed as a percentage of the company s sales 
8,167,For most expenses comparison to the amount of sales is appropriate  However in the case of  taxes it is more meaningful to compare the amount of taxes with the amount of pretax income   Using note disclosure an analyst can then examine the causes for differences in effective tax  rates  To project the companies  future net income an analyst would project the companies   pretax income and apply an estimated effective tax rate determined in part by the historical tax  rates 
9,167,Vertical common size analysis of the income statement is particularly useful in cross sectional  analysis comparing companies with each other for a particular time period or comparing a  company with industry or sector data  The analyst could select individual peer companies for  comparison use industry data from published sources or compile data from databases based on  a selection of peer companies or broader industry data  For example Exhibit    presents  median common size income statement data compiled for the components of the S P      classified into the    S P MSCI Global Industrial Classification System  GICS  sectors using       data  Note that when compiling aggregate data such as this some level of aggregation is  necessary and less detail may be available than from peer company financial statements  The  performance of an individual company can be compared with industry or peer company data to  evaluate its relative performance

39,168,One aspect of financial performance is profitability  One indicator of profitability is net profit  margin also known as profit margin and return on sales which is calculated as net income  divided by revenue  or sales    
40,168,Net profit margin  
41,168,Net income Revenue
42,168,Net profit margin measures the amount of income that a company was able to generate for each  dollar of revenue  A higher level of net profit margin indicates higher profitability and is thus  more desirable  Net profit margin can also be found directly on the common size income  statements

2,169,For Kraft Foods net profit margin for      was     percent  calculated as earnings from  continuing operations net of non controlling interests of       million divided by net  revenues of        million   To judge this ratio some comparison is needed  Kraft s  profitability can be compared with that of another company or with its own previous  performance  Compared with previous years Kraft s profitability is higher than in      and  roughly equivalent to       In      net profit margin was     percent and in      it was      percent 
3,169,Another measure of profitability is the gross profit margin  Gross profit  gross margin  is  calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold and the gross profit margin is calculated as  the gross profit divided by revenue 
4,169,Gross profit margin  
5,169,Gross profit Revenue
6,169,The gross profit margin measures the amount of gross profit that a company generated for each  dollar of revenue  A higher level of gross profit margin indicates higher profitability and thus is  generally more desirable although differences in gross profit margins across companies reflect  differences in companies  strategies  For example consider a company pursuing a strategy of  selling a differentiated product  e g  a product differentiated based on brand name quality  superior technology or patent protection   The company would likely be able to sell the  differentiated product at a higher price than a similar but undifferentiated product and  therefore would likely show a higher gross profit margin than a company selling an  undifferentiated product  Although a company selling a differentiated product would likely  show a higher gross profit margin this may take time  In the initial stage of the strategy the  company would likely incur costs to create a differentiated product such as advertising or  research and development which would not be reflected in the gross margin calculation 
7,169,Kraft s gross profit  shown in Exhibit    was        million in             million in       and        million in       Expressing gross profit as a percentage of net revenues we see  that the gross profit margin was      percent in           percent in      and      percent in        In absolute terms Kraft s gross profit was higher in      than in       However Kraft s  gross profit margin was lower in      
8,169,Exhibit    presents a common size income statement for Kraft and highlights certain  profitability ratios  The net profit margin and gross profit margin described above are just two  of the many subtotals that can be generated from common size income statements  Other   margins  used by analysts include the operating profit margin  operating income divided by  revenue  and the pretax margin  earnings before taxes divided by revenue

2,171,The profitability ratios and the common size income statement yield quick insights about  changes in a company s performance  For example Kraft s increase in profitability in      was  not driven by an increase in revenues   In fact net revenues were lower than in        Instead  the company s improved profitability in      was driven primarily by its higher gross profit  margins  Given the economic climate in      the company likely had to lower prices and or  incur higher promotional costs in order to stimulate demand for its products  downward  pressure on net revenues   Another driver of the company s improved profitability in      was  a lower amount of asset impairment and exit costs  The profitability ratios and the common size  income statement thus serve to highlight areas about which an analyst might wish to gain  further understanding 
3,171,   COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
4,171,The general expression for net income is revenue minus expenses  There are however certain  items of revenue and expense that by accounting convention are excluded from the net income  calculation  To understand how reported shareholders  equity of one period links with reported  shareholders  equity of the next period we must understand these excluded items known as
5,171,other comprehensive income 
6,171,Under IFRS total comprehensive income is  the change in equity during a period resulting  from transaction and other events other than those changes resulting from transactions with  owners in their capacity as owners     Under US GAAP comprehensive income is defined  as  the change in equity  net assets  of a business enterprise during a period from transactions  and other events and circumstances from non owner sources  It includes all changes in equity  during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to  owners     While the wording differs comprehensive income includes the same items under  IFRS and US GAAP  So comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue  and expense items that are excluded from the net income calculation  other comprehensive  income   Assume for example a company s beginning shareholders  equity is      million its  net income for the year is     million its cash dividends for the year are    million and there  was no issuance or repurchase of common stock  If the company s actual ending shareholders   equity is      million then    million                            has bypassed the net income  calculation by being classified as other comprehensive income  If the company had no other  comprehensive income its ending shareholders  equity would have been      million                    
7,171,Four types of items are treated as other comprehensive income under both IFRS and US  GAAP     The specific treatment of some of these items differs between the two sets of  standards but these types of items are common to both  
8,171,  Foreign currency translation adjustments  In consolidating the financial statements of  foreign subsidiaries the effects of translating the subsidiaries  balance sheet assets and  liabilities at current exchange rates are included as other comprehensive income

2,172,  Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives contracts accounted for as hedges  Changes in  the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period but these changes in value for  certain derivatives  those considered hedges  are treated as other comprehensive income  and thus bypass the income statement 
3,172,  Unrealized holding gains and losses on a certain category of investment securities  namely available for sale securities 
4,172,  Certain costs of a company s defined benefit post retirement plans that are not recognized  in the current period 
5,172,In addition under IFRS other comprehensive income includes certain changes in the value of  long lived assets that are measured using the revaluation model rather than the cost model 
6,172,The third type of item is perhaps the simplest to illustrate  Holding gains on securities arise  when a company owns securities over an accounting period during which time the securities   value increases  Similarly holding losses on securities arise when a company owns securities  over a period during which time the securities  value decreases  If the company has not sold the  securities  i e  realized the gain or loss  its holding gain or loss is said to be unrealized  The  question is  Should the company reflect these unrealized holding gains and losses in its income  statement 
7,172,According to accounting standards the answer depends on how the company has categorized  the securities  Categorization depends on what the company intends to do with the securities  If  the company intends to actively trade the securities the answer is yes  the company should  categorize the securities as trading securities and reflect unrealized holding gains and losses  in its income statement  However if the company does not intend to actively trade the  securities the securities may be categorized as available for sale securities  For available for  sale securities the company does not reflect unrealized holding gains and losses in its profit and  loss statement  Instead unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  bypass the income statement and go directly to shareholders  equity through other  comprehensive income 
8,172,Even though unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded  from a company s net income they are included in a company s comprehensive income 
9,172,The  available for sale  classification no longer appears in IFRS with the issuance of IFRS     Financial Instruments  as of   January       Although the available for sale category will not  exist IFRS still permit certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with any  unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income  Specifically at  the time a company buys an equity investment that is not held for trading the company is  permitted to make an irrevocable election to measure the asset in this manner  These assets are  referred to as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income

11,172,Other Comprehensive Income
12,172,Assume a company s beginning shareholders  equity is      million its net income for  the year is     million its cash dividends for the year are    million and there was no  issuance or repurchase of common stock  The company s actual ending shareholders   equity is      million

9,173,C  Income earned from activities that are not part of the company s ordinary  business activities 
10,173,Solution to   
11,173,C is correct  If the company s actual ending shareholders  equity is      million then      million                           has bypassed the net income calculation by being  classified as other comprehensive income 
12,173,Solution to

6,174,Both IFRS and US GAAP currently provide companies with some flexibility in reporting  comprehensive income  IFRS currently allow companies two alternative presentations  either  two statements a separate income statement and a second statement additionally including  other comprehensive income or a single statement of other comprehensive income    US  GAAP give companies both of those alternatives plus another  Under US GAAP a company  can report comprehensive income at the bottom of the income statement on a separate  statement of comprehensive income or as a column in the statement of shareholders  equity    Particularly in comparing financial statements of two companies it is relevant to examine  significant differences in comprehensive income 
7,174,SUMMARY
8,174,This reading has presented the elements of income statement analysis  The income statement  presents information on the financial results of a company s business activities over a period of  time  it communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what  costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue  A company s net income and its  components  e g  gross margin operating earnings and pretax earnings  are critical inputs into  both the equity and credit analysis processes  Equity analysts are interested in earnings because  equity markets often reward relatively high  or low earnings growth companies with above  average or below average valuations respectively  Fixed income analysts examine the  components of income statements past and projected for information on companies  abilities to  make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle  Corporate  financial announcements frequently emphasize income statements more than the other financial  statements 
9,174,Key points to this reading include the following

2,175,  The income statement presents revenue expenses and net income 
3,175,  The components of the income statement include  revenue  cost of sales  sales general  and administrative expenses  other operating expenses  non operating income and  expenses  gains and losses  non recurring items  net income  and EPS 
4,175,  An income statement that presents a subtotal for gross profit  revenue minus cost of  goods sold  is said to be presented in a multi step format  One that does not present this  subtotal is said to be presented in a single step format 
5,175,  Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned which may or may not be in the same  period as the related cash collection  Recognition of revenue when earned is a  fundamental principal of accrual accounting 
6,175,  In limited circumstances specific revenue recognition methods may be applicable  including percentage of completion completed contract installment sales and cost  recovery 
7,175,  An analyst should identify differences in companies  revenue recognition methods and  adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate comparability  Where the available  information does not permit adjustment an analyst can characterize the revenue  recognition as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in  policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about profitability 
8,175,  In May      the IASB and FASB each issued a converged standard for revenue  recognition  The standards became effective for reporting periods beginning after    January      under IFRS and    December      under US GAAP  The core principle of  the converged standards is that revenue should be recognized to  depict the transfer of  promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to  which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services  
9,175,  To achieve the core principle the standard describes the application of five steps in  recognizing revenue  The standard also specifies the treatment of some related contract  costs and disclosure requirements 
10,175,  The general principles of expense recognition include a process to match expenses either  to revenue  such as cost of goods sold  or to the time period in which the expenditure  occurs  period costs such as administrative salaries  or to the time period of expected  benefits of the expenditures  such as depreciation  
11,175,  In expense recognition choice of method  i e  depreciation method and inventory cost  method  as well as estimates  i e  uncollectible accounts warranty expenses assets   useful life and salvage value  affect a company s reported income  An analyst should  identify differences in companies  expense recognition methods and adjust reported  financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability  Where the available  information does not permit adjustment an analyst can characterize the policies and  estimates as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in  policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies  performance 
12,175,  To assess a company s future earnings it is helpful to separate those prior years  items of  income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less  likely to continue

2,176,  Under IFRS a company should present additional line items headings and subtotals  beyond those specified when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the  entity s financial performance  Some items from prior years clearly are not expected to  continue in future periods and are separately disclosed on a company s income statement   Under US GAAP unusual and or infrequently occurring items which are material are  presented separately within income from continuing operations 
3,176,  Non operating items are reported separately from operating items on the income  statement  Under both IFRS and US GAAP the income statement reports separately the  effect of the disposal of a component operation as a  discontinued  operation 
4,176,  Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the  weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period  The amount of  income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after  preferred dividends  if any  have been paid 
5,176,  If a company has a simple capital structure  i e  one with no potentially dilutive  securities  then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS  If however a company has  dilutive securities its diluted EPS is lower than its basic EPS 
6,176,  Diluted EPS is calculated using the if converted method for convertible securities and the  treasury stock method for options 
7,176,  Common size analysis of the income statement involves stating each line item on the  income statement as a percentage of sales  Common size statements facilitate comparison  across time periods and across companies of different sizes 
8,176,  Two income statement based indicators of profitability are net profit margin and gross  profit margin 
9,176,  Comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue and expense items  that are excluded from the net income calculation

6,183,SOLUTIONS
7,183,   C is correct  IAS No    states that expenses may be categorized by either nature or  function 
8,183,   C is correct  Cost of goods sold is a classification by function  The other two expenses  represent classifications by nature 
9,183,   C is correct  Gross margin is revenue minus cost of goods sold  Answer A represents net  income and B represents operating income 
10,183,   B is correct  Under IFRS income includes increases in economic benefits from increases  in assets enhancement of assets and decreases in liabilities 
11,183,   B is correct  Net revenue is revenue for goods sold during the period less any returns and  allowances or          minus                   
12,183,   C is correct  The preferred method is the percentage of completion method  The  completed contract method should be used under US GAAP only when the outcome  cannot be measured reliably  A method similar to but not referred to as the cost recovery  method is used under IFRS when the outcome cannot be measured reliably 
13,183,   A is correct  Under the completed contract method no revenue would be reported until  the project is completed 
14,183,   A is correct  The installment method apportions the cash receipt between cost recovered  and profit using the ratio of profit to sales value  i e                            percent   Argo will therefore recognize         in profit for                cash  received      percent  
15,183,   A is correct  Under the cost recovery method the company would not recognize any  profit until the cash amounts paid by the buyer exceeded Argo s cost of          
16,183,    C is correct  Revenue for barter transactions should be measured based on the fair value  of revenue from similar non barter transactions with unrelated parties 
17,183,    A is correct  Apex is not the owner of the goods and should only report its net  commission as revenue

2,184,    C is correct  Under the converged accounting standards the incremental costs of  obtaining a contract and certain costs incurred to fulfill a contract must be capitalized  If a  company expensed these incremental costs in the years prior to adopting the converged  standards all else being equal its profitability will appear higher under the converged  standards 
3,184,    B is correct  Under the first in first out  FIFO  method the first       units sold came  from the October purchases at     and the next      units sold came from the  November purchases at     
4,184,    C is correct  Under the weighted average cost method 
5,184,October purchases  November purchases    Total

9,184,    B is correct  The last in first out  LIFO  method is not permitted under IFRS  The other  two methods are permitted 
10,184,    A is correct  Straight line depreciation would be                       or        
11,184,    C is correct  Double declining balance depreciation would be              percent   twice the straight line rate   The residual value is not subtracted from the initial book  value to calculate depreciation  However the book value  carrying amount  of the asset  will not be reduced below the estimated residual value 
12,184,    C is correct  This would result in the highest amount of depreciation in the first year and  hence the lowest amount of net income relative to the other choices 
13,184,    A is correct  A fire may be infrequent but it would still be part of continuing operations  and reported in the profit and loss statement  Discontinued operations relate to a decision  to dispose of an operating division 
14,184,    C is correct  If a company changes an accounting policy the financial statements for all  fiscal years shown in a company s financial report are presented if practical as if the  newly adopted accounting policy had been used throughout the entire period  this  retrospective application of the change makes the financial results of any prior years  included in the report comparable  Notes to the financial statements describe the change  and explain the justification for the change 
15,184,    C is correct  The weighted average number of shares outstanding for      is           Basic earnings per share would be          divided by         or       
16,184,    B is correct  The formula to calculate diluted EPS is as follows 
17,184,Diluted EPS    Net income   Preferred dividends   Weighted average number of  shares outstanding    New shares that would have been issued at option exercise    Shares that could have been purchased with cash received upon exercise     Proportion  of year during which the financial instruments were outstanding

2,185,The underlying assumption is that outstanding options are exercised and then the  proceeds from the issuance of new shares are used to repurchase shares already  outstanding 
3,185,Proceeds from option exercise                          
4,185,Shares repurchased                       
5,185,The net increase in shares outstanding is thus                         Therefore the  diluted EPS for CWC                                         
6,185,    A is correct  Basic and diluted EPS are equal for a company with a simple capital  structure  A company that issues only common stock with no financial instruments that  are potentially convertible into common stock has a simple capital structure  Basic EPS is  calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
7,185,    B is correct  LB has warrants in its capital structure  if the exercise price is less than the  weighted average market price during the year the effect of their conversion is to  increase the weighted average number of common shares outstanding causing diluted  EPS to be lower than basic EPS  If the exercise price is equal to the weighted average  market price the number of shares issued equals the number of shares repurchased   Therefore the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is not affected  and diluted EPS equals basic EPS  If the exercise price is greater than the weighted  average market price the effect of their conversion is anti dilutive  As such they are not  included in the calculation of basic EPS  LB s basic EPS is                                          Stock dividends are treated as having been issued retroactively to  the beginning of the period 
8,185,    A is correct  With stock options the treasury stock method must be used  Under that  method the company would receive                       and would repurchase       shares                The shares for the denominator would be 
9,185,Shares outstanding Options exercises Treasury shares purchased Denominator
10,185,                            
11,185,    C is correct 
12,185,Diluted EPS    Net income   Weighted average number of shares outstanding   New  common shares that would have been issued at conversion 
13,185,                                       
14,185,       
15,185,The diluted EPS assumes that the preferred dividend is not paid and that the shares are  converted at the beginning of the period

2,186,    A is correct  When a company has stock options outstanding diluted EPS is calculated as  if the financial instruments had been exercised and the company had used the proceeds  from the exercise to repurchase as many shares possible at the weighted average market  price of common stock during the period  As a result the conversion of stock options  increases the number of common shares outstanding but has no effect on net income  available to common shareholders  The conversion of convertible debt increases the net  income available to common shareholders by the after tax amount of interest expense  saved  The conversion of convertible preferred shares increases the net income available  to common shareholders by the amount of preferred dividends paid  the numerator  becomes the net income 
3,186,    B is correct  Common size income statements facilitate comparison across time periods   time series analysis  and across companies  cross sectional analysis  by stating each line  item of the income statement as a percentage of revenue  The relative performance of  different companies can be more easily assessed because scaling the numbers removes  the effect of size  A common size income statement states each line item on the income  statement as a percentage of revenue  The standardization of each line item makes a  common size income statement useful for identifying differences in companies   strategies 
4,186,    C is correct  Comprehensive income includes both net income and other comprehensive  income 
5,186,Other comprehensive income   Unrealized gain on available for sale securities    Unrealized loss on derivatives accounted for as hedges   Foreign currency translation  gain on consolidation
6,186,     million      million      million

12,186,      million      million       million
13,186,Net income is     million so other comprehensive income is    million 
14,186,    A is correct  Other comprehensive income includes items that affect shareholders  equity  but are not reflected in the company s income statement  In consolidating the financial  statements of foreign subsidiaries the effects of translating the subsidiaries  balance sheet  assets and liabilities at current exchange rates are included as other comprehensive  income

2,191,Analysts should be aware that different items of assets and liabilities may be measured differently  For  example some items are measured at historical cost or a variation thereof and others at fair value   An  understanding of the measurement issues will facilitate analysis  The balance sheet measurement issues are  of course closely linked to the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement   Throughout this reading we describe and illustrate some of the linkages between the measurement issues  affecting the balance sheet and the revenue and expense recognition issues affecting the income statement 
3,191,This reading is organized as follows  In Section   we describe and give examples of the elements and  formats of balance sheets  Section   discusses current assets and current liabilities  Section   focuses on  assets and Section   focuses on liabilities  Section   describes the components of equity and illustrates the  statement of changes in shareholders  equity  Section   introduces balance sheet analysis  A summary of  the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple choice format conclude the reading

7,191,The financial position of a company is described in terms of its basic elements  assets liabilities and  equity  
8,191,  Assets  A  are what the company owns  or controls   More formally assets are resources controlled  by the company as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to  flow to the entity 
9,191,  Liabilities  L  are what the company owes  More formally liabilities represent obligations of a  company arising from past events the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of  economic benefits from the entity 
10,191,  Equity  E  represents the owners  residual interest in the company s assets after deducting its  liabilities  Commonly known as shareholders  equity or owners  equity equity is determined by  subtracting the liabilities from the assets of a company giving rise to the accounting equation  A   L    E or A   L   E 
11,191,The equation A   L   E is sometimes summarized as follows  The left side of the equation reflects the  resources controlled by the company and the right side reflects how those resources were financed  For all  financial statement items an item should only be recognized in the financial statements if it is probable that  any future economic benefit associated with the item will flow to or from the entity and if the item has a  cost or value that can be measured with reliability  
12,191,The balance sheet provides important information about a company s financial condition but the balance  sheet amounts of equity  assets net of liabilities  should not be viewed as a measure of either the market or  intrinsic value of a company s equity for several reasons  First the balance sheet under current accounting  standards is a mixed model with respect to measurement  Some assets and liabilities are measured based on  historical cost sometimes with adjustments whereas other assets and liabilities are measured based on a  current value  The measurement bases may have a significant effect on the amount reported  Second even  the items measured at current value reflect the value that was current at the end of the reporting period  The  values of those items obviously can change after the balance sheet is prepared  Third the value of a  company is a function of many factors including future cash flows expected to be generated by the  company and current market conditions  Important aspects of a company s ability to generate future cash  flows for example its reputation and management skills are not included in its balance sheet

2,193,SAP Group uses the title Statement of Financial Position consistent with IFRS and Apple uses the title  Balance Sheet  Despite their different titles both statements report the three basic elements  assets  liabilities and equity  Both companies are reporting on a consolidated basis i e  including all their  controlled subsidiaries  The numbers in SAP Group s balance sheet are in millions of euro and the  numbers in Apple s balance sheet are in millions of dollars 
3,193,Balance sheet information is as of a specific point in time  These exhibits are from the companies  annual  financial statements so the balance sheet information is as of the last day of their respective fiscal years   SAP Group s fiscal year is the same as the calendar year and the balance sheet information is as of     December  Apple s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September so the actual date changes from year  to year  About every six years Apple s fiscal year will include    weeks rather than    weeks  This feature  of Apple s fiscal year should be noted but in general the extra week is more relevant to evaluating  statements spanning a period of time  the income and cash flow statements  rather than the balance sheet  which captures information as of a specific point in time 
4,193,A company s ability to pay for its short term operating needs relates to the concept of liquidity  With  respect to a company overall liquidity refers to the availability of cash to meet those short term needs   With respect to a particular asset or liability liquidity refers to its  nearness to cash   A liquid asset is one  that can be easily converted into cash in a short period of time at a price close to fair market value  For  example a small holding of an actively traded stock is much more liquid than an asset such as a  commercial real estate property in a weak property market 
5,193,The separate presentation of current and non current assets and liabilities enables an analyst to examine a  company s liquidity position  at least as of the end of the fiscal period   Both IFRS and US GAAP require  that the balance sheet distinguish between current and non current assets and between current and non  current liabilities and present these as separate classifications  An exception to this requirement under  IFRS is that the current and non current classifications are not required if a liquidity based presentation  provides reliable and more relevant information  Presentations distinguishing between current and non  current elements are shown in Exhibits   and    Exhibit   in Section     shows a liquidity based  presentation 
6,193,     Current and Non Current Classification
7,193,Assets held primarily for the purpose of trading or expected to be sold used up or otherwise realized in  cash within one year or one operating cycle of the business whichever is greater after the reporting period  are classified as current assets  A company s operating cycle is the average amount of time that elapses  between acquiring inventory and collecting the cash from sales to customers  For a manufacturer this is the  average amount of time between acquiring raw materials and converting these into cash from a sale   Examples of companies that might be expected to have operating cycles longer than one year include those  operating in the tobacco distillery and lumber industries  Even though these types of companies often hold  inventories longer than one year the inventory is classified as a current asset because it is expected to be  sold within an operating cycle  Assets not expected to be sold or used up within one year or one operating  cycle of the business whichever is greater are classified as non current assets  long term long lived  assets  
8,193,Current assets are generally maintained for operating purposes and these assets include in addition to  cash items expected to be converted into cash  e g  trade receivables  used up  e g  office supplies  prepaid expenses  or sold  e g  inventories  in the current period  Current assets provide information about  the operating activities and the operating capability of the entity  For example the item  trade receivables   or  accounts receivable  would indicate that a company provides credit to its customers  Non current assets  represent the infrastructure from which the entity operates and are not consumed or sold in the current  period  Investments in such assets are made from a strategic and longer term perspective 
9,193,Similarly liabilities expected to be settled within one year or within one operating cycle of the business  whichever is greater after the reporting period are classified as current liabilities  The specific criteria for  classification of a liability as current include the following

2,194,  It is expected to be settled in the entity s normal operating cycle 
3,194,  It is held primarily for the purpose of being traded  
4,194,  It is due to be settled within one year after the balance sheet date  or
5,194,  The entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one  year after the balance sheet date  
6,194,IFRS specify that some current liabilities such as trade payables and some accruals for employee and other  operating costs are part of the working capital used in the entity s normal operating cycle  Such operating  items are classified as current liabilities even if they will be settled more than one year after the balance  sheet date  When the entity s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable its duration is assumed to  be one year  All other liabilities are classified as non current liabilities  Non current liabilities include  financial liabilities that provide financing on a long term basis 
7,194,The excess of current assets over current liabilities is called working capital  The level of working capital  tells analysts something about the ability of an entity to meet liabilities as they fall due  Although adequate  working capital is essential working capital should not be too large because funds may be tied up that  could be used more productively elsewhere 
8,194,A balance sheet with separately classified current and non current assets and liabilities is referred to as a  classified balance sheet  Classification also refers generally to the grouping of accounts into  subcategories  Both companies  balance sheets that are summarized in Exhibits   and   are classified  balance sheets  Although both companies  balance sheets present current assets before non current assets  and current liabilities before non current liabilities this is not required  IFRS does not specify the order or  format in which a company presents items on a current non current classified balance sheet 
9,194,     Liquidity Based Presentation
10,194,A liquidity based presentation rather than a current non current presentation is used when such a  presentation provides information that is reliable and more relevant  With a liquidity based presentation all  assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity 
11,194,Entities such as banks are candidates to use a liquidity based presentation  Exhibit   presents the assets  portion of the balance sheet of China Construction Bank a commercial bank based in Beijing that reports  using IFRS   The Bank s H shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  Stock Code       and the  Bank s A shares are listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange  Stock Code            Its balance sheet is  ordered using a liquidity based presentation  As shown the asset section begins with Cash and deposits  with central banks  Less liquid items such as fixed assets and land use rights appear near the bottom of the  asset listing

2,197,       Cash and Cash Equivalents
3,197,Cash equivalents are highly liquid short term investments that are so close to maturity  the risk is  minimal that their value will change significantly with changes in interest rates  Cash and cash equivalents  are financial assets  Financial assets in general are measured and reported at either amortised cost or  fair value  Amortised cost is the historical cost  initially recognised cost  of the asset adjusted for  amortisation and impairment  Under IFRS and US GAAP fair value is based on an exit price the price  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between two market  participants at the measurement date 
4,197,For cash and cash equivalents amortised cost and fair value are likely to be immaterially different   Examples of cash equivalents are demand deposits with banks and highly liquid investments  such as US  Treasury bills commercial paper and money market funds  with original maturities of three months or  less  Cash and cash equivalents excludes amounts that are restricted in use for at least    months  For all  companies the Statement of Cash Flows presents information about the changes in cash over a period  For  the fiscal year      SAP Group s cash and cash equivalents increased from       million to        million and Apple s cash and cash equivalents decreased from        million to       million 
5,197,       Marketable Securities
6,197,Marketable securities are also financial assets and include investments in debt or equity securities that are  traded in a public market and whose value can be determined from price information in a public market   Examples of marketable securities include treasury bills notes bonds and equity securities such as  common stocks and mutual fund shares  Companies disclose further detail in the notes to their financial  statements about their holdings  For example SAP Group discloses that its other financial assets consist  mainly of time deposits investment in insurance policies and loans to employees  Apple s short term  marketable securities totaling       billion and       billion at the end of fiscal      and       respectively consist of fixed income securities with a maturity of less than one year  Financial assets such  as investments in debt and equity securities involve a variety of measurement issues and will be addressed  in Section     
7,197,       Trade Receivables
8,197,Trade receivables also referred to as accounts receivable are another type of financial asset  These are  amounts owed to a company by its customers for products and services already delivered  They are  typically reported at net realisable value an approximation of fair value based on estimates of  collectability  Several aspects of accounts receivable are usually relevant to an analyst  First the overall  level of accounts receivable relative to sales  a topic to be addressed further in ratio analysis  is important  because a significant increase in accounts receivable relative to sales could signal that the company is  having problems collecting cash from its customers 
9,197,A second relevant aspect of accounts receivable is the allowance for doubtful accounts  The allowance for  doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of amounts that will ultimately be uncollectible   Additions to the allowance in a particular period are reflected as bad debt expenses and the balance of the  allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the gross receivables amount to a net amount that is an estimate of  fair value  When specific receivables are deemed to be uncollectible they are written off by reducing  accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  The allowance for doubtful accounts is called  a contra account because it is netted against  i e  reduces  the balance of accounts receivable which is  an asset account  SAP Group s balance sheet for example reports current net trade and other receivables  of       million as of    December       The amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts       million  is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  Apple discloses the allowance for doubtful  accounts on the balance sheet  as of    September      the allowance was     million  The        million of accounts receivable on that date is net of the allowance  Apple s disclosures state that the  allowance is based on  historical experience the age of the accounts receivable balances credit quality of  the Company s customers current economic conditions and other factors that may affect customers   ability to pay   The age of an accounts receivable balance refers to the length of time the receivable has  been outstanding including how many days past the due date

2,198,Another relevant aspect of accounts receivable is the concentration of credit risk  For example SAP  Group s note on trade and other receivables discloses that concentration of credit risk is limited because  they have a large customer base diversified across various industries and countries and because no single  customer accounted for    percent or more of either revenue or receivables 
3,198,EXAMPLE  
4,198,Analysis of Accounts Receivable
5,198,   Based on the balance sheet excerpt for Apple Inc  in Exhibit   what percentage of its total  accounts receivable in      and      does Apple estimate will be uncollectible 
6,198,   In general how does the amount of allowance for doubtful accounts relate to bad debt  expense 
7,198,   In general what are some factors that could cause a company s allowance for doubtful  accounts to decrease 
8,198,Solution to   
9,198,   millions  The percentage of      accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible is      percent calculated as                    Note that the       is net of the     allowance so the  gross amount of accounts receivable is determined by adding the allowance to the net amount  The  percentage of      accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible is     percent                      
10,198,Solution to   
11,198,Bad debt expense is an expense of the period based on a company s estimate of the percentage of  credit sales in the period for which cash will ultimately not be collected  The allowance for bad  debts is a contra asset account which is netted against the asset accounts receivable 
12,198,To record the estimated bad debts a company recognizes a bad debt expense  which affects net  income  and increases the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts by the same amount  To  record the write off of a particular account receivable a company reduces the balance in the  allowance for doubtful accounts and reduces the balance in accounts receivable by the same  amount 
13,198,Solution to   
14,198,In general a decrease in a company s allowance for doubtful accounts in absolute terms could be  caused by a decrease in the amount of credit sales 
15,198,Some factors that could cause a company s allowance for doubtful accounts to decrease as a  percentage of accounts receivable include the following 
16,198,  Improvements in the credit quality of the company s existing customers  whether driven by a  customer specific improvement or by an improvement in the overall economy  
17,198,  Stricter credit policies  for example refusing to allow less creditworthy customers to make  credit purchases and instead requiring them to pay cash to provide collateral or to provide  some additional form of financial backing   and or
18,198,  Stricter risk management policies  for example buying more insurance against potential  defaults

2,199,In addition to the business factors noted above because the allowance is based on management s  estimates of collectability management can potentially bias these estimates to manipulate reported  earnings  For example a management team aiming to increase reported income could intentionally  over estimate collectability and under estimate the bad debt expense for a period  Conversely in a  period of good earnings management could under estimate collectability and over estimate the bad  debt expense with the intent of reversing the bias in a period of poorer earnings 
3,199,       Inventories
4,199,Inventories are physical products that will eventually be sold to the company s customers either in their  current form  finished goods  or as inputs into a process to manufacture a final product  raw materials and  work in process   Like any manufacturer Apple holds inventories  The      balance sheet of Apple Inc   shows      million of inventories  SAP Group s balance sheet does not include a line item for inventory  but its note disclosures indicate that inventory is included as a part of other non financial assets on its  balance sheet  SAP Group is primarily a software and services provider and the amount of its inventory is  not material enough to require disclosure as a separate line item on the balance sheet 
5,199,Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value under IFRS and depending upon  inventory method under US GAAP  The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase costs of  conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition  The  following amounts are excluded from the determination of inventory costs 
6,199,  abnormal amounts of wasted materials labor and overheads 
7,199,  storage costs unless they are necessary prior to a further production process 
8,199,  administrative overheads  and
9,199,  selling costs 
10,199,The following techniques can be used to measure the cost of inventories if the resulting valuation amount  approximates cost 
11,199,  Standard cost which should take into account the normal levels of materials labor and actual  capacity  The standard cost should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it approximates actual costs 
12,199,  The retail method in which the sales value is reduced by the gross margin to calculate cost  An  average gross margin percentage should be used for each homogeneous group of items  In addition  the impact of marked down prices should be taken into consideration 
13,199,Net realisable value  NRV  the measure used by IFRS is the estimated selling price less the estimated  costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale  Under US GAAP inventories were measured at  the lower of cost or market value  Market value is current replacement cost but with upper and lower  limits  It cannot exceed NRV and cannot be lower than NRV less a normal profit margin  Under US  GAAP inventories measured using other than last in first out and retail inventory methods are measured  at the lower of cost and NRV 
14,199,If the net realisable value  under IFRS  or market value  under US GAAP  of a company s inventory falls  below its carrying amount the company must write down the value of the inventory  The loss in value is  reflected in the income statement  For example within its Management s Discussion and Analysis and  notes Apple indicates that the company reviews its inventory each quarter and records write downs of  inventory that has become obsolete exceeds anticipated demand or is carried at a value higher than its  market value  Under IFRS if inventory that was written down in a previous period subsequently increases  in value the amount of the original write down is reversed  Subsequent reversal of an inventory write  down is not permitted under US GAAP

2,200,When inventory is sold the cost of that inventory is reported as an expense  cost of goods sold    Accounting standards allow different valuation methods for determining the amounts that are included in  cost of goods sold on the income statement and thus the amounts that are reported in inventory on the  balance sheet   Inventory valuation methods are referred to as cost formulas and cost flow assumptions  under IFRS and US GAAP respectively   IFRS allows only the first in first out  FIFO  weighted average  cost and specific identification methods  Some accounting standards  such as US GAAP  also allow last  in first out  LIFO  as an additional inventory valuation method  The LIFO method is not allowed under  IFRS 
3,200,EXAMPLE  
4,200,Analysis of Inventory
5,200,Cisco Systems is a global provider of networking equipment  In its third quarter      Form    Q  filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission  US SEC  on   June      the company  made the following disclosure 
6,200,We recorded a provision for inventory including purchase commitments totaling        billion in the third quarter of fiscal      of which       billion related to an  additional excess inventory charge  Inventory purchases and commitments are based  upon future sales forecasts  To mitigate the component supply constraints that have  existed in the past we built inventory levels for certain components with long lead  times and entered into certain longer term commitments for certain components  Due  to the sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products inventory levels  exceeded our requirements based on current    month sales forecasts  This additional  excess inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of     month demand for each specific product  We do not currently anticipate that the excess  inventory subject to this provision will be used at a later date based on our current     month demand forecast 
7,200,After the inventory charge Cisco reported approximately    billion of inventory on the balance  sheet suggesting that the write off amounted to approximately half of its inventory  In addition to  the obvious concerns raised as to management s poor performance in anticipating how much  inventory was required many analysts were concerned about how the write off would affect  Cisco s future reported earnings  If this inventory is sold in a future period a  gain  could be  reported based on a lower cost basis for the inventory  In this case management indicated that the  intent was to scrap the inventory  When the company subsequently released its annual earnings the  press release stated  
8,200,Net sales for fiscal      were        billion compared with        billion for fiscal       an increase of      Pro forma net income which excludes the effects of  acquisition charges payroll tax on stock option exercises restructuring costs and other  special charges excess inventory charge  benefit  and net gains realized on minority  investments was       billion or       per share for fiscal      compared with pro  forma net income of       billion or       per share for fiscal      decreases of      and     respectively 
9,200,Actual net loss for fiscal      was       billion or       per share compared with  actual net income of       billion or       per share for fiscal      
10,200,   What concerns would an analyst likely have about the company s      billion write off of  inventory  What is the significance of the company indicating its intent to scrap the written  off inventory 
11,200,   What concerns might an analyst have about the company s earnings press release when the  company subsequently released its annual earnings

2,201,Solution to   
3,201,First an analyst would likely have concerns about management s abilities to anticipate how much  and what type of inventory was required  While errors in forecasting demand are understandable  the amount of inventory written off represented about half of the company s inventory  A second  concern would relate to how the write off would affect the company s future reported earnings  If  the inventory that had been written off were sold in a future period a  gain  could be reported  based on a lower cost basis for the inventory  The company s intent to scrap the written off  inventory would alleviate but not eliminate concerns about distortions to future reported earnings 
4,201,Solution to   
5,201,An analyst might be concerned that the company s press release focused mainly on  pro forma  earnings  which excluded the impact of many items including the inventory write off  The  company only gave a brief mention of actual  US GAAP  results 
6,201,Note  A      SEC regulation now requires companies to give at least equal emphasis to GAAP measures  for example  reported net income  when using a non GAAP measure  for example pro forma net income  and to provide a  reconciliation of the two measures  
7,201,       Other Current Assets
8,201,The amounts shown in  other current assets  reflect items that are individually not material enough to  require a separate line item on the balance sheet and so are aggregated into a single amount  Companies  usually disclose the components in a note to the financial statements  A typical item included in other  current assets is prepaid expenses  Prepaid expenses are normal operating expenses that have been paid  in advance  Because expenses are recognized in the period in which they are incurred and not necessarily  the period in which the payment is made the advance payment of a future expense creates an asset  The  asset  prepaid expenses  will be recognized as an expense in future periods as it is used up  For example  consider prepaid insurance  Assume a company pays its insurance premium for coverage over the next  calendar year on    December of the current year  At the time of the payment the company recognizes an  asset  prepaid insurance expense   The expense is not incurred at that date  the expense is incurred as time  passes  in this example one twelfth      in each following month   Therefore the expense is recognized  and the value of the asset is reduced in the financial statements over the course of the year 
9,201,Portions of the amounts shown as tax assets on SAP s balance sheet and deferred tax assets on Apple s  balance sheet represent income taxes incurred prior to the time that the income tax expense will be  recognized on the income statement  Deferred tax assets may result when the actual income tax payable based on income for tax purposes in a period exceeds the amount of income tax expense based on the  reported financial statement income due to temporary timing differences  For example a company may be  required to report certain income for tax purposes in the current period but to defer recognition of that  income for financial statement purposes to subsequent periods  In this case the company will pay income  tax as required by tax laws and the difference between the taxes payable and the tax expense related to the  income for which recognition was deferred on the financial statements will be reported as a deferred tax  asset  When the income is subsequently recognized on the income statement the related tax expense is also  recognised which will reduce the deferred tax asset

2,202,Also a company may claim certain expenses for financial statement purposes that it is only allowed to  claim in subsequent periods for tax purposes  In this case as in the previous example the financial  statement income before taxes is less than taxable income  Thus income taxes payable based on taxable  income exceeds income tax expense based on accounting net income before taxes  The difference is  expected to reverse in the future when the income reported on the financial statements exceeds the taxable  income as a deduction for the expense becomes allowed for tax purposes  Deferred tax assets may also  result from carrying forward unused tax losses and credits  these are not temporary timing differences    Deferred tax assets are only to be recognised if there is an expectation that there will be taxable income in  the future against which the temporary difference or carried forward tax losses or credits can be applied to  reduce taxes payable 
3,202,     Current Liabilities
4,202,Current liabilities are those liabilities that are expected to be settled in the entity s normal operating  cycle held primarily for trading or due to be settled within    months after the balance sheet date  Exhibit    and Exhibit   present balance sheet excerpts for SAP Group and Apple Inc  showing the line items for  the companies  current liabilities  Some of the common types of current liabilities including trade  payables financial liabilities accrued expenses and deferred income are discussed below

11,203,Trade payables also called accounts payable are amounts that a company owes its vendors for  purchases of goods and services  In other words these represent the unpaid amount as of the balance sheet  date of the company s purchases on credit  An issue relevant to analysts is the trend in overall levels of  trade payables relative to purchases  a topic to be addressed further in ratio analysis   Significant changes  in accounts payable relative to purchases could signal potential changes in the company s credit  relationships with its suppliers  The general term  trade credit  refers to credit provided to a company by  its vendors  Trade credit is a source of financing that allows the company to make purchases and then pay  for those purchases at a later date 
12,203,Notes payable are financial liabilities owed by a company to creditors including trade creditors and  banks through a formal loan agreement  Any notes payable loans payable or other financial liabilities that  are due within one year  or the operating cycle whichever is longer  appear in the current liability section  of the balance sheet  In addition any portions of long term liabilities that are due within one year  i e  the  current portion of long term liabilities  are also shown in the current liability section of the balance sheet   On SAP Group s balance sheet current liabilities include bank loans and other financial liabilities  Apple  Inc  does not have any current notes payable or loans payable 
13,203,Income taxes payable reflect taxes based on taxable income that have not yet been paid  SAP Group s  balance sheet shows      million of tax liabilities in its current liabilities  Apple Inc  s balance sheet does  not show a separate line item for current taxes payable  instead a note discloses that income taxes payable  of      million are included within the       million of  Accrued expenses   Accrued expenses  also  called accrued expenses payable accrued liabilities and other non financial liabilities  are expenses that  have been recognized on a company s income statement but which have not yet been paid as of the balance  sheet date  In addition to income taxes payable other common examples of accrued expenses are accrued  interest payable accrued warranty costs and accrued employee compensation  i e  wages payable   SAP  Group s notes disclose that the       million line item of other non financial liabilities for example  includes       million of employee related liabilities

2,204,Deferred income  also called deferred revenue and unearned revenue  arises when a company
3,204,receives payment in advance of delivery of the goods and services associated with the payment  The  company has an obligation either to provide the goods or services or to return the cash received  Examples  include lease payments received at the beginning of a lease fees for servicing office equipment received at  the beginning of the service period and payments for magazine subscriptions received at the beginning of  the subscription period  SAP Group s balance sheet shows deferred income of      million at the end of       down slightly from      million at the end of       Apple Inc  s balance sheet shows deferred  revenue of       million at the end of fiscal      up    percent from       million at the end of fiscal        Example   presents each company s disclosures about deferred revenue and discusses some of the  implications 
4,204,EXAMPLE  
5,204,Analysis of Deferred Revenue
6,204,In the notes to its      financial statements SAP Group describes its deferred income as follows 
7,204,Deferred income consists mainly of prepayments made by our customers for support  services and professional services fees for multiple element arrangements allocated to  undelivered elements and amounts   for obligations to perform under acquired  support contracts in connection with acquisitions 
8,204,Apple s deferred revenue arises from sales involving components some delivered at the time of  sale and others to be delivered in the future  In its      financial statements Apple Inc  explains  that accounting for sale of some of its products is treated as two deliverables 
9,204, The first deliverable is the hardware and software delivered at the time of sale and  the second deliverable is the right included with the purchase of iPhone and Apple TV  to receive on a when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrades and  features relating to the product s software  the Company is required to estimate a  standalone selling price for the unspecified software upgrade right included with the  sale of iPhone and Apple TV and recognizes that amount ratably over the    month  estimated life of the related hardware device   
10,204,   In general in the period a transaction occurs how would a company s balance sheet reflect       of deferred revenue resulting from a sale   Assume for simplicity that the company  receives cash for all sales the company s income tax payable is    percent based on cash  receipts and the company pays cash for all relevant income tax obligations as they arise   Ignore any associated deferred costs  
11,204,   In general how does deferred revenue impact a company s financial statements in the periods  following its initial recognition 
12,204,   Interpret the amounts shown by SAP Group as deferred income and by Apple Inc  as deferred  revenue 
13,204,   Both accounts payable and deferred revenue are classified as current liabilities  Discuss the  following statements 
14,204,A  When assessing a company s liquidity the implication of amounts in accounts payable  differs from the implication of amounts in deferred revenue 
15,204,B  Some investors monitor amounts in deferred revenue as an indicator of future revenue  growth

2,205,Solution to   
3,205,In the period that deferred revenue arises the company would record a      increase in the asset  Cash and a      increase in the liability Deferred Revenues  In addition because the company s  income tax payable is based on cash receipts and is paid in the current period the company would  record a     decrease in the asset Cash and a     increase in the asset Deferred Tax Assets   Deferred tax assets increase because the company has paid taxes on revenue it has not yet  recognised for accounting purposes  In effect the company has prepaid taxes from an accounting  perspective 
4,205,Solution to   
5,205,In subsequent periods the company will recognize the deferred revenue as it is earned  When the  revenue is recognized the liability Deferred Revenue will decrease  In addition the tax expense is  recognized on the income statement as the revenue is recognised and thus the associated amounts of  Deferred Tax Assets will decrease 
6,205,Solution to   
7,205,The deferred income on SAP Group s balance sheet and deferred revenue on Apple Inc  s balance  sheet at the end of their respective      fiscal years will be recognized as revenue sales or a  similar item in income statements subsequent to the      fiscal year as the goods or services are  provided or the obligation is reduced  The costs of delivering the goods or services will also be  recognised 
8,205,Solution to  A 
9,205,The amount of accounts payable represents a future obligation to pay cash to suppliers  In contrast  the amount of deferred revenue represents payments that the company has already received from its  customers and the future obligation is to deliver the related services  With respect to liquidity  settling accounts payable will require cash outflows whereas settling deferred revenue obligations  will not 
10,205,Solution to  B 
11,205,Some investors monitor amounts in deferred revenue as an indicator of future growth because the  amounts in deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in the future  Thus growth in the  amount of deferred revenue implies future growth of that component of a company s revenue

4,207,     Property Plant and Equipment
5,207,Property plant and equipment  PPE  are tangible assets that are used in company operations and  expected to be used  provide economic benefits  over more than one fiscal period  Examples of tangible  assets treated as property plant and equipment include land buildings equipment machinery furniture  and natural resources such as mineral and petroleum resources  IFRS permits companies to report PPE  using either a cost model or a revaluation model   While IFRS permits companies to use the cost model for  some classes of assets and the revaluation model for others the company must apply the same model to all  assets within a particular class of assets  US GAAP permits only the cost model for reporting PPE 
6,207,Under the cost model PPE is carried at amortised cost  historical cost less any accumulated depreciation or  accumulated depletion and less any impairment losses   Historical cost generally consists of an asset s  purchase price its delivery cost and any other additional costs incurred to make the asset operable  such as  costs to install a machine   Depreciation and depletion is the process of allocating  recognizing as an  expense  the cost of a long lived asset over its useful life  Land is not depreciated  Because PPE is  presented on the balance sheet net of depreciation and depreciation expense is recognised in the income  statement the choice of depreciation method and the related estimates of useful life and salvage value  impact both a company s balance sheet and income statement 
7,207,Whereas depreciation is the systematic allocation of cost over an asset s useful life impairment losses  reflect an unanticipated decline in value  Impairment occurs when the asset s recoverable amount is less  than its carrying amount with terms defined as follows under IFRS   
8,207,  Recoverable amount  The higher of an asset s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use 
9,207,  Fair value less cost to sell  The amount obtainable in a sale of the asset in an arms length transaction  between knowledgeable willing parties less the costs of the sale 
10,207,  Value in use  The present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset 
11,207,When an asset is considered impaired the company recognizes the impairment loss in the income  statement  Reversals of impairment losses are permitted under IFRS but not under US GAAP 
12,207,Under the revaluation model the reported and carrying value for PPE is the fair value at the date of  revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation  Changes in the value of PPE under the  revaluation model affect equity directly or profit and loss depending upon the circumstances 
13,207,In Exhibits   and   SAP Group reports       million of PPE and Apple Inc  reports       million of  PPE at the end of fiscal year       For SAP Group PPE represents approximately    percent of total assets  and for Apple PPE represents approximately   percent of total assets  SAP Group discloses in its notes that  land is not depreciated that they use a cost model for PPE and that PPE are generally depreciated over  their expected useful lives using the straight line method  Apple Inc  discloses similar policies but does not  specifically disclose that land is not depreciated

2,208,     Investment Property
3,208,Some property is not used in the production of goods or services or for administrative purposes  Instead it  is used to earn rental income or capital appreciation  or both   Under IFRS such property is considered to  be investment property    US GAAP does not include a specific definition for investment property   IFRS provides companies with the choice to report investment property using either a cost model or a fair  value model  In general a company must apply its chosen model  cost or fair value  to all of its investment  property  The cost model for investment property is identical to the cost model for PPE  In other words  investment property is carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment  losses  Under the fair value model investment property is carried at its fair value  When a company uses  the fair value model to measure the value of its investment property any gain or loss arising from a change  in the fair value of the investment property is recognized in profit and loss i e  on the income statement in  the period in which it arises   
4,208,Neither SAP Group nor Apple disclose ownership of investment property  The types of companies that  typically hold investment property are real estate investment companies or property management  companies  Entities such as life insurance companies and endowment funds may also hold investment  properties as part of their investment portfolio 
5,208,     Intangible Assets
6,208,Intangible assets are identifiable non monetary assets without physical substance    An identifiable  asset can be acquired singly  can be separated from the entity  or is the result of specific contractual or  legal rights or privileges  Examples include patents licenses and trademarks  The most common asset that  is not a separately identifiable asset is accounting goodwill which arises in business combinations and is  discussed further in Section     
7,208,IFRS allows companies to report intangible assets using either a cost model or a revaluation model  The  revaluation model can only be selected when there is an active market for an intangible asset  These  measurement models are essentially the same as described for PPE  US GAAP permits only the cost  model 
8,208,For each intangible asset a company assesses whether the useful life of the asset is finite or indefinite   Amortisation and impairment principles apply as follows 
9,208,  An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate  of its useful life with the amortisation method and useful life estimate reviewed at least annually 
10,208,  Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE 
11,208,  An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised  Instead at least annually the  reasonableness of assuming an indefinite useful life for the asset is reviewed and the asset is tested  for impairment 
12,208,Financial analysts have traditionally viewed the values assigned to intangible assets particularly goodwill  with caution  Consequently in assessing financial statements analysts often exclude the book value  assigned to intangibles reducing net equity by an equal amount and increasing pretax income by any  amortisation expense or impairment associated with the intangibles  An arbitrary assignment of zero value  to intangibles is not advisable  instead an analyst should examine each listed intangible and assess whether  an adjustment should be made  Note disclosures about intangible assets may provide useful information to  the analyst  These disclosures include information about useful lives amortisation rates and methods and  impairment losses recognised or reversed

2,209,Further a company may have developed intangible assets internally that can only be recognised in certain  circumstances  Companies may also have assets that are never recorded on a balance sheet because they  have no physical substance and are non identifiable  These assets might include management skill name  recognition a good reputation and so forth  Such assets are valuable and are in theory reflected in the  price at which the company s equity securities trade in the market  and the price at which the entirety of the  company s equity would be sold in an acquisition transaction   Such assets may be recognised as goodwill  if a company is acquired but are not recognised until an acquisition occurs 
3,209,       Identifiable Intangibles
4,209,Under IFRS identifiable intangible assets are recognised on the balance sheet if it is probable that future  economic benefits will flow to the company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably  Examples  of identifiable intangible assets include patents trademarks copyrights franchises licenses and other  rights  Identifiable intangible assets may have been created internally or purchased by a company   Determining the cost of internally created intangible assets can be difficult and subjective  For these  reasons under IFRS and US GAAP the general requirement is that internally created identifiable  intangibles are expensed rather than reported on the balance sheet 
5,209,IFRS provides that for internally created intangible assets the company must separately identify the  research phase and the development phase    The research phase includes activities that seek new  knowledge or products  The development phase occurs after the research phase and includes design or  testing of prototypes and models  IFRS require that costs to internally generate intangible assets during the  research phase must be expensed on the income statement  Costs incurred in the development stage can be  capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met including technological feasibility the ability to  use or sell the resulting asset and the ability to complete the project 
6,209,US GAAP prohibits the capitalization as an asset of most costs of internally developed intangibles and  research and development  All such costs usually must be expensed  Costs related to the following  categories are typically expensed under IFRS and US GAAP  They include 
7,209,  internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists etc  
8,209,  start up costs 
9,209,  training costs 
10,209,  administrative and other general overhead costs 
11,209,  advertising and promotion 
12,209,  relocation and reorganization expenses  and
13,209,  redundancy and other termination costs 
14,209,Generally acquired intangible assets are reported as separately identifiable intangibles  as opposed to  goodwill  if they arise from contractual rights  such as a licensing agreement  other legal rights  such as  patents  or have the ability to be separated and sold  such as a customer list

2,211,     Goodwill
3,211,When one company acquires another the purchase price is allocated to all the identifiable assets  tangible  and intangible  and liabilities acquired based on fair value  If the purchase price is greater than the  acquirer s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired the excess is described  as goodwill and is recognized as an asset  To understand why an acquirer would pay more to purchase a  company than the fair value of the target company s identifiable assets and liabilities consider the  following three observations  First as noted certain items not recognized in a company s own financial  statements  e g  its reputation established distribution system trained employees  have value  Second a  target company s expenditures in research and development may not have resulted in a separately  identifiable asset that meets the criteria for recognition but nonetheless may have created some value   Third part of the value of an acquisition may arise from strategic positioning versus a competitor or from  perceived synergies  The purchase price might not pertain solely to the separately identifiable assets and  liabilities acquired and thus may exceed the value of those net assets due to the acquisition s role in  protecting the value of all of the acquirer s existing assets or to cost savings and benefits from combining  the companies 
4,211,The subject of recognizing goodwill in financial statements has found both proponents and opponents  among professionals  The proponents of goodwill recognition assert that goodwill is the present value of  excess returns that a company is able to earn  This group claims that determining the present value of these  excess returns is analogous to determining the present value of future cash flows associated with other  assets and projects  Opponents of goodwill recognition claim that the prices paid for acquisitions often turn  out to be based on unrealistic expectations thereby leading to future write offs of goodwill 
5,211,Analysts should distinguish between accounting goodwill and economic goodwill  Economic goodwill is  based on the economic performance of the entity whereas accounting goodwill is based on accounting  standards and is reported only in the case of acquisitions  Economic goodwill is important to analysts and  investors and it is not necessarily reflected on the balance sheet  Instead economic goodwill is reflected in  the stock price  at least in theory   Some financial statement users believe that goodwill should not be listed  on the balance sheet because it cannot be sold separately from the entity  These financial statement users  believe that only assets that can be separately identified and sold should be reflected on the balance sheet   Other financial statement users analyze goodwill and any subsequent impairment charges to assess  management s performance on prior acquisitions 
6,211,Under both IFRS and US GAAP accounting goodwill arising from acquisitions is capitalized  Goodwill is  not amortised but is tested for impairment annually  If goodwill is deemed to be impaired an impairment  loss is charged against income in the current period  An impairment loss reduces current earnings  An  impairment loss also reduces total assets so some performance measures such as return on assets  net  income divided by average total assets  may actually increase in future periods  An impairment loss is a  non cash item 
7,211,Accounting standards  requirements for recognizing goodwill can be summarized by the following steps 
8,211,A  The total cost to purchase the target company  the acquiree  is determined 
9,211,B  The acquiree s identifiable assets are measured at fair value  The acquiree s liabilities and contingent  liabilities are measured at fair value  The difference between the fair value of identifiable assets and  the fair value of the liabilities and contingent liabilities equals the net identifiable assets acquired 
10,211,C  Goodwill arising from the purchase is the excess of a  the cost to purchase the target company and b   the net identifiable assets acquired  Occasionally a transaction will involve the purchase of net  identifiable assets with a value greater than the cost to purchase  Such a transaction is called a   bargain purchase   Any gain from a bargain purchase is recognized in profit and loss in the period  in which it arises

2,212,Companies are also required to disclose information that enables users to evaluate the nature and financial  effect of business combinations  The required disclosures include for example the acquisition date fair  value of the total cost to purchase the target company the acquisition date amount recognized for each  major class of assets and liabilities and a qualitative description of the factors that make up the goodwill  recognized 
3,212,Despite the guidance incorporated in accounting standards analysts should be aware that the estimations of  fair value involve considerable management judgment  Values for intangible assets such as computer  software might not be easily validated when analyzing acquisitions  Management judgment about  valuation in turn impacts current and future financial statements because identifiable intangible assets with  definite lives are amortised over time  In contrast neither goodwill nor identifiable intangible assets with  indefinite lives are amortised  instead both are tested annually for impairment 
4,212,The recognition and impairment of goodwill can significantly affect the comparability of financial  statements between companies  Therefore analysts often adjust the companies  financial statements by  removing the impact of goodwill  Such adjustments include 
5,212,  excluding goodwill from balance sheet data used to compute financial ratios and
6,212,  excluding goodwill impairment losses from income data used to examine operating trends 
7,212,In addition analysts can develop expectations about a company s performance following an acquisition by  taking into account the purchase price paid relative to the net assets and earnings prospects of the acquired  company 
8,212,EXAMPLE  
9,212,Goodwill Impairment
10,212,Safeway Inc  is a North American food and drug retailer  On    February      Safeway issued a  press release that included the following information 
11,212,Safeway Inc  today reported a net loss of         million        per diluted share  for  the    week fourth quarter of       Excluding a non cash goodwill impairment charge  of         million net of tax        per diluted share  net income would have been         million        per diluted share   Net income was        million        per  diluted share  for the    week fourth quarter of      
12,212,In the fourth quarter of      Safeway recorded a non cash goodwill impairment  charge of         million          million net of tax   The impairment was due  primarily to Safeway s reduced market capitalization and a weak economy  The  goodwill originated from previous acquisitions 
13,212,Safeway s balance sheet as of   January      showed goodwill of        million and  total assets of          million  The company s balance sheet as of   January       showed goodwill of         million and total assets of          million 
14,212,   How significant is this goodwill impairment charge 
15,212,   With reference to acquisition prices what might this goodwill impairment indicate 
16,212,Solution to   
17,212,The goodwill impairment was more than    percent of the total value of goodwill and    percent of  total assets so it was clearly significant   The charge of         million equals      percent of the          million of goodwill at the beginning of the year and      percent of the          million  total assets at the beginning of the year

2,213,Solution to   
3,213,The goodwill had originated from previous acquisitions  The impairment charge implies that the  acquired operations are now worth less than the price that was paid for their acquisition 
4,213,As presented in Exhibits   and   SAP Group s      balance sheet shows       million of goodwill and  Apple s      balance sheet shows goodwill of      million  Goodwill represents      percent of SAP  Group s total assets and only     percent of Apple s total assets  An analyst may be concerned that  goodwill represents such a high proportion of SAP Group s total assets 
5,213,     Financial Assets
6,213,IFRS define a financial instrument as a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a  financial liability or equity instrument of another entity    This section will focus on financial assets such  as a company s investments in stocks issued by another company or its investments in the notes bonds or  other fixed income instruments issued by another company  or issued by a governmental entity   Financial  liabilities such as notes payable and bonds payable issued by the company itself will be discussed in the  liability portion of this reading  Some financial instruments may be classified as either an asset or a liability  depending on the contractual terms and current market conditions  One example of such a financial  instrument is a derivative  Derivatives are financial instruments for which the value is derived based on  some underlying factor  interest rate exchange rate commodity price security price or credit rating  and  for which little or no initial investment is required 
7,213,All financial instruments are recognized when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  the instrument  In general there are two basic alternative ways that financial instruments are measured  fair  value or amortised cost  Recall that fair value is the arm s length transaction price at which an asset could  be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable and willing parties under IFRS and the price  that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability under US GAAP  The amortised cost of  a financial asset  or liability  is the amount at which it was initially recognized minus any principal  repayments plus or minus any amortisation of discount or premium and minus any reduction for  impairment 
8,213,Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the asset s cash flows occur on specified dates and  consist solely of principal and interest and if the business model is to hold the asset to maturity  This  category of asset is referred to as held to maturity  An example is an investment in a long term bond  issued by another company  the value of the bond will fluctuate for example with interest rate movements  but if the bond is classified as held to maturity it will be measured at amortised cost  Other types of  financial assets measured at historical cost are loans  to other companies  
9,213,Financial assets not measured at amortised cost are measured at fair value  For financial instruments  measured at fair value there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized  as  profit or loss on the income statement or as other comprehensive income  loss  which bypasses the income  statement  Note that these alternatives refer to unrealized changes in fair value i e  changes in the value of  a financial asset that has not been sold and is still owned at the end of the period  Unrealized gains and  losses are also referred to as holding period gains and losses  If a financial asset is sold within the period a  gain is realized if the selling price is greater than the carrying value and a loss is realized if the selling price  is less than the carrying value  When a financial asset is sold any realized gain or loss is reported on the  income statement  The category held for trading  or  trading securities  under US GAAP  refers to a  category of financial assets that is acquired primarily for the purpose of selling in the near term  These  assets are likely to be held only for a short period of time  These trading assets are measured at fair value  and any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized as profit or loss on the income statement  Mark  to market refers to the process whereby the value of a financial instrument is adjusted to reflect current  fair value based on market prices

2,214,Some financial assets are not classified as held for trading even though they are available to be sold  Such  available for sale assets are measured at fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses  recognized in other comprehensive income  The  available for sale  classification is no longer in effect  under IFRS with the release of IFRS    Financial Instruments   IFRS   is based on the concept that  financial assets should be classified and measured at either amortised cost or at fair value and subsequently  recognised in either the income statement or other comprehensive income when they arise  Although the  available for sale category no longer exists IFRS still permit certain equity investments to be measured at  fair value with any unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income   Specifically at the time a company buys an equity investment that is not held for trading the company is  permitted to make an irrevocable election to measure the asset in this manner  These assets are referred to  as  financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income    
3,214,IFRS   adopts a new approach for the impairment of financial assets that are measured at amortised cost   e g  loans and receivables including trade receivables   IFRS requires an  expected loss  impairment  method in which the recognition of losses is based on the risk that a loan will default rather than on  whether a loss has been incurred  as was the case under IFRS     
4,214,Exhibit    summarizes how various financial assets are classified and measured 
5,214,Exhibit     Measurement of Financial Assets

13,214, As described above the available for sale category is no longer be a choice under IFRS upon the   January       effective date of IFRS   
14,214,To illustrate the different accounting treatments of the gains and losses on financial assets consider an  entity that invests            on   January    X in a fixed income security investment with a   percent  coupon paid semi annually  After six months the company receives the first coupon payment of            Additionally market interest rates have declined such that the value of the fixed income  investment has increased by          as of    June    X  Exhibit    illustrates how this situation will  be portrayed in the balance sheet assets and equity as well as the income statement  ignoring taxes  of the  entity concerned under each of the following three accounting policies for financial assets  assets held for  trading purposes assets available for sale and held to maturity assets

15,217,     Long term Financial Liabilities
16,217,Typical long term financial liabilities include loans  i e  borrowings from banks  and notes or bonds  payable  i e  fixed income securities issued to investors   Liabilities such as loans payable and bonds  payable are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet  At maturity the amortised cost of the  bond  carrying amount  will be equal to the face value of the bond  For example if a company issues            of bonds at par the bonds are reported as a long term liability of     million  The carrying  amount  amortised cost  from issue to maturity remains at     million  As another example if a company  issues           of bonds at a price of        a discount to par  the bonds are reported as a liability of            Over the bond s life the discount of         is amortised so that the bond will be listed as a  liability of           at maturity  Similarly any bond premium would be amortised for bonds issued at a  price in excess of face or par value 
17,217,In certain cases liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are reported at fair value  Those cases  include financial liabilities held for trading derivatives that are a liability to the company and some non  derivative instruments such as those which are hedged by derivatives

2,218,     Deferred Tax Liabilities
3,218,Deferred tax liabilities result from temporary timing differences between a company s income as  reported for tax purposes  taxable income  and income as reported for financial statement purposes   reported income   Deferred tax liabilities result when taxable income and the actual income tax payable in  a period based on it is less than the reported financial statement income before taxes and the income tax  expense based on it  Deferred tax liabilities are defined as the amounts of income taxes payable in future  periods in respect of taxable temporary differences    In the previous discussion of unearned revenue  inclusion of revenue in taxable income in an earlier period created a deferred tax asset  essentially prepaid  tax  
4,218,Deferred tax liabilities typically arise when items of expense are included in taxable income in earlier  periods than for financial statement net income  This results in taxable income being less than income  before taxes in the earlier periods  As a result taxes payable based on taxable income are less than income  tax expense based on accounting income before taxes  The difference between taxes payable and income  tax expense results in a deferred tax liability for example when companies use accelerated depreciation  methods for tax purposes and straight line depreciation methods for financial statement purposes  Deferred  tax liabilities also arise when items of income are included in taxable income in later periods for  example when a company s subsidiary has profits that have not yet been distributed and thus have not yet  been taxed 
5,218,SAP Group s balance sheet in Exhibit    shows      million of deferred tax liabilities  Apple s balance  sheet in Exhibit    does not show a separate line item for deferred tax liabilities however note disclosures  indicate that the       million of non current liabilities reported on Apple s balance sheet includes  deferred tax liabilities of       million 
6,218,   EQUITY
7,218,Equity is the owners  residual claim on a company s assets after subtracting its liabilities    It represents  the claim of the owner against the company  Equity includes funds directly invested in the company by the  owners as well as earnings that have been reinvested over time  Equity can also include items of gain or  loss that are not yet recognized on the company s income statement 
8,218,     Components of Equity
9,218,Six potential components comprise total owners  equity  The first five components listed below comprise  equity attributable to owners of parent  The sixth component is the equity attributable to non controlling  interests 
10,218,   Capital contributed by owners  or common stock or issued capital   The amount contributed to the  company by owners  Ownership of a corporation is evidenced through the issuance of common  shares  Common shares may have a par value  or stated value  or may be issued as no par shares   depending on regulations governing the incorporation   Where par or stated value requirements  exist it must be disclosed in the equity section of the balance sheet  In addition the number of shares  authorized issued and outstanding must be disclosed for each class of share issued by the company   The number of authorized shares is the number of shares that may be sold by the company under its  articles of incorporation  The number of issued shares refers to those shares that have been sold to  investors  The number of outstanding shares consists of the issued shares less treasury shares

2,219,   Preferred shares  Classified as equity or financial liabilities based upon their characteristics rather  than legal form  For example perpetual non redeemable preferred shares are classified as equity  In  contrast preferred shares with mandatory redemption at a fixed amount at a future date are classified  as financial liabilities  Preferred shares have rights that take precedence over the rights of common  shareholders rights that generally pertain to receipt of dividends and receipt of assets if the  company is liquidated 
3,219,   Treasury shares  or treasury stock or own shares repurchased   Shares in the company that have been  repurchased by the company and are held as treasury shares rather than being cancelled  The  company is able to sell  reissue  these shares  A company may repurchase its shares when  management considers the shares undervalued needs shares to fulfill employees  stock options or  wants to limit the effects of dilution from various employee stock compensation plans  A purchase of  treasury shares reduces shareholders  equity by the amount of the acquisition cost and reduces the  number of total shares outstanding  If treasury shares are subsequently reissued a company does not  recognize any gain or loss from the reissuance on the income statement  Treasury shares are non  voting and do not receive any dividends declared by the company 
4,219,   Retained earnings  The cumulative amount of earnings recognized in the company s income  statements which have not been paid to the owners of the company as dividends 
5,219,   Accumulated other comprehensive income  or other reserves   The cumulative amount of other comprehensive income or loss  Comprehensive income includes both a  net income which is  recognized on the income statement and is reflected in retained earnings and b  other comprehensive  income which is not recognized as part of net income and is reflected in accumulated other  comprehensive income   
6,219,   Noncontrolling interest  or minority interest   The equity interests of minority shareholders in the  subsidiary companies that have been consolidated by the parent  controlling  company but that are  not wholly owned by the parent company 
7,219,Exhibits    and    present excerpts of the balance sheets of SAP Group and Apple Inc  respectively with  detailed line items for each company s equity section  SAP s balance sheet indicates that the company has       million shares of no par common stock outstanding with a corresponding amount shown in issued  capital of       million  Presentation of the amount of treasury shares        million is explained in  the company s notes 
8,219,Treasury shares are recorded at acquisition cost and are presented as a deduction from total  equity  Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of treasury shares are credited or  charged to share premium on an after tax basis 
9,219,Source  SAP Group      annual report
10,219,Thus the line item share premium of      million includes amounts from treasury share transactions  and  certain other transactions   The amount of retained earnings       million represents the cumulative  amount of earnings that the company has recognized in its income statements net of dividends  SAP  Group s       million of  Other components of equity  includes the company s accumulated other  comprehensive income  The consolidated statement of changes in equity shows that this is composed of       million of losses on exchange differences in translation     million gains on remeasuring available  for sale financial assets and     million losses on cash flow hedges  The balance sheet presents a subtotal  for the amount of equity attributable to the parent company       million followed by the amount of  equity attributable to non controlling interests  Total equity includes both equity attributable to the parent  company and equity attributable to non controlling interests 
11,219,The equity section of Apple s balance sheet consists of only three line items  common stock retained  earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income  loss   The company holds no treasury stock and  has no minority interests

30,222,   ANALYSIS OF THE BALANCE SHEET
31,222,This section describes two tools for analyzing the balance sheet  common size analysis and balance sheet  ratios  Analysis of a company s balance sheet can provide insight into the company s liquidity and  solvency as of the balance sheet date as well as the economic resources the company controls   Liquidity refers to a company s ability to meet its short term financial commitments  Assessments of  liquidity focus a company s ability to convert assets to cash and to pay for operating needs  Solvency refers to a company s ability to meet its financial obligations over the longer term  Assessments of  solvency focus on the company s financial structure and its ability to pay long term financing obligations

2,223,The first technique vertical common size analysis involves stating each balance sheet item as a percentage  of total assets    Common size statements are useful in comparing a company s balance sheet composition  over time  time series analysis  and across companies in the same industry  To illustrate Panel A of  Exhibit    presents a balance sheet for three hypothetical companies  Company C with assets of        million is much larger than Company A and Company B each with only       million in assets  The  common size balance sheet presented in Panel B facilitates a comparison of these different sized  companies

9,224,Most of the assets of Company A and B are current assets  however Company A has nearly    percent of  its total assets in cash and short term marketable securities while Company B has only   percent of its  assets in cash  Company A is more liquid than Company B  Company A shows no current liabilities  its  current liabilities round to less than     thousand  and it has cash on hand of      million to meet any  near term financial obligations it might have  In contrast Company B has      million of current liabilities  which exceed its available cash of only      thousand  To pay those near term obligations Company B  will need to collect some of its accounts receivables sell more inventory borrow from a bank and or raise  more long term capital  e g  by issuing more bonds or more equity   Company C also appears more liquid  than Company B  It holds over    percent of its total assets in cash and short term marketable securities  and its current liabilities are only     percent of the amount of total assets 
10,224,Company C s      million in cash and short term marketable securities is substantially more than its  current liabilities of      thousand  Turning to the question of solvency however note that      percent of  Company C s assets are financed with liabilities  If Company C experiences significant fluctuations in cash  flows it may be unable to pay the interest and principal on its long term bonds  Company A is far more  solvent than Company C with less than one percent of its assets financed with liabilities 
11,224,Note that these examples are hypothetical only  Other than general comparisons little more can be said  without further detail  In practice a wide range of factors affect a company s liquidity management and  capital structure  The study of optimal capital structure is a fundamental issue addressed in corporate  finance  Capital refers to a company s long term debt and equity financing  capital structure refers to the  proportion of debt versus equity financing 
12,224,Common size balance sheets can also highlight differences in companies  strategies  Comparing the asset  composition of the companies Company C has made a greater proportional investment in property plant  and equipment possibly because it manufactures more of its products in house  The presence of goodwill  on Company B s balance sheet signifies that it has made one or more acquisitions in the past  In contrast  the lack of goodwill on the balance sheets of Company A and Company C suggests that these two  companies may have pursued a strategy of internal growth rather than growth by acquisition  Company A  may be in either a start up or liquidation stage of operations as evidenced by the composition of its balance  sheet  It has relatively little inventory and no accounts payable  It either has not yet established trade credit  or it is in the process of paying off its obligations in the process of liquidating

2,225,Common Size Analysis
3,225,Applying common size analysis to the excerpts of SAP Group s balance sheets presented in  Exhibits       and    answer the following  In      relative to      which two of the following  line items increased as a percentage of assets 
4,225,A  Cash and cash equivalents 
5,225,B  Other financial assets 
6,225,C  Trade and other receivables 
7,225,D  Tax assets 
8,225,E  Bank loans classified as current  i e  due within one year  
9,225,F  Bank loans classified as non current  i e  due after one year  
10,225,Solution 
11,225,   amounts shown are in millions   A and F are correct  Both cash and longer term bank loans  increased as a percentage of total assets  Cash and cash equivalents increased from     percent of  total assets in                       to      percent in                        Bank loans due  after one year increased from      percent in                    to     percent in                        The company may have borrowed funds for a strategic purpose that it has not yet acted  upon 
12,225,The other items  other financial assets trade and other receivables tax assets and bank loans  classified as current  all decreased both in absolute Euro amounts and as a percentage of total assets  when compared with the previous year  Note that some amounts of the company s other financial  assets trade and other receivables and tax assets are classified as current assets  shown in Exhibit     and some amounts are classified as non current assets  shown in Exhibit     The total  amounts current and non current of other financial assets trade and other receivables and tax  assets therefore are obtained by summing the amounts in Exhibits   and   
13,225,Overall the company strengthened its liquidity position in       Total current assets were  approximately the same percentage of total assets whereas cash was a much higher percentage of  total assets  total current liabilities were a much smaller percentage of the amount of total assets 
14,225,Common size analysis of the balance sheet is particularly useful in cross sectional analysis comparing  companies to each other for a particular time period or comparing a company with industry or sector data   The analyst could select individual peer companies for comparison use industry data from published  sources or compile data from databases  When analyzing a company many analysts prefer to select the  peer companies for comparison or to compile their own industry statistics

10,228,APPLE   Apple Inc   DELL   Dell Inc   HPQ   Hewlett Packard Co  Source  Based on data from companies  annual reports 
11,228,From this data Lu learns the following 
12,228,  Apple and Dell have a high level of cash and short term marketable securities consistent  with the information technology sector as reported in Exhibit     Hewlett Packard s  percentage of cash and marketable securities is lower perhaps reflecting its broader range of  information technology products and services  Apple has a higher balance in cash and  investments combined than Dell Hewlett Packard or the industry sector as reported in  Exhibit     This may reflect the success of the company s business model which has  generated large operating cash flows in recent years 
13,228,  Apple has the lowest level of accounts receivable  Further research is necessary to learn the  extent to which this is related to Apple s cash sales through its own retail stores  An  alternative explanation would be that the company has been selling factoring receivables to a  greater degree than the other companies  however that explanation is unlikely given Apple s  cash position 
14,228,  Apple and Dell both have low levels of inventory compared to the industry sector as reported  in Exhibit     Both utilize a just in time inventory system and rely on suppliers to hold  inventory until needed  Additional scrutiny of the notes accompanying their annual reports  reveals Apple regularly makes purchase commitments that are not currently recorded as  inventory and uses contract manufacturers to assemble and test some finished products  All  of the companies have some purchase commitments and make some use of contract  manufacturers which implies that inventory may be  understated  
15,228,  Apple and Dell have a level of property plant and equipment below that of the sector  whereas Hewlett Packard is very close to the sector median as reported in Exhibit    
16,228,  Hewlett Packard has a large amount of goodwill from its steady stream of acquisitions over  the last decade

2,229,  Dell has a large amount of accounts payable  Because of Dell s high level of cash and  investments this is likely not a problem for Dell 
3,229,  Consistent with the industry Dell and Hewlett Packard have very low levels of long term  debt  Apple has no long term debt 
4,229,     Balance Sheet Ratios
5,229,Ratios facilitate time series and cross sectional analysis of a company s financial position  Balance sheet  ratios are those involving balance sheet items only  Each of the line items on a vertical common size  balance sheet is a ratio in that it expresses a balance sheet amount in relation to total assets  Other balance  sheet ratios compare one balance sheet item to another  For example the current ratio expresses current  assets in relation to current liabilities as an indicator of a company s liquidity  Balance sheet ratios include  liquidity ratios  measuring the company s ability to meet its short term obligations  and solvency ratios  measuring the company s ability to meet long term and other obligations   These ratios and others are  discussed in a later reading  Exhibit    summarizes the calculation and interpretation of selected balance  sheet ratios

2,231,  The increase in each of the liquidity ratios  current quick and cash  in      indicates that  the company s liquidity position strengthened  Compared with the end of      the company  reported a greater amount of current assets relative to current liabilities 
3,231,  The long term debt to equity ratio indicates the amount of long term debt capital relative to  the amount of equity capital  In general an increase in the long term debt to equity ratio  implies that a company s solvency has weakened  In this case however several points should  be noted  First despite the increase this company s ratio remains very low indicating its  solvency position is strong  Second securing long term financing in      when credit  market disruptions had caused difficulty for some companies seeking to borrow could be  considered a very prudent action  Third the company s overall financial leverage decreased  i e  improved 
4,231,  The debt to equity ratio indicates the amount of total debt capital relative to the amount of  equity capital  Financial leverage indicates the amount of total asset relative to equity  A  decrease in the debt to equity and financial leverage ratios implies that a company s total  leverage decreased and thus its solvency has improved  In this case the company s total  leverage decreased largely because the company repaid most of its short term bank loans and  increased its equity in      
5,231,Cross sectional financial ratio analysis can be limited by differences in accounting methods  In addition  lack of homogeneity of a company s operating activities can limit comparability  For diversified companies  operating in different industries using industry specific ratios for different lines of business can provide  better comparisons  Companies disclose information on operating segments  The financial position and  performance of the operating segments can be compared to the relevant industry 
6,231,Ratio analysis requires a significant amount of judgment  One key area requiring judgment is  understanding the limitations of any ratio  The current ratio for example is only a rough measure of  liquidity at a specific point in time  The ratio captures only the amount of current assets but the  components of current assets differ significantly in their nearness to cash  e g  marketable securities versus  inventory   Another limitation of the current ratio is its sensitivity to end of period financing and operating  decisions that can potentially impact current asset and current liability amounts  Another overall area  requiring judgment is determining whether a ratio for a company is within a reasonable range for an  industry  Yet another area requiring judgment is evaluating whether a ratio signifies a persistent condition  or reflects only a temporary condition  Overall evaluating specific ratios requires an examination of the  entire operations of a company its competitors and the external economic and industry setting in which it  is operating

8,231,The balance sheet  also referred to as the statement of financial position  discloses what an entity owns   assets  and what it owes  liabilities  at a specific point in time  Equity is the owners  residual interest in  the assets of a company net of its liabilities  The amount of equity is increased by income earned during  the year or by the issuance of new equity  The amount of equity is decreased by losses by dividend  payments or by share repurchases 
9,231,An understanding of the balance sheet enables an analyst to evaluate the liquidity solvency and overall  financial position of a company 
10,231,  The balance sheet distinguishes between current and non current assets and between current and  non current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant and reliable  information

2,232,  The concept of liquidity relates to a company s ability to pay for its near term operating needs  With  respect to a company overall liquidity refers to the availability of cash to pay those near term needs   With respect to a particular asset or liability liquidity refers to its  nearness to cash  
3,232,  Some assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of fair value and some are measured at  historical cost  Notes to financial statements provide information that is helpful in assessing the  comparability of measurement bases across companies 
4,232,  Assets expected to be liquidated or used up within one year or one operating cycle of the business  whichever is greater are classified as current assets  Assets not expected to be liquidated or used up  within one year or one operating cycle of the business whichever is greater are classified as non  current assets 
5,232,  Liabilities expected to be settled or paid within one year or one operating cycle of the business  whichever is greater are classified as current liabilities  Liabilities not expected to be settled or paid  within one year or one operating cycle of the business whichever is greater are classified as non  current liabilities 
6,232,  Trade receivables also referred to as accounts receivable are amounts owed to a company by its  customers for products and services already delivered  Receivables are reported net of the allowance  for doubtful accounts 
7,232,  Inventories are physical products that will eventually be sold to the company s customers either in  their current form  finished goods  or as inputs into a process to manufacture a final product  raw  materials and work in process   Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value   If the net realizable value of a company s inventory falls below its carrying amount the company  must write down the value of the inventory and record an expense 
8,232,  Inventory cost is based on specific identification or estimated using the first in first out or weighted  average cost methods  Some accounting standards  including US GAAP but not IFRS  also allow  last in first out as an additional inventory valuation method 
9,232,  Accounts payable also called trade payables are amounts that a business owes its vendors for  purchases of goods and services 
10,232,  Deferred revenue  also known as unearned revenue  arises when a company receives payment in  advance of delivery of the goods and services associated with the payment received 
11,232,  Property plant and equipment  PPE  are tangible assets that are used in company operations and  expected to be used over more than one fiscal period  Examples of tangible assets include land  buildings equipment machinery furniture and natural resources such as mineral and petroleum  resources 
12,232,  IFRS provide companies with the choice to report PPE using either a historical cost model or a  revaluation model  US GAAP permit only the historical cost model for reporting PPE 
13,232,  Depreciation is the process of recognizing the cost of a long lived asset over its useful life   Land is  not depreciated  
14,232,  Under IFRS property used to earn rental income or capital appreciation is considered to be  investment property  IFRS provide companies with the choice to report investment property using  either a historical cost model or a fair value model 
15,232,  Intangible assets refer to identifiable non monetary assets without physical substance  Examples  include patents licenses and trademarks  For each intangible asset a company assesses whether the  useful life is finite or indefinite

2,233,  An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate  of its useful life with the amortisation method and useful life estimate reviewed at least annually   Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE 
3,233,  An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised  Instead it is tested for impairment  at least annually 
4,233,  For internally generated intangible assets IFRS require that costs incurred during the research phase  must be expensed  Costs incurred in the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if  certain criteria are met including technological feasibility the ability to use or sell the resulting  asset and the ability to complete the project 
5,233,  The most common asset that is not a separately identifiable asset is goodwill which arises in  business combinations  Goodwill is not amortised  instead it is tested for impairment at least  annually 
6,233,  Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity  In general there are two basic alternative ways that  financial instruments are measured  fair value or amortised cost  For financial instruments measured  at fair value there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized  as  profit or loss on the income statement or as other comprehensive income  loss  which bypasses the  income statement 
7,233,  Typical long term financial liabilities include loans  i e  borrowings from banks  and notes or bonds  payable  i e  fixed income securities issued to investors   Liabilities such as bonds issued by a  company are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet 
8,233,  Deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary timing differences between a company s income as  reported for tax purposes and income as reported for financial statement purposes 
9,233,  Six potential components that comprise the owners  equity section of the balance sheet include   contributed capital preferred shares treasury shares retained earnings accumulated other  comprehensive income and non controlling interest 
10,233,  The statement of changes in equity reflects information about the increases or decreases in each  component of a company s equity over a period 
11,233,  Vertical common size analysis of the balance sheet involves stating each balance sheet item as a  percentage of total assets 
12,233,  Balance sheet ratios include liquidity ratios  measuring the company s ability to meet its short term  obligations  and solvency ratios  measuring the company s ability to meet long term and other  obligations

14,239,   B is correct  Assets are resources controlled by a company as a result of past events 
15,239,   A is correct  Assets   Liabilities   Equity and therefore Assets   Liabilities   Equity 
16,239,   A is correct  A classified balance sheet is one that classifies assets and liabilities as current or non  current and provides a subtotal for current assets and current liabilities  A liquidity based balance  sheet broadly presents assets and liabilities in order of liquidity 
17,239,   B is correct  The balance sheet omits important aspects of a company s ability to generate future cash  flows such as its reputation and management skills  The balance sheet measures some assets and  liabilities based on historical cost and measures others based on current value  Market value of  shareholders  equity is updated continuously  Shareholders  equity reported on the balance sheet is  updated for reporting purposes and represents the value that was current at the end of the reporting  period 
18,239,   B is correct  Balance sheet information is as of a specific point in time and items measured at  current value reflect the value that was current at the end of the reporting period  For all financial  statement items an item should be recognized in the financial statements only if it is probable that  any future economic benefit associated with the item will flow to or from the entity and if the item  has a cost or value that can be measured with reliability 
19,239,   B is correct  Payments due within one operating cycle of the business even if they will be settled  more than one year after the balance sheet date are classified as current liabilities  Payment received  in advance of the delivery of a good or service creates an obligation or liability  If the obligation is to  be fulfilled at least one year after the balance sheet date it is recorded as a non current liability such  as deferred revenue or deferred income  Payments that the company has the unconditional right to  defer for at least one year after the balance sheet may be classified as non current liabilities 
20,239,   A is correct  A liquidity based presentation rather than a current non current presentation may be  used by such entities as banks if broadly presenting assets and liabilities in order of liquidity is  reliable and more relevant

2,240,   B is correct  Goodwill is a long term asset and the others are all current assets 
3,240,   C is correct  Both the cost of inventory and property plant and equipment include delivery costs or  costs incurred in bringing them to the location for use or resale 
4,240,    A is correct  Current liabilities are those liabilities including debt due within one year  Preferred  refers to a class of stock  Convertible refers to a feature of bonds  or preferred stock  allowing the  holder to convert the instrument into common stock 
5,240,    B is correct  The cash received from customers represents an asset  The obligation to provide a  product in the future is a liability called  unearned income  or  unearned revenue   As the product is  delivered revenue will be recognized and the liability will be reduced 
6,240,    C is correct  A contra asset account is netted against  i e  reduces  the balance of an asset account   The allowance for doubtful accounts reduces the balance of accounts receivable  Accumulated  depreciation not depreciation expense is a contra asset account  Sales returns and allowances create  a contra account that reduce sales not an asset 
7,240,    C is correct  Under IFRS inventories are carried at historical cost unless net realizable value of the  inventory is less  Under US GAAP inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
8,240,    C is correct  Paying rent in advance will reduce cash and increase prepaid expenses both of which  are assets 
9,240,    C is correct  Accrued liabilities are expenses that have been reported on a company s income  statement but have not yet been paid 
10,240,    A is correct  Initially goodwill is measured as the difference between the purchase price paid for an  acquisition and the fair value of the acquired not acquiring company s net assets  identifiable assets  less liabilities  
11,240,    C is correct  Impairment write downs reduce equity in the denominator of the debt to equity ratio but  do not affect debt so the debt to equity ratio is expected to increase  Impairment write downs reduce  total assets but do not affect revenue  Thus total asset turnover is expected to increase 
12,240,    B is correct  Vertical common size analysis involves stating each balance sheet item as a percentage  of total assets  Total assets are the sum of total liabilities      million  and total stockholders  equity       million  or     million  Total liabilities are shown on a vertical common size balance sheet as       million     million        
13,240,    B is correct  For financial assets classified as trading securities unrealized gains and losses are  reported on the income statement and flow to shareholders  equity as part of retained earnings 
14,240,    C is correct  For financial assets classified as available for sale unrealized gains and losses are not  recorded on the income statement and instead are part of other comprehensive income  Accumulated  other comprehensive income is a component of Shareholders  equity
15,240,    A is correct  Financial assets classified as held to maturity are measured at amortised cost  Gains and  losses are recognized only when realized 
16,240,    B is correct  The non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries is shown separately as part of  shareholders  equity 
17,240,    C is correct  The item  retained earnings  is a component of shareholders  equity 
18,240,    B is correct  Share repurchases reduce the company s cash  an asset   Shareholders  equity is  reduced because there are fewer shares outstanding and treasury stock is an offset to owners  equity 
19,240,    B is correct  Common size analysis  as presented in the reading  provides information about  composition of the balance sheet and changes over time  As a result it can provide information about  an increase or decrease in a company s financial leverage

2,241,    A is correct  The current ratio provides a comparison of assets that can be turned into cash relatively  quickly and liabilities that must be paid within one year  The other ratios are more suited to longer  term concerns 
3,241,    A is correct  The cash ratio determines how much of a company s near term obligations can be  settled with existing amounts of cash and marketable securities 
4,241,    C is correct  The debt to equity ratio a solvency ratio is an indicator of financial risk 
5,241,    B is correct  The quick ratio   Cash   Marketable securities   Receivables    Current liabilities  is                                       Given the placement of other financial assets between cash  and receivables it is reasonable to assume these are highly liquid and are probably marketable  securities 
6,241,    C is correct  The financial leverage ratio  Total assets   Total equity  is                       
7,241,    C is correct  The presence of goodwill on Company A s balance sheet signifies that it has made one  or more acquisitions in the past  The current cash and quick ratios are lower for Company A than  for the sector average  These lower liquidity ratios imply above average liquidity risk  The total debt  long term debt to equity debt to equity and financial leverage ratios are lower for Company B than  for the sector average  These lower solvency ratios imply below average solvency risk 
8,241,Current ratio is                for Company A versus                for the sector average 
9,241,Cash ratio is                   for Company A versus                   for the sector average 
10,241,Quick ratio is                       for Company A versus                        for the sector  average 
11,241,Total debt ratio is                 for Company B versus                 for the sector average 
12,241,Long term debt to equity ratio is                for Company B versus                for the sector  average 
13,241,Debt to equity ratio is                for Company B versus                for the sector average 
14,241,Financial leverage ratio is                 for Company B versus                 for the sector  average 
15,241,    A is correct  The quick ratio is defined as  Cash and cash equivalents   Marketable securities    receivables    Current liabilities  For Company A this calculation is                       
16,241,    C is correct  The financial leverage ratio is defined as Total assets   Total equity  For Company B  total assets are     and total equity is     hence the financial leverage ratio is               
17,241,    A is correct  The cash ratio is defined as  Cash   Marketable securities  Current liabilities  Company  A s cash ratio                   is higher than                   for Company B

3,244,   INTRODUCTION
4,244,The cash flow statement provides information about a company s cash receipts and cash  payments during an accounting period  The cash based information provided by the cash flow  statement contrasts with the accrual based information from the income statement  For  example the income statement reflects revenues when earned rather than when cash is  collected  in contrast the cash flow statement reflects cash receipts when collected as opposed  to when the revenue was earned  A reconciliation between reported income and cash flows from  operating activities provides useful information about when whether and how a company is  able to generate cash from its operating activities  Although income is an important measure of  the results of a company s activities cash flow is also essential  As an extreme illustration a  hypothetical company that makes all sales on account without regard to whether it will ever  collect its accounts receivable would report healthy sales on its income statement and might  well report significant income  however with zero cash inflow the company would not survive   The cash flow statement also provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending cash on the  balance sheet 
5,244,In addition to information about cash generated  or alternatively cash used  in operating  activities the cash flow statement provides information about cash provided  or used  in a  company s investing and financing activities  This information allows the analyst to answer  such questions as 
6,244,  Does the company generate enough cash from its operations to pay for its new  investments or is the company relying on new debt issuance to finance them 
7,244,  Does the company pay its dividends to common stockholders using cash generated from  operations from selling assets or from issuing debt 
8,244,Answers to these questions are important because in theory generating cash from operations  can continue indefinitely but generating cash from selling assets for example is possible only  as long as there are assets to sell  Similarly generating cash from debt financing is possible only  as long as lenders are willing to lend and the lending decision depends on expectations that the  company will ultimately have adequate cash to repay its obligations  In summary information  about the sources and uses of cash helps creditors investors and other statement users evaluate  the company s liquidity solvency and financial flexibility

2,245,This reading explains how cash flow activities are reflected in a company s cash flow  statement  The reading is organized as follows  Section   describes the components and format  of the cash flow statement including the classification of cash flows under International  Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  and US generally accepted accounting principles   GAAP  and the direct and indirect formats for presenting the cash flow statement  Section    discusses the linkages of the cash flow statement with the income statement and balance sheet  and the steps in the preparation of the cash flow statement  Section   demonstrates the analysis  of cash flow statements including the conversion of an indirect cash flow statement to the  direct method and how to use common size cash flow analysis free cash flow measures and  cash flow ratios used in security analysis  A summary of the key points and practice problems  in the CFA Institute multiple choice format conclude the reading 
3,245,   COMPONENTS AND FORMAT OF THE CASH  FLOW STATEMENT
4,245,The analyst needs to be able to extract and interpret information on cash flows from financial  statements  The basic components and allowable formats of the cash flow statement are well  established 
5,245,  The cash flow statement has subsections relating specific items to the operating  investing and financing activities of the company 
6,245,  Two presentation formats for the operating section are allowable  direct and indirect 
7,245,The following discussion presents these topics in greater detail 
8,245,     Classification of Cash Flows and Non Cash Activities
9,245,All companies engage in operating investing and financing activities  These activities are the  classifications used in the cash flow statement under both IFRS and US GAAP and are  described as follows  
10,245,  Operating activities include the company s day to day activities that create revenues  such as selling inventory and providing services and other activities not classified as  investing or financing  Cash inflows result from cash sales and from collection of  accounts receivable  Examples include cash receipts from the provision of services and  royalties commissions and other revenue  To generate revenue companies undertake  such activities as manufacturing inventory purchasing inventory from suppliers and  paying employees  Cash outflows result from cash payments for inventory salaries  taxes and other operating related expenses and from paying accounts payable   Additionally operating activities include cash receipts and payments related to dealing  securities or trading securities  as opposed to buying or selling securities as  investments as discussed below

2,246,  Investing activities include purchasing and selling long term assets and other  investments  These long term assets and other investments include property plant and  equipment  intangible assets  other long term assets  and both long term and short term  investments in the equity and debt  bonds and loans  issued by other companies  For this  purpose investments in equity and debt securities exclude a  any securities considered  cash equivalents  very short term highly liquid securities  and b  securities held for  dealing or trading purposes the purchase and sale of which are considered operating  activities even for companies where this is not a primary business activity  Cash inflows  in the investing category include cash receipts from the sale of non trading securities   property plant and equipment  intangibles  and other long term assets  Cash outflows  include cash payments for the purchase of these assets 
3,246,  Financing activities include obtaining or repaying capital such as equity and long term  debt  The two primary sources of capital are shareholders and creditors  Cash inflows in  this category include cash receipts from issuing stock  common or preferred  or bonds  and cash receipts from borrowing  Cash outflows include cash payments to repurchase  stock  e g  treasury stock  and to repay bonds and other borrowings  Note that indirect  borrowing using accounts payable is not considered a financing activity such borrowing  is classified as an operating activity  The new IFRS standard relating to lease accounting   IFRS     affects how operating leases are represented in the cash flow statement   Under  IFRS    operating leases are treated similarly to finance leases that is the interest  component of lease payments will be reflected in either the operating or financing  section and the principal component of lease payments is included in the financing  section 
4,246,EXAMPLE  
5,246,Net Cash Flow from Investing Activities
6,246,A company recorded the following in Year   
7,246,Proceeds from issuance of long term debt         Purchase of equipment         Loss on sale of equipment        Proceeds from sale of equipment         Equity in earnings of affiliate       
8,246,On the Year   statement of cash flows the company would report net cash flow from  investing activities closest to 
9,246,A            
10,246,B

2,247,Solution
3,247,B is correct  The only two items that would affect the investing section are the purchase  of equipment and the proceeds from sale of equipment                                   The loss on sale of equipment and the equity in earnings of affiliate affect net  income but are not cash flows  The issuance of debt is a financing cash flow 
4,247,IFRS provide companies with choices in reporting some items of cash flow particularly interest  and dividends  IFRS explain that although for a financial institution interest paid and received  would normally be classified as operating activities for other entities alternative classifications  may be appropriate  For this reason under IFRS interest received may be classified either as an  operating activity or as an investing activity  Under IFRS interest paid may be classified as  either an operating activity or a financing activity  Furthermore under IFRS dividends received  may be classified as either an operating activity or an investing activity and dividends paid may  be classified as either an operating activity or a financing activity  Companies must use a  consistent classification from year to year and disclose separately the amounts of interest and  dividends received and paid and where the amounts are reported 
5,247,Under US GAAP discretion is not permitted in classifying interest and dividends  Interest  received and interest paid are reported as operating activities for all companies   Under US  GAAP dividends received are always reported as operating activities and dividends paid are  always reported as financing activities 
6,247,EXAMPLE  
7,247,Operating versus Financing Cash Flows
8,247,On    December      a company issued a            day note at   percent and used  the cash received to pay for inventory and issued         long term debt at    percent  annually and used the cash received to pay for new equipment  Which of the following  most accurately reflects the combined effect of both transactions on the company s cash  flows for the year ended    December      under IFRS  Cash flows from 
9,247,A  operations are unchanged 
10,247,B  financing increase         
11,247,C  operations decrease        
12,247,Solution 
13,247,C is correct  The payment for inventory would decrease cash flows from operations  The  issuance of debt  both short term and long term debt  is part of financing activities and  would increase cash flows from financing activities by          The purchase of  equipment is an investing activity  Note that the treatment under US GAAP would be  the same for these transactions

2,248,Companies may also engage in non cash investing and financing transactions  A non cash  transaction is any transaction that does not involve an inflow or outflow of cash  For example if  a company exchanges one non monetary asset for another non monetary asset no cash is  involved  Similarly no cash is involved when a company issues common stock either for  dividends or in connection with conversion of a convertible bond or convertible preferred stock   Because no cash is involved in non cash transactions  by definition  these transactions are not  incorporated in the cash flow statement  However because such transactions may affect a  company s capital or asset structures any significant non cash transaction is required to be  disclosed either in a separate note or a supplementary schedule to the cash flow statement 
3,248,     A Summary of Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
4,248,As highlighted in the previous section there are some differences in cash flow statements  prepared under IFRS and US GAAP that the analyst should be aware of when comparing the  cash flow statements of companies prepared in accordance with different sets of standards  The  key differences are summarized in Exhibit    Most significantly IFRS allow more flexibility in  the reporting of such items as interest paid or received and dividends paid or received and in  how income tax expense is classified 
5,248,US GAAP classify interest and dividends received from investments as operating activities  whereas IFRS allow companies to classify those items as either operating or investing cash  flows  Likewise US GAAP classify interest expense as an operating activity even though the  principal amount of the debt issued is classified as a financing activity  IFRS allow companies  to classify interest expense as either an operating activity or a financing activity  US GAAP  classify dividends paid to stockholders as a financing activity whereas IFRS allow companies  to classify dividends paid as either an operating activity or a financing activity 
6,248,US GAAP classify all income tax expenses as an operating activity  IFRS also classify income  tax expense as an operating activity unless the tax expense can be specifically identified with  an investing or financing activity  e g  the tax effect of the sale of a discontinued operation  could be classified under investing activities

12,249,Under either set of standards companies currently have a choice of formats for presenting cash  flow statements as discussed in the next section 
13,249,     Direct and Indirect Methods for Reporting Cash Flow from  Operating Activities
14,249,There are two acceptable formats for reporting cash flow from operating activities  also  known as cash flow from operations or operating cash flow  defined as the net amount of  cash provided from operating activities  the direct and the indirect methods  The amount of  operating cash flow is identical under both methods  only the presentation format of the  operating cash flow section differs  The presentation format of the cash flows from investing  and financing is exactly the same regardless of which method is used to present operating cash  flows 
15,249,The direct method shows the specific cash inflows and outflows that result in reported cash  flow from operating activities  It shows each cash inflow and outflow related to a company s  cash receipts and disbursements  In other words the direct method eliminates any impact of  accruals and shows only cash receipts and cash payments  The primary argument in favor of the  direct method is that it provides information on the specific sources of operating cash receipts  and payments  This is in contrast to the indirect method which shows only the net result of  these receipts and payments  Just as information on the specific sources of revenues and  expenses is more useful than knowing only the net result net income the analyst gets  additional information from a direct format cash flow statement  The additional information is  useful in understanding historical performance and in predicting future operating cash flows

2,250,The indirect method shows how cash flow from operations can be obtained from reported net  income as the result of a series of adjustments  The indirect format begins with net income  To  reconcile net income with operating cash flow adjustments are made for non cash items for  non operating items and for the net changes in operating accruals  The main argument for the  indirect approach is that it shows the reasons for differences between net income and operating  cash flows   However the differences between net income and operating cash flows are equally  visible on an indirect format cash flow statement and in the supplementary reconciliation  required under US GAAP if the company uses the direct method   Another argument for the  indirect method is that it mirrors a forecasting approach that begins by forecasting future  income and then derives cash flows by adjusting for changes in balance sheet accounts that  occur because of the timing differences between accrual and cash accounting 
3,250,IFRS and US GAAP both encourage the use of the direct method but permit either method  US  GAAP encourage the use of the direct method but also require companies to present a  reconciliation between net income and cash flow  which is equivalent to the indirect method    If the indirect method is chosen no direct format disclosures are required  The majority of  companies reporting under IFRS or US GAAP present using the indirect method for operating  cash flows 
4,250,Many users of financial statements prefer the direct format particularly analysts and  commercial lenders because of the importance of information about operating receipts and  payments in assessing a company s financing needs and capacity to repay existing obligations   Preparers argue that adjusting net income to operating cash flow as in the indirect format is  easier and less costly than reporting gross operating cash receipts and payments as in the direct  format  With advances in accounting systems and technology it is not clear that gathering the  information required to use the direct method is difficult or costly  CFA Institute has advocated  that standard setters require the use of the direct format for the main presentation of the cash  flow statement with indirect cash flows as supplementary disclosure

24,252,Beginning first at the bottom of the statement we note that cash increased from      million at  the beginning of      to       million at the end of      with the largest increase occurring  in       To understand the changes we next examine the sections of the statement  In each  year the primary cash inflow derived from operating activities as would be expected for a  mature company in a relatively stable industry  In each year the operating cash flow was more  than the reported net profit again as would be expected from a mature company with the  largest differences primarily arising from the add back of depreciation  Also in each year the  operating cash flow was more than enough to cover the company s capital expenditures  For  example in      the company generated       million in net cash from operating activities  and as shown in the investing section spent       million on property plant and  equipment        million net of      million proceeds from disposals   Also as shown in the  investing section the main reason for the large increase in cash in      was the       million  inflow from the disposal of group companies joint ventures and associates 
25,252,The financing section of the statement shows that each year the company returned about       billion to its common shareholders and around      million to its debt holders and preferred  shareholders via interest and dividends  The company also repurchased about      billion in  common stock in both      and       In      the company repaid debt  repayments of        million exceeded additional financing liabilities of       million

2,253,Having examined each section of the statement we return to the operating activities section of  Unilever s cash flow statement which presents a reconciliation of net profit to net cash flow  from operating activities  i e  uses the indirect method   The following discussion of certain  adjustments to reconcile net profit to operating cash flows explains some of the main  reconciliation adjustments and refers to the amounts in       The first adjustment adds back the        million income tax expense  labeled  Taxation   that had been recognized as an expense  in the computation of net profit  A      million deduction for the  cash  income taxes paid is  then shown separately as the last item in the operating activities section consistent with the  IFRS requirement that cash flows arising from income taxes be separately disclosed  The  classification of taxes on income paid should be indicated  The classification is in operating  activities unless the taxes can be specifically identified with financing or investing activities 
3,253,The next adjustment  removes  from the operating cash flow section the      million  representing Unilever s share of joint ventures  income that had been included in the  computation of net profit  A      million inflow of  cash  dividends received from those joint  ventures is then shown in the investing activities section  Similarly a      million adjustment  removes the net finance costs from the operating activities section  Unilever then reports its      million  cash  interest received in the investing activities section and its      million  cash   interest paid  and preference dividends paid  in the financing activities section  The next  adjustment in the operating section of this indirect method statement adds back       million  depreciation amortisation and impairment all of which are expenses that had been deducted in  the computation of net income but which did not involve any outflow of cash in the period  The        million adjustment for changes in working capital is necessary because these changes  result from applying accrual accounting and thus do not necessarily correspond to the actual  cash movement  These adjustments are described in greater detail in a later section 
4,253,In summary some observations from an analysis of Unilever s cash flow statement include 
5,253,  Total cash increased from      million at the beginning of      to       million at the  end of      with the largest increase occurring in      
6,253,  In each year the operating cash flow was more than the reported net profit as would  generally be expected from a mature company 
7,253,  In each year the operating cash flow was more than enough to cover the company s  capital expenditures 
8,253,  The company returned cash to its equity investors through dividends in each year and  through share buybacks in      and

5,255,    
6,255,As shown at the bottom of the statement cash and cash equivalents increased from        million at the beginning of      to       million at the end of       The largest increase in  cash occurred in      with      showing a decrease  Cash from operations was the primary  source of cash consistent with the profile of a mature company in a relatively stable industry   Each year the company generated significantly more cash from operations than it required for  its capital expenditures  For example in      the company generated       billion cash from  operations and spent as shown in the investing section only      billion on property plant  and equipment        million net of      million from disposals   Another notable item from  the investing section is the company s limited acquisition activity in      compared with       and       In both      and      the company made over    billion of acquisitions and in       the company also received      billion from disposals  Instead of using cash for  acquisition activity in      when net acquisitions used only     million      million  acquisitions net of     million from disposals  the company invested       million in  financial investments excluded from cash and cash equivalents  i e  long term financial  investments  
7,255,As shown in the financing section in      the net cash inflow from debt issuance was        million        million proceeds from debentures and bonds plus       million proceeds from  loans borrowings and promissory notes net of repayments and cancellations totaling        million  
8,255,In summary some observations from an analysis of Telef nica s cash flow statement include
9,255,  Total cash and cash equivalents increased over the three year period with      showing  the biggest increase 
10,255,  Cash from operating activities was large enough in each year to cover the company s  capital expenditures 
11,255,  The amount paid for property plant and equipment and intangible assets was the largest  investing expenditure each year and did not significantly vary from year to year 
12,255,  The company had a significant amount of acquisition and divestiture activity in      and       but not in      
13,255,  The company paid an increasing amount of dividends over the three year period 
14,255,An analyst can also make some comparisons between the income statement  not shown here   and the statement of cash flows  For example contrast the change in revenues from the income  statement to the change in cash received from customers  An increase in revenues coupled with  a decrease in cash received from customers for example could signal collection problems  As  shown in Exhibit   cash received from customers in      decreased      percent compared  with      from        million to        million  The company reported revenues on the  income statement of        million and        million for      and      respectively   Thus the decrease in cash received from customers was slightly greater than the      percent  decrease in total revenue and would not in itself indicate any collection issue

15,258,Tech Data Corporation prepares its cash flow statements under the direct method  The  company s cash increased from      million at the beginning of      to      billion at the end  of January      with the biggest increase occurring in the most recent year  The      increase  was driven by changes across all three sections of the statement  In the cash flows from  operating activities section of Tech Data s cash flow statements the company identifies the  amount of cash it received from customers       billion for      and the amount of cash that  it paid to suppliers and employees       billion for       Cash receipts decreased from        billion in the prior year but cash paid decreased by even more such that cash provided by  operating activities increased in      compared with       Net cash provided by operating  activities of        million was adequate to cover the company s investing activities primarily  purchases of property and equipment        million  and software development        million    Overall investing activities in      used far less cash than in      primarily because of  reduced amounts of cash used for acquisition of businesses  In      the company issued      million of common stock and received       million in contributions and borrowings from its  joint venture partner providing net cash from financing activities of       million after its debt  repayments 
16,258,Whenever the direct method is used US GAAP require a disclosure note and a schedule that  reconciles net income with the net cash flow from operating activities  Tech Data shows this  reconciliation at the bottom of its consolidated statements of cash flows  The disclosure note  and reconciliation schedule are exactly the information that would have been presented in the  body of the cash flow statement if the company had elected to use the indirect method rather  than the direct method  For      the reconciliation highlights an increase in the company s  accounts receivable a decrease in inventory and a significant increase in payables 
17,258,In summary some observations from an analysis of Tech Data s cash flow statement include 
18,258,  The company s cash increased by                    or                   million over  the three years ending in January      with the biggest increase occurring in the most  recent year 
19,258,  The company s operating cash was adequate to cover the company s investments in all  three years 
20,258,  In      the company issued stock and received financing from its joint venture partner  which provided the company with a stronger cash cushion

25,260,Walmart s cash flow statement indicates the following 
26,260,  Cash and cash equivalents changed only slightly over the three years from      billion at  the beginning of fiscal      to      billion at the end of fiscal      but year to year cash  flows varied significantly 
27,260,  Operating cash flow increased steadily from       billion in fiscal      to       billion  in      and was significantly greater than the company s expenditures on property and  equipment in every year 
28,260,  In      and      the company used cash to repay borrowing to pay dividends and to  repurchase its common stock 
29,260,Walmart prepares its cash flow statements under the indirect method  In the cash flows from  operating activities section of Walmart s cash flow statement the company reconciles its net  income of       billion to net cash provided by operating activities of       billion  Whenever  the indirect method is used US GAAP mandate disclosure of how much cash was paid for  interest and income taxes  Note that these are line items in cash flow statements using the direct  method so disclosure does not have to be mandated  Walmart discloses the amount of cash paid  for income tax       billion  interest       billion  and capital lease obligations      million   at the bottom of its cash flow statements

2,261,   THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT  LINKAGES  AND PREPARATION
3,261,The indirect format of the cash flow statement demonstrates that changes in balance sheet  accounts are an important factor in determining cash flows  The next section addresses the  linkages between the cash flow statement and other financial statements 
4,261,     Linkages of the Cash Flow Statement with the Income  Statement and Balance Sheet
5,261,Recall the accounting equation that summarizes the balance sheet 
6,261,Assets   Liabilities   Equity
7,261,Cash is an asset  The statement of cash flows ultimately shows the change in cash during an  accounting period  The beginning and ending balances of cash are shown on the company s  balance sheets for the previous and current years and the bottom of the cash flow statement  reconciles beginning cash with ending cash  The relationship stated in general terms is as  shown below 
8,261,Beginning  Balance Sheet at     December    X  Beginning  cash
9,261,Statement of Cash Flows for Year Ended    December   X  Plus  Cash receipts  from  Less  Cash payments  for  operating investing and  operating investing and  financing activities  financing activities 
10,261,Ending  Balance  Sheet at     December    X  Ending cash
11,261,In the case of cash held in foreign currencies there would also be an impact from changes in  exchange rates  For example Walmart s cash flow statement for      presented in Exhibit    shows cash flows from operating investing and financing activities that total      million  during the year                             Combined with the      million net effect of  exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents the net increase in cash and cash equivalents was       million the amount by which end of year cash and cash equivalents         exceeds  beginning of year cash and cash equivalents         
12,261,The body of Walmart s cash flow statement shows why the change in cash occurred  in other  words it shows the company s operating investing and financing activities  as well as the  impact of foreign currency translation   The beginning and ending balance sheet values of cash  and cash equivalents are linked through the cash flow statement

2,262,The current assets and current liabilities sections of the balance sheet typically reflect a  company s operating decisions and activities  Because a company s operating activities are  reported on an accrual basis in the income statement any differences between the accrual basis  and the cash basis of accounting for an operating transaction result in an increase or decrease in  some  usually  short term asset or liability on the balance sheet  For example if revenue  reported using accrual accounting is higher than the cash actually collected the result will  typically be an increase in accounts receivable  If expenses reported using accrual accounting  are lower than cash actually paid the result will typically be a decrease in accounts payable or  another accrued liability account   As an example of how items on the balance sheet are related  to the income statement and or cash flow statement through the change in the beginning and  ending balances consider accounts receivable 
3,262,Beginning  Balance Sheet at    December    X  Beginning  accounts  receivable
4,262,Income Statement for  Year Ended     December   X  Plus  Revenues
5,262,Statement of Cash Flows  for Year Ended     December   X  Minus  Cash collected  from customers
6,262,Ending Balance  Sheet at    December    X  Equals  Ending  accounts  receivable
7,262,Knowing any three of these four items makes it easy to compute the fourth  For example if you  know beginning accounts receivable revenues and cash collected from customers you can  easily compute ending accounts receivable  Understanding the interrelationships between the  balance sheet income statement and cash flow statement is useful in not only understanding  the company s financial health but also in detecting accounting irregularities  Recall the  extreme illustration of a hypothetical company that makes sales on account without regard to  future collections and thus reports healthy sales and significant income on its income statement  yet lacks cash inflow  Such a pattern would occur if a company improperly recognized revenue 
8,262,A company s investing activities typically relate to the long term asset section of the balance  sheet and its financing activities typically relate to the equity and long term debt sections of the  balance sheet  The next section demonstrates the preparation of cash flow information based on  income statement and balance sheet information 
9,262,     Steps in Preparing the Cash Flow Statement
10,262,The preparation of the cash flow statement uses data from both the income statement and the  comparative balance sheets 
11,262,As noted earlier companies often only disclose indirect operating cash flow information  whereas analysts prefer direct format information  Understanding how cash flow information is  put together will enable you to take an indirect statement apart and reconfigure it in a more  useful manner  The result is an approximation of a direct cash flow statement which while  not perfectly accurate can be helpful to an analyst  The following demonstration of how an  approximation of a direct cash flow statement is prepared uses the income statement and the  comparative balance sheets for Acme Corporation  a fictitious retail company  shown in

6,264, During      Acme purchased new equipment for a total cost of        No items impacted retained  earnings other than net income and dividends 
7,264,The first step in preparing the cash flow statement is to determine the total cash flows from  operating activities  The direct method of presenting cash from operating activities is illustrated  in sections       through        Section       illustrates the indirect method of presenting cash  flows from operating activities  Cash flows from investing activities and from financing  activities are identical under either method 
8,264,       Operating Activities  Direct Method
9,264,We first determine how much cash Acme received from its customers followed by how much  cash was paid to suppliers and to employees as well as how much cash was paid for other  operating expenses interest and income taxes 
10,264,         Cash Received from Customers
11,264,The income statement for Acme reported revenue of        for the year ended    December        To determine the approximate cash receipts from its customers it is necessary to adjust  this revenue amount by the net change in accounts receivable for the year  If accounts  receivable increase during the year revenue on an accrual basis is higher than cash receipts  from customers and vice versa  For Acme Corporation accounts receivable increased by      so cash received from customers was        as follows 
12,264,Revenue Less  Increase in accounts receivable Cash received from customers
13,264,                  
14,264,Cash received from customers affects the accounts receivable account as follows 
15,264,Beginning accounts receivable Plus revenue Minus cash collected from customers Ending accounts receivable
16,264,                       
17,264,The accounts receivable account information can also be presented as follows

2,265,Beginning accounts receivable Plus revenue Minus ending accounts receivable Cash collected from customers
3,265,                        
4,265,EXAMPLE  
5,265,Computing Cash Received from Customers
6,265,Blue Bayou a fictitious advertising company reported revenues of     million total  expenses of     million and net income of     million in the most recent year  If  accounts receivable decreased by     million how much cash did the company receive  from customers 
7,265,A      million 
8,265,B      million 
9,265,C      million 
10,265,Solution 
11,265,C is correct  Revenues of     million plus the decrease in accounts receivable of      million equals     million cash received from customers  The decrease in accounts  receivable means that the company received more in cash than the amount of revenue it  reported 
12,265, Cash received from customers  is sometimes referred to as  cash collections from customers   or  cash collections  
13,265,         Cash Paid to Suppliers
14,265,For Acme the cash paid to suppliers was        determined as follows 
15,265,Cost of goods sold Plus  Increase in inventory Equals purchases from suppliers Less  Increase in accounts payable Cash paid to suppliers
16,265,                              
17,265,There are two pieces to this calculation  the amount of inventory purchased and the amount paid  for it  To determine purchases from suppliers cost of goods sold is adjusted for the change in  inventory  If inventory increased during the year then purchases during the year exceeded cost  of goods sold and vice versa  Acme reported cost of goods sold of        for the year ended     December       For Acme Corporation inventory increased by      so purchases from  suppliers was         Purchases from suppliers affect the inventory account as shown below

2,266,Beginning inventory       Plus purchases       Minus cost of goods sold         Ending inventory      
3,266,Acme purchased        of inventory from suppliers in      but is this the amount of cash  that Acme paid to its suppliers during the year  Not necessarily  Acme may not have yet paid  for all of these purchases and may yet owe for some of the purchases made this year  In other  words Acme may have paid less cash to its suppliers than the amount of this year s purchases  in which case Acme s liability  accounts payable  will have increased by the difference   Alternatively Acme may have paid even more to its suppliers than the amount of this year s  purchases in which case Acme s accounts payable will have decreased 
4,266,Therefore once purchases have been determined cash paid to suppliers can be calculated by  adjusting purchases for the change in accounts payable  If the company made all purchases with  cash then accounts payable would not change and cash outflows would equal purchases  If  accounts payable increased during the year then purchases on an accrual basis would be higher  than they would be on a cash basis and vice versa  In this example Acme made more purchases  than it paid in cash so the balance in accounts payable increased  For Acme the cash paid to  suppliers was        determined as follows 
5,266,Purchases from suppliers Less  Increase in accounts payable Cash paid to suppliers
6,266,                   
7,266,The amount of cash paid to suppliers is reflected in the accounts payable account as shown  below 
8,266,Beginning accounts payable Plus purchases Minus cash paid to suppliers Ending accounts payable

5,267,To determine the cash paid to employees it is necessary to adjust salary and wages expense by  the net change in salary and wages payable for the year  If salary and wages payable increased  during the year then salary and wages expense on an accrual basis would be higher than the  amount of cash paid for this expense and vice versa  For Acme salary and wages payable  increased by     so cash paid for salary and wages was       as follows 
6,267,Salary and wages expense Less  Increase in salary and wages payable Cash paid to employees
7,267,                
8,267,The amount of cash paid to employees is reflected in the salary and wages payable account as  shown below 
9,267,Beginning salary and wages payable Plus salary and wages expense Minus cash paid to employees Ending salary and wages payable
10,267,                   
11,267,         Cash Paid for Other Operating Expenses
12,267,To determine the cash paid for other operating expenses it is necessary to adjust the other  operating expenses amount on the income statement by the net changes in prepaid expenses and  accrued expense liabilities for the year  If prepaid expenses increased during the year other  operating expenses on a cash basis would be higher than on an accrual basis and vice versa   Likewise if accrued expense liabilities increased during the year other operating expenses on a  cash basis would be lower than on an accrual basis and vice versa  For Acme Corporation the  amount of cash paid for operating expenses in      was       as follows 
13,267,Other operating expenses Less  Decrease in prepaid expenses Less  Increase in other accrued liabilities Cash paid for other operating expenses

2,268,Computing Cash Paid for Other Operating  Expenses
3,268,Black Ice a fictitious sportswear manufacturer reported other operating expenses of      million  Prepaid insurance expense increased by    million and accrued utilities  payable decreased by    million  Insurance and utilities are the only two components of  other operating expenses  How much cash did the company pay in other operating  expenses 
4,268,A      million 
5,268,B      million 
6,268,C      million 
7,268,Solution 
8,268,C is correct  Other operating expenses of     million plus the increase in prepaid  insurance expense of    million plus the decrease in accrued utilities payable of     million equals     million 
9,268,         Cash Paid for Interest
10,268,The cash paid for interest is included in operating cash flows under US GAAP and may be  included in operating or financing cash flows under IFRS  To determine the cash paid for  interest it is necessary to adjust interest expense by the net change in interest payable for the  year  If interest payable increases during the year then interest expense on an accrual basis will  be higher than the amount of cash paid for interest and vice versa  For Acme Corporation  interest payable decreased by     and cash paid for interest was      as follows 
11,268,Interest expense Plus  Decrease in interest payable Cash paid for interest
12,268,            
13,268,Alternatively cash paid for interest may also be determined by an analysis of the interest  payable account as shown below

2,269,         Cash Paid for Income Taxes
3,269,To determine the cash paid for income taxes it is necessary to adjust the income tax expense  amount on the income statement by the net changes in taxes receivable taxes payable and  deferred income taxes for the year  If taxes receivable or deferred tax assets increase during the  year income taxes on a cash basis will be higher than on an accrual basis and vice versa   Likewise if taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities increase during the year income tax  expense on a cash basis will be lower than on an accrual basis and vice versa  For Acme  Corporation the amount of cash paid for income taxes in      was       as follows 
4,269,Income tax expense Less  Increase in income tax payable Cash paid for income taxes
5,269,               
6,269,       Investing Activities
7,269,The second and third steps in preparing the cash flow statement are to determine the total cash  flows from investing activities and from financing activities  The presentation of this  information is identical regardless of whether the direct or indirect method is used for operating  cash flows 
8,269,Purchases and sales of equipment were the only investing activities undertaken by Acme in       as evidenced by the fact that the amounts reported for land and buildings were unchanged  during the year  An informational note in Exhibit   tells us that Acme purchased new  equipment in      for a total cost of        However the amount of equipment shown on  Acme s balance sheet increased by only       ending balance of       minus beginning  balance of         therefore Acme must have also sold or otherwise disposed of some  equipment during the year  To determine the cash inflow from the sale of equipment we  analyze the equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts as well as the gain on the sale of  equipment from Exhibits   and    Assuming that the entire accumulated depreciation is related  to equipment the cash received from sale of equipment is determined as follows 
9,269,The historical cost of the equipment sold was        This amount is determined as follows 
10,269,Beginning balance equipment  from balance sheet  Plus equipment purchased  from informational note  Minus ending balance equipment  from balance sheet  Equals historical cost of equipment sold
11,269,                       
12,269,The accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold was      determined as follows 
13,269,Beginning balance accumulated depreciation  from balance sheet  Plus depreciation expense  from income statement  Minus ending balance accumulated depreciation  from balance sheet  Equals accumulated depreciation on equipment sold

2,270,The historical cost information accumulated depreciation information and information from  the income statement about the gain on the sale of equipment can be used to determine the cash  received from the sale 
3,270,Historical cost of equipment sold  calculated above  Less accumulated depreciation on equipment sold  calculated above  Equals book value of equipment sold Plus gain on sale of equipment  from the income statement  Equals cash received from sale of equipment
4,270,                         
5,270,EXAMPLE  
6,270,Computing Cash Received from the Sale of  Equipment
7,270,Copper Inc  a fictitious brewery and restaurant chain reported a gain on the sale of  equipment of     million  In addition the company s income statement shows  depreciation expense of    million and the cash flow statement shows capital  expenditure of     million all of which was for the purchase of new equipment 
8,270,Balance sheet item                       Change Equipment      million      million    million Accumulated depreciation equipment     million     million    million
9,270,Using the above information from the comparative balance sheets how much cash did  the company receive from the equipment sale 
10,270,A      million 
11,270,B      million 
12,270,C      million 
13,270,Solution 
14,270,B is correct  Selling price  cash inflow  minus book value equals gain or loss on sale   therefore gain or loss on sale plus book value equals selling price  cash inflow   The  amount of gain is given     million  To calculate the book value of the equipment sold  find the historical cost of the equipment and the accumulated depreciation on the  equipment 
15,270,  Beginning balance of equipment of      million plus equipment purchased of      million minus ending balance of equipment of      million equals historical cost  of equipment sold or    million

2,271,  Beginning accumulated depreciation on equipment of     million plus  depreciation expense for the year of    million minus ending balance of  accumulated depreciation of     million equals accumulated depreciation on the  equipment sold or    million 
3,271,  Therefore the book value of the equipment sold was    million minus    million  or    million 
4,271,  Because the gain on the sale of equipment was     million the amount of cash  received must have been     million 
5,271,       Financing Activities
6,271,As with investing activities the presentation of financing activities is identical regardless of  whether the direct or indirect method is used for operating cash flows 
7,271,         Long Term Debt and Common Stock
8,271,The change in long term debt based on the beginning       ending       and ending       balances in Exhibit   was a decrease of       Absent other information this indicates that  Acme retired      of long term debt  Retiring long term debt is a cash outflow relating to  financing activities 
9,271,Similarly the change in common stock during      was a decrease of       Absent other  information this indicates that Acme repurchased      of its common stock  Repurchase of  common stock is also a cash outflow related to financing activity 
10,271,         Dividends
11,271,Recall the following relationship 
12,271,Beginning retained earnings   Net income   Dividends   Ending retained earnings
13,271,Based on this relationship the amount of cash dividends paid in      can be determined from  an analysis of retained earnings as follows 
14,271,Beginning balance of retained earnings  from the balance sheet  Plus net income  from the income statement  Minus ending balance of retained earnings  from the balance sheet  Equals dividends paid
15,271,                       
16,271,Note that dividends paid are presented in the statement of changes in equity

11,272,       Overall Statement of Cash Flows  Indirect Method
12,272,Using the alternative approach to reporting cash from operating activities the indirect method  we will present the same amount of cash provided by operating activities  Under this approach  we reconcile Acme s net income of       to its operating cash flow of

2,273,To perform this reconciliation net income is adjusted for the following  a  any non operating  activities b  any non cash expenses and c  changes in operating working capital items 
3,273,The only non operating activity in Acme s income statement the sale of equipment resulted in  a gain of       This amount is removed from the operating cash flow section  the cash effects  of the sale are shown in the investing section 
4,273,Acme s only non cash expense was depreciation expense of        Under the indirect method  depreciation expense must be added back to net income because it was a non cash deduction in  the calculation of net income 
5,273,Changes in working capital accounts include increases and decreases in the current operating  asset and liability accounts  The changes in these accounts arise from applying accrual  accounting  that is recognizing revenues when they are earned and expenses when they are  incurred instead of when the cash is received or paid  To make the working capital adjustments  under the indirect method any increase in a current operating asset account is subtracted from  net income and a net decrease is added to net income  As described above the increase in  accounts receivable for example resulted from Acme recording income statement revenue  higher than the amount of cash received from customers  therefore to reconcile back to  operating cash flow that increase in accounts receivable must be deducted from net income  For  current operating liabilities a net increase is added to net income and a net decrease is  subtracted from net income  As described above the increase in wages payable for example  resulted from Acme recording income statement expenses higher than the amount of cash paid  to employees

11,276,     Conversion of Cash Flows from the Indirect to the Direct  Method
12,276,An analyst may desire to review direct format operating cash flow to review trends in cash  receipts and payments  such as cash received from customers or cash paid to suppliers   If a  direct format statement is not available cash flows from operating activities reported under the  indirect method can be converted to the direct method  Accuracy of conversion depends on  adjustments using data available in published financial reports  The method described here is  sufficiently accurate for most analytical purposes 
13,276,The three step conversion process is demonstrated for Acme Corporation in Exhibit      Referring again to Exhibits   and   for Acme Corporation s income statement and balance sheet  information begin by disaggregating net income of       into total revenues and total  expenses  Step     Next remove any non operating and non cash items  Step     For Acme we  therefore remove the non operating gain on the sale of equipment of      and the non cash  depreciation expense of        Then convert accrual amounts of revenues and expenses to  cash flow amounts of receipts and payments by adjusting for changes in working capital  accounts  Step     The results of these adjustments are the items of information for the direct  format of operating cash flows  These line items are shown as the results of Step

5,278,     Evaluation of the Sources and Uses of Cash
6,278,Evaluation of the cash flow statement should involve an overall assessment of the sources and  uses of cash between the three main categories as well as an assessment of the main drivers of  cash flow within each category as follows 
7,278,   Evaluate where the major sources and uses of cash flow are between operating investing  and financing activities 
8,278,   Evaluate the primary determinants of operating cash flow 
9,278,   Evaluate the primary determinants of investing cash flow 
10,278,   Evaluate the primary determinants of financing cash flow 
11,278,Step  
12,278,The major sources of cash for a company can vary with its stage of growth  For a mature  company it is expected and desirable that operating activities are the primary source of cash  flows  Over the long term a company must generate cash from its operating activities  If  operating cash flow were consistently negative a company would need to borrow money or  issue stock  financing activities  to fund the shortfall  Eventually these providers of capital  need to be repaid from operations or they will no longer be willing to provide capital  Cash  generated from operating activities can be used in either investing or financing activities  If the  company has good opportunities to grow the business or other investment opportunities it is  desirable to use the cash in investing activities  If the company does not have profitable  investment opportunities the cash should be returned to capital providers a financing activity   For a new or growth stage company operating cash flow may be negative for some period of  time as it invests in such assets as inventory and receivables  extending credit to new  customers  in order to grow the business  This situation is not sustainable over the long term so  eventually the cash must start to come primarily from operating activities so that capital can be  returned to the providers of capital  Lastly it is desirable that operating cash flows are sufficient  to cover capital expenditures  in other words the company has free cash flow as discussed  further in Section       In summary major points to consider at this step are

2,279,  What are the major sources and uses of cash flow 
3,279,  Is operating cash flow positive and sufficient to cover capital expenditures 
4,279,Step  
5,279,Turning to the operating section the analysts should examine the most significant determinants  of operating cash flow  Companies need cash for use in operations  for example to hold  receivables and inventory and to pay employees and suppliers  and receive cash from operating  activities  for example payments from customers   Under the indirect method the increases and  decreases in receivables inventory payables and so on can be examined to determine whether  the company is using or generating cash in operations and why  It is also useful to compare  operating cash flow with net income  For a mature company because net income includes non  cash expenses  depreciation and amortisation  it is expected and desirable that operating cash  flow exceeds net income  The relationship between net income and operating cash flow is also  an indicator of earnings quality  If a company has large net income but poor operating cash  flow it may be a sign of poor earnings quality  The company may be making aggressive  accounting choices to increase net income but not be generating cash for its business  You  should also examine the variability of both earnings and cash flow and consider the impact of  this variability on the company s risk as well as the ability to forecast future cash flows for  valuation purposes  In summary 
6,279,  What are the major determinants of operating cash flow 
7,279,  Is operating cash flow higher or lower than net income  Why 
8,279,  How consistent are operating cash flows 
9,279,Step  
10,279,Within the investing section you should evaluate each line item  Each line item represents  either a source or use of cash  This enables you to understand where the cash is being spent  or  received   This section will tell you how much cash is being invested for the future in property  plant and equipment  how much is used to acquire entire companies  and how much is put  aside in liquid investments such as stocks and bonds  It will also tell you how much cash is  being raised by selling these types of assets  If the company is making major capital  investments you should consider where the cash is coming from to cover these investments   e g  is the cash coming from excess operating cash flow or from the financing activities  described in Step     If assets are being sold it is important to determine why and to assess the  effects on the company 
11,279,Step  
12,279,Within the financing section you should examine each line item to understand whether the  company is raising capital or repaying capital and what the nature of its capital sources are  If  the company is borrowing each year you should consider when repayment may be required   This section will also present dividend payments and repurchases of stock that are alternative  means of returning capital to owners  It is important to assess why capital is being raised or  repaid

14,281,Yee would like answers to the following questions 
15,281,  What are the major sources of cash for Groupe Danone 
16,281,  What are the major uses of cash for Groupe Danone 
17,281,  What is the relationship between net income and cash flow from operating  activities 
18,281,  Is cash flow from operating activities sufficient to cover capital expenditures 
19,281,  Other than capital expenditures is cash being used or generated in investing  activities 
20,281,  What types of financing cash flows does Groupe Danone have 
21,281,Solution 
22,281,The major categories of cash flows can be summarized as follows  in   millions  
23,281,Cash flows provided by operating activities Cash flows provided by  used in  investing activities

3,282,              
4,282,           
5,282,The primary source of cash for Groupe Danone is operating activities  In      investing  activities provided cash as the result of the sale of businesses and other investments   Cash flow is being used in financing activities primarily to repay financial liabilities  and to pay dividends  The fact that the primary source of cash is from operations is  positive and desirable for a mature company  Additionally the fact that operating cash  flow exceeds net income in both years is a positive sign  Finally operating cash flows  exceed capital expenditures indicating that the company can fund capital expenditures  from operations 
6,282,     Common Size Analysis of the Statement of Cash Flows
7,282,In common size analysis of a company s income statement each income and expense line item  is expressed as a percentage of net revenues  net sales   For the common size balance sheet  each asset liability and equity line item is expressed as a percentage of total assets  For the  common size cash flow statement there are two alternative approaches  The first approach is to  express each line item of cash inflow  outflow  as a percentage of total inflows  outflows  of  cash and the second approach is to express each line item as a percentage of net revenue 
8,282,Exhibit    demonstrates the total cash inflows total cash outflows method for Acme  Corporation  Under this approach each of the cash inflows is expressed as a percentage of the  total cash inflows whereas each of the cash outflows is expressed as a percentage of the total  cash outflows  In Panel A Acme s common size statement is based on a cash flow statement  using the direct method of presenting operating cash flows  Operating cash inflows and  outflows are separately presented on the cash flow statement and therefore the common size  cash flow statement shows each of these operating inflows  outflows  as a percentage of total  inflows  outflows   In Panel B Acme s common size statement is based on a cash flow  statement using the indirect method of presenting operating cash flows  When a cash flow  statement has been presented using the indirect method operating cash inflows and outflows are  not separately presented  therefore the common size cash flow statement shows only the net  operating cash flow  net cash provided by or used in operating activities  as a percentage of  total inflows or outflows depending on whether the net amount was a cash inflow or outflow   Because Acme s net operating cash flow is positive it is shown as a percentage of total inflows

2,284,Exhibit    demonstrates the net revenue common size cash flow statement for Acme  Corporation  Under the net revenue approach each line item in the cash flow statement is  shown as a percentage of net revenue  The common size statement in this exhibit has been  developed based on Acme s cash flow statement using the indirect method for operating cash  flows and using net revenue of        as shown in Exhibit    Each line item of the  reconciliation between net income and net operating cash flows is expressed as a percentage of  net revenue  The common size format makes it easier to see trends in cash flow rather than just  looking at the total amount  This method is also useful to the analyst in forecasting future cash  flows because individual items in the common size statement  e g  depreciation fixed capital  expenditures debt borrowing and repayment  are expressed as a percentage of net revenue   Thus once the analyst has forecast revenue the common size statement provides a basis for  forecasting cash flows for those items with an expected relation to net revenue

25,286,A  Dell s depreciation and amortization expense is less than   percent of total net  revenue in the year ended    January       However as a percentage of total  revenue it has been increasing each year  In the year ended    January       adding this expense back to determine operating cash flow has a significant  impact on cash flow from operations as a percentage of total revenue because its  size was approximately    percent of net profit margin  net income total net  revenue

2,287,B  Dell s level of capital expenditures is relatively small less than   percent of  revenues in the most recent years  Cash flow from operations as a percentage of  total revenue indicates that operating cash flows are more than sufficient to cover  these expenditures 
3,287,Solution to   
4,287,Dell s operating cash flow as a percentage of revenue is usually much higher than net  profit margin with the exception of the year ended    January       In that year the net  profit margin was      percent and operating cash flow as a percentage of total revenue  was      percent  The primary difference between that year and the other years appears  to have been a significant reduction in accounts payable  in each of the other years  accounts payable increased  For the year ended    January      operating cash flow as  a percentage of total revenue was      percent and net profit margin was      percent 
5,287,Solution to   
6,287,In the year ended    January      the largest cash outflow was for an acquisition of  business  investing activities   In prior years much of Dell s operating cash flow was  used to repurchase its own stock  financing activities   In each of the three years Dell s  purchases of investments  investing activities  were less than the amounts of maturities  and sales  thus on a net basis investments provided a net source of cash 
7,287,     Free Cash Flow to the Firm and Free Cash Flow to Equity
8,287,It was mentioned earlier that it is desirable that operating cash flows are sufficient to cover  capital expenditures  The excess of operating cash flow over capital expenditures is known  generically as free cash flow  For purposes of valuing a company or its equity securities an  analyst may want to determine and use other cash flow measures such as free cash flow to the  firm  FCFF  or free cash flow to equity  FCFE  
9,287,FCFF is the cash flow available to the company s suppliers of debt and equity capital after all  operating expenses  including income taxes  have been paid and necessary investments in  working capital and fixed capital have been made  FCFF can be computed starting with net  income as
10,287,FCFF   NI   NCC   Int     Tax rate    FCInv   WCInv
11,287,where
12,287,NI   Net income

2,288,The reason for adding back interest is that FCFF is the cash flow available to the suppliers of  debt capital as well as equity capital  Conveniently FCFF can also be computed from cash flow  from operating activities as
3,288,FCFF   CFO   Int     Tax rate    FCInv
4,288,CFO represents cash flow from operating activities under US GAAP or under IFRS where the  company has included interest paid in operating activities  If interest paid was included in  financing activities then CFO does not have to be adjusted for Int     Tax rate   Under IFRS if  the company has placed interest and dividends received in investing activities these should be  added back to CFO to determine FCFF  Additionally if dividends paid were subtracted in the  operating section these should be added back in to compute FCFF 
5,288,The computation of FCFF for Acme Corporation  based on the data from Exhibits     and     is as follows

11,288,FCFE is the cash flow available to the company s common stockholders after all operating  expenses and borrowing costs  principal and interest  have been paid and necessary investments  in working capital and fixed capital have been made  FCFE can be computed as
12,288,FCFE   CFO   FCInv   Net borrowing
13,288,When net borrowing is negative debt repayments exceed receipts of borrowed funds  In this  case FCFE can be expressed as
14,288,FCFE   CFO   FCInv   Net debt repayment
15,288,The computation of FCFE for Acme Corporation  based on the data from Exhibits     and     is as follows

17,288,                       
18,288,Positive FCFE means that the company has an excess of operating cash flow over amounts  needed for capital expenditures and repayment of debt  This cash would be available for  distribution to owners

2,291,Solution 
3,291,On both measures operating cash flow divided by revenue and operating cash flow  divided by assets Apple s performance was much stronger than the two comparable  companies  Dell s operating cash flow divided by revenue is lower than HP s for all  three years  Dell s operating cash flow relative to assets is similar to HP s in       lower than HP s in      and higher than HP s in       Apple s measures are  significantly higher than the others indicating that it has the best cash generating ability   Note that Apple s cash generating ability presumably reflects the company s successful  introduction and sales of new products  including the iPhone  tightly managed  inventory and ability to generate revenues  and operating cash flow  from businesses  not requiring significant investment in such assets as service contracts and sales of third  party compatible products  Overall Potter should undertake additional research to  understand the underlying business reasons for the differences in the companies  cash  flow profiles 
4,291,SUMMARY
5,291,The cash flow statement provides important information about a company s cash receipts and  cash payments during an accounting period as well as information about a company s operating  investing and financing activities  Although the income statement provides a measure of a  company s success cash and cash flow are also vital to a company s long term success   Information on the sources and uses of cash helps creditors investors and other statement users  evaluate the company s liquidity solvency and financial flexibility  Key concepts are as  follows 
6,291,  Cash flow activities are classified into three categories  operating activities investing  activities and financing activities  Significant non cash transaction activities  if present   are reported by using a supplemental disclosure note to the cash flow statement 
7,291,  Cash flow statements under IFRS and US GAAP are similar  however IFRS provide  companies with more choices in classifying some cash flow items as operating investing  or financing activities 
8,291,  Companies can use either the direct or the indirect method for reporting their operating  cash flow 
9,291,  The direct method discloses operating cash inflows by source  e g  cash received  from customers cash received from investment income  and operating cash  outflows by use  e g  cash paid to suppliers cash paid for interest  in the operating  activities section of the cash flow statement 
10,291,  The indirect method reconciles net income to operating cash flow by adjusting net  income for all non cash items and the net changes in the operating working capital  accounts

2,292,  The cash flow statement is linked to a company s income statement and comparative  balance sheets and to data on those statements 
3,292,  Although the indirect method is most commonly used by companies an analyst can  generally convert it to an approximation of the direct format by following a simple three  step process 
4,292,  An evaluation of a cash flow statement should involve an assessment of the sources and  uses of cash and the main drivers of cash flow within each category of activities 
5,292,  The analyst can use common size statement analysis for the cash flow statement  Two  approaches to developing the common size statements are the total cash inflows total  cash outflows method and the percentage of net revenues method 
6,292,  The cash flow statement can be used to determine free cash flow to the firm  FCFF  and  free cash flow to equity  FCFE  
7,292,  The cash flow statement may also be used in financial ratios that measure a company s  profitability performance and financial strength

6,299,B  This ratio is an effective tax ratio measuring the amount of a company s operating  cash flow used for taxes and indicating a company s efficiency in tax management 
7,299,C  This ratio is an operating profitability ratio measuring the operating cash flow  generated accounting for taxes and interest and indicating a company s liquidity 
8,299,SOLUTIONS
9,299,   B is correct  Operating investing and financing are the three major classifications of  activities in a cash flow statement  Revenues expenses and net income are elements of  the income statement  Inflows outflows and net flows are items of information in the  statement of cash flows 
10,299,   B is correct  Purchases and sales of long term assets are considered investing activities   Note that if the transaction had involved the exchange of a building for other than cash   for example for another building common stock of another company or a long term  note receivable  it would have been considered a significant non cash activity 
11,299,   B is correct  The purchase and sale of securities considered cash equivalents and  securities held for trading are considered operating activities even for companies in which  this activity is not a primary business activity 
12,299,   C is correct  Payment of dividends is a financing activity under US GAAP  Payment of  interest and receipt of dividends are included in operating cash flows under US GAAP   Note that IFRS allow companies to include receipt of interest and dividends as either  operating or investing cash flows and to include payment of interest and dividends as  either operating or financing cash flows 
13,299,   C is correct  Non cash transactions if significant are reported as supplementary  information not in the investing or financing sections of the cash flow statement 
14,299,   C is correct  Because no cash is involved in non cash transactions these transactions are  not incorporated in the cash flow statement  However non cash transactions that  significantly affect capital or asset structures are required to be disclosed either in a  separate note or a supplementary schedule to the cash flow statement

2,300,   C is correct  Interest expense is always classified as an operating cash flow under US  GAAP but may be classified as either an operating or financing cash flow under IFRS 
3,300,   C is correct  Taxes on income are required to be separately disclosed under IFRS and US  GAAP  The disclosure may be in the cash flow statement or elsewhere 
4,300,   A is correct  The operating section may be prepared under the indirect method  The other  sections are always prepared under the direct method 
5,300,    A is correct  Under the indirect method the operating section would begin with net  income and adjust it to arrive at operating cash flow  The other two items would appear in  the operating section under the direct method 
6,300,    C is correct  The primary argument in favor of the direct method is that it provides  information on the specific sources of operating cash receipts and payments  Arguments  for the indirect method include that it mirrors a forecasting approach and it is easier and  less costly
7,300,    C is correct  The amount of cash collected from customers during the quarter is equal to  beginning accounts receivable plus revenues minus ending accounts receivable       million       million       million       million  A reduction in accounts receivable  indicates that cash collected during the quarter was greater than revenue on an accrual  basis 
8,300,    B is correct  An addition to net income is made when there is a loss on the retirement of  debt which is a non operating loss  A gain on the sale of an asset and a decrease in  deferred tax liability are both subtracted from net income 
9,300,    A is correct  Revenues of      million minus the increase in accounts receivable of      million equal     million cash received from customers  The increase in accounts  receivable means that the company received less in cash than it reported as revenue 
10,300,    A is correct 
11,300,Operating cash flows   Cash received from customers    Cash paid to suppliers   Cash  paid to employees   Cash paid for other operating expenses   Cash paid for interest    Cash paid for income taxes 
12,300,Cash received from customers   Revenue   Decrease in accounts receivable
13,300,                          million
14,300,Cash paid to suppliers   Cost of goods sold   Decrease in inventory   Increase in  accounts payable
15,300,                                        million
16,300,Therefore the company s operating cash flow               Cash paid for salaries    Cash paid for interest   Cash paid for taxes                                 million 
17,300,    C is correct  Cost of goods sold of     million plus the increase in inventory of    million  equals purchases from suppliers of     million  The increase in accounts payable of     million means that the company paid     million in cash      million minus    million   to its suppliers

2,301,    A is correct  Cost of goods sold of     million less the decrease in inventory of     million equals purchases from suppliers of     million  The increase in accounts payable  of    million means that the company paid     million in cash      million minus     million  
3,301,    C is correct  Beginning salaries payable of    million plus salaries expense of     million  minus ending salaries payable of    million equals     million  Alternatively the  expense of     million plus the    million decrease in salaries payable equals      million 
4,301,    C is correct  Cash received from customers   Sales   Decrease in accounts receivable                         Cash paid to suppliers   Cost of goods sold   Increase in inventory    Increase in accounts payable                             
5,301,    C is correct  Interest expense of     million less the increase in interest payable of     million equals interest paid of     million  Tax expense of    million plus the decrease in  taxes payable of    million equals taxes paid of     million 
6,301,    B is correct  All dollar amounts are in millions  Net income  NI  for      is      This  amount is the increase in retained earnings     plus the dividends paid       Depreciation of     is added back to net income and the increases in accounts  receivable    and in inventory    are subtracted from net income because they are uses  of cash  The decrease in accounts payable is also a use of cash and therefore a  subtraction from net income  Thus cash flow from operations is                                       
7,301,    A is correct  Selling price  cash inflow  minus book value equals gain or loss on sale   therefore gain or loss on sale plus book value equals selling price  cash inflow   The  amount of loss is given    million  To calculate the book value of the equipment sold  find the historical cost of the equipment and the accumulated depreciation on the  equipment 
8,301,  Beginning balance of equipment of      million plus equipment purchased of      million minus ending balance of equipment of      million equals the historical  cost of equipment sold or    million 
9,301,  Beginning accumulated depreciation of     million plus depreciation expense for  the year of    million minus ending balance of accumulated depreciation of      million equals accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold or    million 
10,301,  Therefore the book value of the equipment sold was    million minus    million  or    million 
11,301,  Because the loss on the sale of equipment was    million the amount of cash  received must have been    million 
12,301,    A is correct  The increase of     million in common stock and additional paid in capital  indicates that the company issued stock during the year  The increase in retained earnings  of     million indicates that the company paid     million in cash dividends during the  year determined as beginning retained earnings of      million plus net income of      million minus ending retained earnings of      million which equals     million in cash  dividends

2,302,    B is correct  To derive operating cash flow the company would make the following  adjustments to net income  Add depreciation  a non cash expense  of    million  add the  decrease in accounts receivable of    million  add the increase in accounts payable of     million  and subtract the increase in inventory of    million  Total additions would be      million and total subtractions would be    million which gives net additions of     million 
3,302,    C is correct  An overall assessment of the major sources and uses of cash should be the  first step in evaluating a cash flow statement 
4,302,    B is correct  The primary source of cash is operating activities  The primary use of cash is  investing activities  Interest received for Telef nica is classified as an investing activity 
5,302,    A is correct  The amount of cash paid to suppliers is calculated as follows 
6,302,  Cost of goods sold   Decrease in inventory   Increase in accounts payable
7,302,                       
8,302,         
9,302,    B is correct  An appropriate method to prepare a common size cash flow statement is to  show each line item on the cash flow statement as a percentage of net revenue  An  alternative way to prepare a statement of cash flows is to show each item of cash inflow  as a percentage of total inflows and each item of cash outflows as a percentage of total  outflows 
10,302,    B is correct  Free cash flow to the firm can be computed as operating cash flows plus  after tax interest expense less capital expenditures 
11,302,    A is correct  This ratio is an interest coverage ratio measuring a company s ability to  meet its interest obligations and indicating a company s solvency  This coverage ratio is  based on cash flow information  another common coverage ratio uses a measure based on  the income statement  earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation

18,304,   INTRODUCTION
19,304,Financial analysis tools can be useful in assessing a company s performance and trends in that performance  In  essence an analyst converts data into financial metrics that assist in decision making  Analysts seek to answer  such questions as  How successfully has the company performed relative to its own past performance and  relative to its competitors  How is the company likely to perform in the future  Based on expectations about  future performance what is the value of this company or the securities it issues

2,305,A primary source of data is a company s annual report including the financial statements and notes and  management commentary  operating and financial review or management s discussion and analysis   This  reading focuses on data presented in financial reports prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards   IFRS  and United States generally accepted accounting principles  US GAAP   However financial reports do  not contain all the information needed to perform effective financial analysis  Although financial statements do  contain data about the past performance of a company  its income and cash flows  as well as its current financial  condition  assets liabilities and owners  equity  such statements do not necessarily provide all the information  useful for analysis nor do they forecast future results  The financial analyst must be capable of using financial  statements in conjunction with other information to make projections and reach valid conclusions  Accordingly  an analyst typically needs to supplement the information found in a company s financial reports with other  information including information on the economy industry comparable companies and the company itself 
3,305,This reading describes various techniques used to analyze a company s financial statements  Financial analysis of  a company may be performed for a variety of reasons such as valuing equity securities assessing credit risk  conducting due diligence related to an acquisition or assessing a subsidiary s performance  This reading will  describe techniques common to any financial analysis and then discuss more specific aspects for the two most  common categories  equity analysis and credit analysis 
4,305,Equity analysis incorporates an owner s perspective either for valuation or performance evaluation  Credit  analysis incorporates a creditor s  such as a banker or bondholder  perspective  In either case there is a need to  gather and analyze information to make a decision  ownership or credit   the focus of analysis varies because of  the differing interest of owners and creditors  Both equity and credit analyses assess the entity s ability to  generate and grow earnings and cash flow as well as any associated risks  Equity analysis usually places a  greater emphasis on growth whereas credit analysis usually places a greater emphasis on risks  The difference in  emphasis reflects the different fundamentals of these types of investments  The value of a company s equity  generally increases as the company s earnings and cash flow increase whereas the value of a company s debt has  an upper limit  
5,305,The balance of this reading is organized as follows  Section   recaps the framework for financial statements and  the place of financial analysis techniques within the framework  Section   provides a description of analytical  tools and techniques  Section   explains how to compute analyze and interpret common financial ratios  Sections    through   explain the use of ratios and other analytical data in equity analysis credit analysis segment analysis  and forecasting respectively  A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple  choice format conclude the reading 
6,305,   THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS PROCESS
7,305,In financial analysis it is essential to clearly identify and understand the final objective and the steps required to  reach that objective  In addition the analyst needs to know where to find relevant data how to process and  analyze the data  in other words know the typical questions to address when interpreting data  and how to  communicate the analysis and conclusions 
8,305,     The Objectives of the Financial Analysis Process
9,305,Because of the variety of reasons for performing financial analysis the numerous available techniques and the  often substantial amount of data it is important that the analytical approach be tailored to the specific situation   Prior to beginning any financial analysis the analyst should clarify the purpose and context and clearly  understand the following 
10,305,  What is the purpose of the analysis  What questions will this analysis answer 
11,305,  What level of detail will be needed to accomplish this purpose 
12,305,  What data are available for the analysis 
13,305,  What are the factors or relationships that will influence the analysis

3,306,Having clarified the purpose and context of the analysis the analyst can select the set of techniques  e g  ratios   that will best assist in making a decision  Although there is no single approach to structuring the analysis process  a general framework is set forth in Exhibit     The steps in this process were discussed in more detail in an earlier  reading  the primary focus of this reading is on Phases   and   processing and analyzing data

10,307,     Distinguishing between Computations and Analysis
11,307,An effective analysis encompasses both computations and interpretations  A well reasoned analysis differs from a  mere compilation of various pieces of information computations tables and graphs by integrating the data  collected into a cohesive whole  Analysis of past performance for example should address not only what  happened but also why it happened and whether it advanced the company s strategy  Some of the key questions to  address include 
12,307,  What aspects of performance are critical for this company to successfully compete in this industry 
13,307,  How well did the company s performance meet these critical aspects   Established through computation  and comparison with appropriate benchmarks such as the company s own historical performance or  competitors  performance  
14,307,  What were the key causes of this performance and how does this performance reflect the company s  strategy   Established through analysis  
15,307,If the analysis is forward looking additional questions include 
16,307,  What is the likely impact of an event or trend   Established through interpretation of analysis  
17,307,  What is the likely response of management to this trend   Established through evaluation of quality of  management and corporate governance  
18,307,  What is the likely impact of trends in the company industry and economy on future cash flows    Established through assessment of corporate strategy and through forecasts  
19,307,  What are the recommendations of the analyst   Established through interpretation and forecasting of results  of analysis  
20,307,  What risks should be highlighted   Established by an evaluation of major uncertainties in the forecast and  in the environment within which the company operates  
21,307,Example   demonstrates how a company s financial data can be analyzed in the context of its business strategy  and changes in that strategy  An analyst must be able to understand the  why  behind the numbers and ratios not  just what the numbers and ratios are

12,308,Apple reported a    percent increase in net sales from FY     to FY     and a further increase in  FY     of approximately    percent  Gross margin increased    percent from FY     to FY     and  increased    percent from FY     to FY      From FY     to FY     the gross margin more than  doubled  Also the company s operating income almost tripled over the three year period  From FY      to      Dell reported a decrease in sales gross margin and operating income
13,308,What caused Apple s dramatic growth in sales and operating income and Dell s comparatively sluggish  performance  One of the most important factors was the introduction of innovative and stylish products  the linkages with iTunes and expansion of the distinctive Apple stores  Among the company s most  important and most successful new products was the iPhone  Apple s         K indicates that iPhone unit  sales grew    percent from      million units in      to      million units in       By      the  company s revenues from iPhones and related services had grown to       billion and were nearly as  large as the company s       billion revenues from sales of Mac computers  The new products and  linkages among the products not only increased demand but also increased the potential for higher pricing   As a result gross profit margins and operating profit margins increased over the period because costs did  not increase at the same pace as sales  Moreover the company s products revolutionized the delivery  channel for music and video  The financial results reflect a successful execution of the company s strategy  to deliver integrated innovative products by controlling the design and development of both hardware and  software 
14,308,Dell continued to concentrate in the personal computer market which arguably is in the market maturity  stage of the product life cycle  Dell s results are consistent with a market maturity stage where industry  sales level off and competition increases so that industry profits decline  With increased competition  some companies cannot compete and drop out of the market

2,309,Analysts often need to communicate the findings of their analysis in a written report  Their reports should  communicate how conclusions were reached and why recommendations were made  For example a report might  present the following 
3,309,  the purpose of the report unless it is readily apparent 
4,309,  relevant aspects of the business context 
5,309,  economic environment  country region macro economy sector  
6,309,  financial and other infrastructure  accounting auditing rating agencies  
7,309,  legal and regulatory environment  and any other material limitations on the company being  analyzed  
8,309,  evaluation of corporate governance and assessment of management strategy including the company s  competitive advantage s  
9,309,  assessment of financial and operational data including key assumptions in the analysis  and
10,309,  conclusions and recommendations including limitations of the analysis and risks 
11,309,An effective narrative and well supported conclusions and recommendations are normally enhanced by using       years of data as well as analytic techniques appropriate to the purpose of the report 
12,309,   ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
13,309,The tools and techniques presented in this section facilitate evaluations of company data  Evaluations require  comparisons  It is difficult to say that a company s financial performance was  good  without clarifying the basis  for comparison  In assessing a company s ability to generate and grow earnings and cash flow and the risks  related to those earnings and cash flows the analyst draws comparisons to other companies  cross sectional  analysis  and over time  trend or time series analysis  
14,309,For example an analyst may wish to compare the profitability of companies competing in a global industry  If the  companies differ significantly in size and or report their financial data in different currencies comparing net  income as reported is not useful  Ratios  which express one number in relation to another  and common size  financial statements can remove size as a factor and enable a more relevant comparison  To achieve comparability  across companies reporting in different currencies one approach is to translate all reported numbers into a  common currency using exchange rates at the end of a period  Others may prefer to translate reported numbers  using the average exchange rates during the period  Alternatively if the focus is primarily on ratios  comparability can be achieved without translating the currencies 
15,309,The analyst may also want to examine comparable performance over time  Again the nominal currency amounts  of sales or net income may not highlight significant changes  However using ratios  see Example    horizontal  financial statements where quantities are stated in terms of a selected base year value and graphs can make such  changes more apparent  Another obstacle to comparison is differences in fiscal year end  To achieve  comparability one approach is to develop trailing twelve months data which will be described in a section below   Finally it should be noted that differences in accounting standards can limit comparability

2,310,Ratio Analysis
3,310,An analyst is examining the profitability of three Asian companies with large shares of the global personal  computer market  Acer Inc  Lenovo Group Limited and Toshiba Corporation  Acer has pursued a  strategy of selling its products at affordable prices  In contrast Lenovo aims to achieve higher selling  prices by stressing the high engineering quality of its personal computers for business use  Toshiba is a  conglomerate with varied product lines in addition to computers  For its personal computer business one  aspect of Toshiba s strategy has been to focus on laptops only in contrast with other manufacturers that  also make desktops  Acer reports in New Taiwan dollars  TW   Lenovo reports in US dollars  US   and  Toshiba reports in Japanese yen  JP    For Acer fiscal year end is    December  For both Lenovo and  Toshiba fiscal year end is    March  thus for these companies FY     ended    March      
4,310,The analyst collects the data shown in Exhibit   below  Use this information to answer the following  questions 
5,310,   Which of the three companies is largest based on the amount of revenue in US  reported in fiscal  year       For FY     assume the relevant average exchange rates were      TW  US  and       JP  US

4,311,Note  Comparing the size of companies reporting in different currencies requires translating reported  numbers into a common currency using exchange rates at some point in time  This solution converts the  revenues of Acer and Toshiba to billions of US dollars using the average exchange rate of the fiscal  period  It would be equally informative  and would yield the same conclusion  to convert the revenues of  Acer and Lenovo to Japanese yen or to convert the revenues of Toshiba and Lenovo to New Taiwan  dollars

10,311,The table shows two growth metrics  Calculations are illustrated using the revenue data for Acer 
11,311,The change in Acer s revenue for FY     versus FY     is      percent calculated as                             or equivalently                       
12,311,The compound annual growth rate in Acer s revenue from FY     to FY     is      percent calculated  using a financial calculator with the following inputs  Present Value             Future value            N      Payment      and then Interest     to solve for growth 
13,311,Calculation of the compound annual growth rate can also be expressed as follows    Ending value    Beginning value    number of periods                                             or      percent 
14,311,Solution to   
15,311,Profitability can be assessed by comparing the amount of gross profit to revenue and the amount of net  income to revenue  The following table presents these two profitability ratios gross profit margin  gross profit divided by revenue  and net profit margin  net income divided by revenue  for each year

22,311,The net profit margins indicate that Acer has been the most profitable of the three companies  The  company s net profit margin was somewhat lower in the most recent two years  only     percent and      percent in FY     and FY     respectively compared to     percent     percent and     percent in FYs            and      respectively  but has nonetheless remained positive and has remained higher than  the competing companies

2,312,Acer s gross profit margin has remained consistently above    percent in all   fiscal years  In contrast  Lenovo s gross profit margin has declined markedly over the   year period but remains higher than  Acer s which is consistent with the company s strategic objective to achieve higher selling prices by  stressing the high engineering quality of its personal computers  However Lenovo s net profit margin has  typically been lower than Acer s  Further analysis is needed to determine the cause of Lenovo s gross  profitability decline over the period FY     to       lower selling prices and or higher costs  to assess  whether this decline is likely to persist in future years and to determine the reason Lenovo s net profit  margins are generally lower than Acer s despite Lenovo s higher gross profit margins 
3,312,Because Toshiba is a conglomerate profit ratios based on data for the entire company give limited  information about the company s personal computer business  Ratios based on segment data would likely  be more useful than profit ratios for the entire company  Based on the aggregate information Toshiba s  gross profit margins are higher than either Acer s or Lenovo s gross profit margins whereas Toshiba s net  profit margins are generally lower than the net profit margins of either of the other two companies 
4,312,Section     describes the tools and techniques of ratio analysis in more detail  Sections     to     describe other  tools and techniques 
5,312,     Ratios
6,312,There are many relationships between financial accounts and between expected relationships from one point in  time to another  Ratios are a useful way of expressing these relationships  Ratios express one quantity in relation  to another  usually as a quotient  
7,312,Extensive academic research has examined the importance of ratios in predicting stock returns  Ou and Penman        Abarbanell and Bushee       or credit failure  Altman       Ohlson       Hopwood et al          This research has found that financial statement ratios are effective in selecting investments and in predicting  financial distress  Practitioners routinely use ratios to derive and communicate the value of companies and  securities 
8,312,Several aspects of ratio analysis are important to understand  First the computed ratio is not  the answer   The  ratio is an indicator of some aspect of a company s performance telling what happened but not why it happened   For example an analyst might want to answer the question  Which of two companies was more profitable  As  demonstrated in the previous example the net profit margin which expresses profit relative to revenue can  provide insight into this question  Net profit margin is calculated by dividing net income by revenue  
9,312,Net income Revenue
10,312,Assume Company A has         of net income and Company B has         of net income  Company B  generated twice as much income as Company A but was it more profitable  Assume further that Company A has           of revenue and thus a net profit margin of   percent and Company B has          of revenue and  thus a net profit margin of      percent  Expressing net income as a percentage of revenue clarifies the  relationship  For each      of revenue Company A earns    in net income whereas Company B earns only        for each      of revenue  So we can now answer the question of which company was more profitable in  percentage terms  Company A was more profitable as indicated by its higher net profit margin of   percent  Note  that Company A was more profitable despite the fact that Company B reported higher absolute amounts of net  income and revenue  However this ratio by itself does not tell us why Company A has a higher profit margin   Further analysis is required to determine the reason  perhaps higher relative sales prices or better cost control or  lower effective tax rates  
11,312,Company size sometimes confers economies of scale so the absolute amounts of net income and revenue are  useful in financial analysis  However ratios reduce the effect of size which enhances comparisons between  companies and over time

2,313,A second important aspect of ratio analysis is that differences in accounting policies  across companies and across  time  can distort ratios and a meaningful comparison may therefore involve adjustments to the financial data   Third not all ratios are necessarily relevant to a particular analysis  The ability to select a relevant ratio or ratios  to answer the research question is an analytical skill  Finally as with financial analysis in general ratio analysis  does not stop with computation  interpretation of the result is essential  In practice differences in ratios across  time and across companies can be subtle and interpretation is situation specific 
3,313,       The Universe of Ratios
4,313,There are no authoritative bodies specifying exact formulas for computing ratios or providing a standard  comprehensive list of ratios  Formulas and even names of ratios often differ from analyst to analyst or from  database to database  The number of different ratios that can be created is practically limitless  There are  however widely accepted ratios that have been found to be useful  Section   of this reading will focus primarily  on these broad classes and commonly accepted definitions of key ratios  However the analyst should be aware  that different ratios may be used in practice and that certain industries have unique ratios tailored to the  characteristics of that industry  When faced with an unfamiliar ratio the analyst can examine the underlying  formula to gain insight into what the ratio is measuring  For example consider the following ratio formula 
5,313,Operating income Average total assets
6,313,Never having seen this ratio an analyst might question whether a result of    percent is better than   percent  The  answer can be found in the ratio itself  The numerator is operating income and the denominator is average total  assets so the ratio can be interpreted as the amount of operating income generated per unit of assets  For every       of average total assets generating     of operating income is better than generating    of operating income   Furthermore it is apparent that this particular ratio is an indicator of profitability  and to a lesser extent  efficiency in use of assets in generating operating profits   When facing a ratio for the first time the analyst  should evaluate the numerator and denominator to assess what the ratio is attempting to measure and how it  should be interpreted  This is demonstrated in Example   
7,313,EXAMPLE  
8,313,Interpreting a Financial Ratio
9,313,A US insurance company reports that its  combined ratio  is determined by dividing losses and expenses  incurred by net premiums earned  It reports the following combined ratios 
10,313,Fiscal Year           Combined ratio                                 
11,313,Explain what this ratio is measuring and compare the results reported for each of the years shown in the  chart  What other information might an analyst want to review before making any conclusions on this  information 
12,313,Solution 
13,313,The combined ratio is a profitability measure  The ratio is explaining how much costs  losses and  expenses  were incurred for every dollar of revenue  net premiums earned   The underlying formula  indicates that a lower ratio is better  The Year   ratio of      percent means that for every dollar of net  premiums earned the costs were        yielding a gross profit of         Ratios greater than     percent  indicate an overall loss  A review of the data indicates that there does not seem to be a consistent trend in  this ratio  Profits were achieved in Years   and    The results for Years   and   show the most significant  costs at approximately     percent 
14,313,The analyst would want to discuss this data further with management and understand the characteristics of  the underlying business  He or she would want to understand why the results are so volatile  The analyst  would also want to determine what should be used as a benchmark for this ratio

2,314,The Operating income Average total assets ratio shown above is one of many versions of the return on assets   ROA  ratio  Note that there are other ways of specifying this formula based on how assets are defined  Some  financial ratio databases compute ROA using the ending value of assets rather than average assets  In limited  cases one may also see beginning assets in the denominator  Which one is right  It depends on what you are  trying to measure and the underlying company trends  If the company has a stable level of assets the answer will  not differ greatly under the three measures of assets  beginning average and ending   However if the assets are  growing  or shrinking  the results will differ among the three measures  When assets are growing operating  income divided by ending assets may not make sense because some of the income would have been generated  before some assets were purchased and this would understate the company s performance  Similarly if  beginning assets are used some of the operating income later in the year may have been generated only because  of the addition of assets  therefore the ratio would overstate the company s performance  Because operating  income occurs throughout the period it generally makes sense to use some average measure of assets  A good  general rule is that when an income statement or cash flow statement number is in the numerator of a ratio and a  balance sheet number is in the denominator then an average should be used for the denominator  It is generally  not necessary to use averages when only balance sheet numbers are used in both the numerator and denominator  because both are determined as of the same date  However in some instances even ratios that only use balance  sheet data may use averages  For example return on equity  ROE  which is defined as net income divided by  average shareholders  equity can be decomposed into other ratios some of which only use balance sheet data  In  decomposing ROE into component ratios if an average is used in one of the component ratios then it should be  used in the other component ratios  The decomposition of ROE is discussed further in Section       
3,314,If an average is used judgment is also required about what average should be used  For simplicity most ratio  databases use a simple average of the beginning and end of year balance sheet amounts  If the company s  business is seasonal so that levels of assets vary by interim period  semiannual or quarterly  then it may be  beneficial to take an average over all interim periods if available   If the analyst is working within a company and  has access to monthly data this can also be used  
4,314,       Value Purposes and Limitations of Ratio Analysis
5,314,The value of ratio analysis is that it enables a financial analyst to evaluate past performance assess the current  financial position of the company and gain insights useful for projecting future results  As noted previously the  ratio itself is not  the answer  but is an indicator of some aspect of a company s performance  Financial ratios  provide insights into 
6,314,  microeconomic relationships within a company that help analysts project earnings and free cash flow 
7,314,  a company s financial flexibility or ability to obtain the cash required to grow and meet its obligations  even if unexpected circumstances develop 
8,314,  management s ability 
9,314,  changes in the company and or industry over time  and
10,314,  comparability with peer companies or the relevant industry ies  
11,314,There are also limitations to ratio analysis  Factors to consider include 
12,314,  The heterogeneity or homogeneity of a company s operating activities  Companies may have divisions  operating in many different industries  This can make it difficult to find comparable industry ratios to use  for comparison purposes 
13,314,  The need to determine whether the results of the ratio analysis are consistent  One set of ratios may  indicate a problem whereas another set may indicate that the potential problem is only short term in nature 
14,314,  The need to use judgment  A key issue is whether a ratio for a company is within a reasonable range   Although financial ratios are used to help assess the growth potential and risk of a company they cannot be  used alone to directly value a company or its securities or to determine its creditworthiness  The entire  operation of the company must be examined and the external economic and industry setting in which it is  operating must be considered when interpreting financial ratios

2,315,  The use of alternative accounting methods  Companies frequently have latitude when choosing certain  accounting methods  Ratios taken from financial statements that employ different accounting choices may  not be comparable unless adjustments are made  Some important accounting considerations include the  following 
3,315,  FIFO  first in first out  LIFO  last in first out  or average cost inventory valuation methods  IFRS  does not allow LIFO  
4,315,  Cost or equity methods of accounting for unconsolidated affiliates 
5,315,  Straight line or accelerated methods of depreciation  and
6,315,  Capital or operating lease treatment 
7,315,The expanding use of IFRS and the convergence efforts between IFRS and US GAAP has sought to make the  financial statements of different companies more comparable and may overcome some of these difficulties   Nonetheless there will remain accounting choices that the analyst must consider 
8,315,       Sources of Ratios
9,315,Ratios may be computed using data obtained directly from companies  financial statements or from a database  such as Bloomberg Compustat FactSet or Thomson Reuters  The information provided by the database may  include information as reported in companies  financial statements and ratios calculated based on the information   These databases are popular because they provide easy access to many years of historical data so that trends over  time can be examined  They also allow for ratio calculations based on periods other than the company s fiscal  year such as for the trailing    months  TTM  or most recent quarter  MRQ  
10,315,EXAMPLE  
11,315,Trailing Twelve Months
12,315,On    July an analyst is examining a company with a fiscal year ending on    December  Use the  following data to calculate the company s trailing    month earnings  for the period ended    June       
13,315,  Earnings for the year ended    December             
14,315,  Earnings for the six months ended    June             and
15,315,  Earnings for the six months ended    June            
16,315,Solution

18,315,Analysts should be aware that the underlying formulas for ratios may differ by vendor  The formula used should  be obtained from the vendor and the analyst should determine whether any adjustments are necessary   Furthermore database providers often exercise judgment when classifying items  For example operating income  may not appear directly on a company s income statement and the vendor may use judgment to classify income  statement items as  operating  or  non operating   Variation in such judgments would affect any computation  involving operating income  It is therefore a good practice to use the same source for data when comparing  different companies or when evaluating the historical record of a single company  Analysts should verify the  consistency of formulas and data classifications by the data source  Analysts should also be mindful of the  judgments made by a vendor in data classifications and refer back to the source financial statements until they are  comfortable that the classifications are appropriate

2,316,Systems are under development that collect financial data from regulatory filings and can automatically compute  ratios  The eXtensible Business Reporting Language  XBRL  is a mechanism that attaches  smart tags  to  financial information  e g  total assets  so that software can automatically collect the data and perform desired  computations  The organization developing XBRL  www xbrl org  is an international nonprofit consortium of  over     members from companies associations and agencies including the International Accounting Standards  Board  Many stock exchanges and regulatory agencies around the world now use XBRL for receiving and  distributing public financial reports from listed companies 
3,316,Analysts can compare a subject company to similar  peer  companies in these databases or use aggregate industry  data  For non public companies aggregate industry data can be obtained from such sources as Annual Statement  Studies by the Risk Management Association or Dun   Bradstreet  These publications typically provide industry  data with companies sorted into quartiles  By definition twenty five percent of companies  ratios fall within the  lowest quartile    percent have ratios between the lower quartile and median value and so on  Analysts can then  determine a company s relative standing in the industry 
4,316,     Common Size Analysis
5,316,Common size analysis involves expressing financial data including entire financial statements in relation to a  single financial statement item or base  Items used most frequently as the bases are total assets or revenue  In  essence common size analysis creates a ratio between every financial statement item and the base item 
6,316,Common size analysis was demonstrated in readings for the income statement balance sheet and cash flow  statement  In this section we present common size analysis of financial statements in greater detail and include  further discussion of their interpretation 
7,316,       Common Size Analysis of the Balance Sheet
8,316,A vertical  common size balance sheet prepared by dividing each item on the balance sheet by the same period s  total assets and expressing the results as percentages highlights the composition of the balance sheet  What is the  mix of assets being used  How is the company financing itself  How does one company s balance sheet  composition compare with that of peer companies and what are the reasons for any differences 
9,316,A horizontal common size balance sheet prepared by computing the increase or decrease in percentage terms of  each balance sheet item from the prior year or prepared by dividing the quantity of each item by a base year  quantity of the item highlights changes in items  These changes can be compared to expectations  The section on  trend analysis below will illustrate a horizontal common size balance sheet 
10,316,Exhibit   presents a vertical common size  partial  balance sheet for a hypothetical company in two time periods   In this example receivables have increased from    percent to    percent of total assets and the ratio has  increased by    percent from Period   to Period    What are possible reasons for such an increase  The increase  might indicate that the company is making more of its sales on a credit basis rather than a cash basis perhaps in  response to some action taken by a competitor  Alternatively the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets  may have occurred because of a change in another current asset category for example a decrease in the level of  inventory  the analyst would then need to investigate why that asset category has changed  Another possible  reason for the increase in receivables as a percentage of assets is that the company has lowered its credit  standards relaxed its collection procedures or adopted more aggressive revenue recognition policies  The analyst  can turn to other comparisons and ratios  e g  comparing the rate of growth in accounts receivable with the rate of  growth in sales  to help determine which explanation is most likely

5,317,       Common Size Analysis of the Income Statement
6,317,A vertical common size income statement divides each income statement item by revenue or sometimes by total  assets  especially in the case of financial institutions   If there are multiple revenue sources a decomposition of  revenue in percentage terms is useful  Exhibit   presents a hypothetical company s vertical common size income  statement in two time periods  Revenue is separated into the company s four services each shown as a percentage  of total revenue 
7,317,In this example revenues from Service A have become a far greater percentage of the company s total revenue      percent in Period   and    percent in Period     What are possible reasons for and implications of this change  in business mix  Did the company make a strategic decision to sell more of Service A perhaps because it is more  profitable  Apparently not because the company s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation   EBITDA  declined from    percent of sales to    percent so other possible explanations should be examined  In  addition we note from the composition of operating expenses that the main reason for this decline in profitability  is that salaries and employee benefits have increased from    percent to    percent of total revenue  Are more  highly compensated employees required for Service A  Were higher training costs incurred in order to increase  revenues from Service A  If the analyst wants to predict future performance the causes of these changes must be  understood 
8,317,In addition Exhibit   shows that the company s income tax as a percentage of sales has declined dramatically   from    percent to   percent   Furthermore taxes as a percentage of earnings before tax  EBT   the effective tax  rate which is usually the more relevant comparison  have decreased from    percent           to    percent            Is Service A which in Period   is a greater percentage of total revenue provided in a jurisdiction with  lower tax rates  If not what is the explanation for the change in effective tax rate 
9,317,The observations based on Exhibit   summarize the issues that can be raised through analysis of the vertical  common size income statement

6,318,       Cross Sectional Analysis
7,318,As noted previously ratios and common size statements derive part of their meaning through comparison to some  benchmark  Cross sectional analysis  sometimes called  relative analysis   compares a specific metric for one  company with the same metric for another company or group of companies allowing comparisons even though  the companies might be of significantly different sizes and or operate in different currencies  This is illustrated in  Exhibit

11,318,Company   Percent of Total Assets                 
12,318,Exhibit   presents a vertical common size  partial  balance sheet for two hypothetical companies at the same  point in time  Company   is clearly more liquid  liquidity is a function of how quickly assets can be converted  into cash  than Company   which has only    percent of assets available as cash compared with the highly  liquid Company   which has    percent of assets available as cash  Given that cash is generally a relatively low  yielding asset and thus not a particularly efficient use of excess funds why does Company   hold such a large  percentage of total assets in cash  Perhaps the company is preparing for an acquisition or maintains a large cash  position as insulation from a particularly volatile operating environment  Another issue highlighted by the  comparison in this example is the relatively high percentage of receivables in Company   s assets which may  indicate a greater proportion of credit sales overall changes in asset composition lower credit or collection  standards or aggressive accounting policies 
13,318,       Trend Analysis 
14,318,When looking at financial statements and ratios trends in the data whether they are improving or deteriorating  are as important as the current absolute or relative levels  Trend analysis provides important information  regarding historical performance and growth and given a sufficiently long history of accurate seasonal  information can be of great assistance as a planning and forecasting tool for management and analysts

2,319,Exhibit  A presents a partial balance sheet for a hypothetical company over five periods  The last two columns of  the table show the changes for Period   compared with Period   expressed both in absolute currency  in this case  dollars  and in percentages  A small percentage change could hide a significant currency change and vice versa  prompting the analyst to investigate the reasons despite one of the changes being relatively small  In this example  the largest percentage change was in investments which decreased by      percent   However an examination of  the absolute currency amount of changes shows that investments changed by only    million and the more  significant change was the     million increase in receivables 
3,319,Another way to present data covering a period of time is to show each item in relation to the same item in a base  year  i e  a horizontal common size balance sheet   Exhibits  B and  C illustrate alternative presentations of  horizontal common size balance sheets  Exhibit  B presents the information from the same partial balance sheet  as in Exhibit  A but indexes each item relative to the same item in Period    For example in Period   the  company had     million cash which is    percent or      of the amount of cash it had in Period    Expressed as  an index relative to Period   where each item in Period   is given a value of      the value in Period   would be                         In Period   the company had     million cash which is    percent of the amount of cash  it had in Period                    
4,319,Exhibit  C presents the percentage change in each item relative to the previous year  For example the change in  cash from Period   to Period   was       percent                        and the change in cash from Period   to  Period   was      percent                         An analyst will select the horizontal common size balance that  addresses the particular period of interest  Exhibit  B clearly highlights that in Period   compared to Period   the  company has less than half the amount of cash four times the amount of investments and eight times the amount  of property plant and equipment  Exhibit  C highlights year to year changes  For example cash has declined in  each period  Presenting data this way highlights significant changes  Again note that a mathematically big change  is not necessarily an important change  For example fixed assets increased     percent i e  doubled between  Period   and    however as a proportion of total assets fixed assets increased from   percent of total assets to    percent of total assets  The company s working capital assets  receivables and inventory  are a far higher  proportion of total assets and would likely warrant more attention from an analyst 
5,319,An analysis of horizontal common size balance sheets highlights structural changes that have occurred in a  business  Past trends are obviously not necessarily an accurate predictor of the future especially when the  economic or competitive environment changes  An examination of past trends is more valuable when the  macroeconomic and competitive environments are relatively stable and when the analyst is reviewing a stable or  mature business  However even in less stable contexts historical analysis can serve as a basis for developing  expectations  Understanding of past trends is helpful in assessing whether these trends are likely to continue or if  the trend is likely to change direction

11,320,                                    
12,320,One measure of success is for a company to grow at a rate greater than the rate of the overall market in which it  operates  Companies that grow slowly may find themselves unable to attract equity capital  Conversely  companies that grow too quickly may find that their administrative and management information systems cannot  keep up with the rate of expansion 
13,320,       Relationships among Financial Statements
14,320,Trend data generated by a horizontal common size analysis can be compared across financial statements  For  example the growth rate of assets for the hypothetical company in Exhibit   can be compared with the  company s growth in revenue over the same period of time  If revenue is growing more quickly than assets the  company may be increasing its efficiency  i e  generating more revenue for every dollar invested in assets  
15,320,As another example consider the following year over year percentage changes for a hypothetical company 
16,320,Revenue      Net income      Operating cash flow      Total assets     
17,320,Net income is growing faster than revenue which indicates increasing profitability  However the analyst would  need to determine whether the faster growth in net income resulted from continuing operations or from non  operating non recurring items  In addition the    percent decline in operating cash flow despite increasing  revenue and net income clearly warrants further investigation because it could indicate a problem with earnings  quality  perhaps aggressive reporting of revenue   Lastly the fact that assets have grown faster than revenue  indicates the company s efficiency may be declining  The analyst should examine the composition of the increase  in assets and the reasons for the changes  Example   illustrates a company where comparisons of trend data from  different financial statements were actually indicative of aggressive accounting policies

2,321,EXAMPLE  
3,321,Use of Comparative Growth Information 
4,321,In July      Sunbeam a US company brought in new management to turn the company around  In the  following year      using      as the base the following was observed based on reported numbers 
5,321,Revenue      Inventory      Receivables     
6,321,It is generally more desirable to observe inventory and receivables growing at a slower  or similar  rate  compared to revenue growth  Receivables growing faster than revenue can indicate operational issues  such as lower credit standards or aggressive accounting policies for revenue recognition  Similarly  inventory growing faster than revenue can indicate an operational problem with obsolescence or  aggressive accounting policies such as an improper overstatement of inventory to increase profits 
7,321,In this case the explanation lay in aggressive accounting policies  Sunbeam was later charged by the US  Securities and Exchange Commission with improperly accelerating the recognition of revenue and  engaging in other practices such as billing customers for inventory prior to shipment 
8,321,     The Use of Graphs as an Analytical Tool
9,321,Graphs facilitate comparison of performance and financial structure over time highlighting changes in significant  aspects of business operations  In addition graphs provide the analyst  and management  with a visual overview  of risk trends in a business  Graphs may also be used effectively to communicate the analyst s conclusions  regarding financial condition and risk management aspects 
10,321,Exhibit   presents the information from Exhibit  A in a stacked column format  The graph makes the significant  decline in cash and growth in receivables  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of assets  readily apparent   In Exhibit   the vertical axis shows US  millions and the horizontal axis denotes the period 
11,321,Choosing the appropriate graph to communicate the most significant conclusions of a financial analysis is a skill   In general pie graphs are most useful to communicate the composition of a total value  e g  assets over a limited  amount of time say one or two periods   Line graphs are useful when the focus is on the change in amount for a  limited number of items over a relatively longer time period  When the composition and amounts as well as their  change over time are all important a stacked column graph can be useful

2,323,     Regression Analysis
3,323,When analyzing the trend in a specific line item or ratio frequently it is possible simply to visually evaluate the  changes  For more complex situations regression analysis can help identify relationships  or correlation  between  variables  For example a regression analysis could relate a company s sales to GDP over time providing insight  into whether the company is cyclical  In addition the statistical relationship between sales and GDP could be  used as a basis for forecasting sales 
4,323,Other examples include the relationship between a company s sales and inventory over time or the relationship  between hotel occupancy and a company s hotel revenues  In addition to providing a basis for forecasting  regression analysis facilitates identification of items or ratios that are not behaving as expected given historical  statistical relationships 
5,323,   COMMON RATIOS USED IN FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6,323,In the previous section we focused on ratios resulting from common size analysis  In this section we expand the  discussion to include other commonly used financial ratios and the broad classes into which they are categorized   There is some overlap with common size financial statement ratios  For example a common indicator of  profitability is the net profit margin which is calculated as net income divided by sales  This ratio appears on a  vertical common size income statement  Other ratios involve information from multiple financial statements or  even data from outside the financial statements

2,324,Because of the large number of ratios it is helpful to think about ratios in terms of broad categories based on what  aspects of performance a ratio is intended to detect  Financial analysts and data vendors use a variety of  categories to classify ratios  The category names and the ratios included in each category can differ  Common  ratio categories include activity liquidity solvency profitability and valuation  These categories are summarized  in Exhibit    Each category measures a different aspect of the company s business but all are useful in evaluating  a company s overall ability to generate cash flows from operating its business and the associated risks 
3,324,Exhibit    Categories of Financial Ratios
4,324,Category Activity
5,324,Description
6,324,Liquidity Solvency
7,324,Activity ratios measure how efficiently a company performs day to day tasks such  as the collection of receivables and management of inventory   Liquidity ratios measure the company s ability to meet its short term obligations   Solvency ratios measure a company s ability to meet long term obligations  Subsets  of these ratios are also known as  leverage  and  long term debt  ratios   Profitability Profitability ratios measure the company s ability to generate profits from its  resources  assets    Valuation ratios measure the quantity of an asset or flow  e g  earnings  associated  with ownership of a specified claim  e g  a share or ownership of the enterprise  
8,324,Valuation
9,324,These categories are not mutually exclusive  some ratios are useful in measuring multiple aspects of the business   For example an activity ratio measuring how quickly a company collects accounts receivable is also useful in  assessing the company s liquidity because collection of revenues increases cash  Some profitability ratios also  reflect the operating efficiency of the business  In summary analysts appropriately use certain ratios to evaluate  multiple aspects of the business  Analysts also need to be aware of variations in industry practice in the  calculation of financial ratios  In the text that follows alternative views on ratio calculations are often provided 
10,324,     Interpretation and Context
11,324,Financial ratios can only be interpreted in the context of other information including benchmarks  In general the  financial ratios of a company are compared with those of its major competitors  cross sectional and trend  analysis  and to the company s prior periods  trend analysis   The goal is to understand the underlying causes of  divergence between a company s ratios and those of the industry  Even ratios that remain consistent require  understanding because consistency can sometimes indicate accounting policies selected to smooth earnings  An  analyst should evaluate financial ratios based on the following 
12,324,   Company goals and strategy  Actual ratios can be compared with company objectives to determine whether  objectives are being attained and whether the results are consistent with the company s strategy 
13,324,   Industry norms  cross sectional analysis   A company can be compared with others in its industry by  relating its financial ratios to industry norms or to a subset of the companies in an industry  When industry  norms are used to make judgments care must be taken because 
14,324,  Many ratios are industry specific and not all ratios are important to all industries 
15,324,  Companies may have several different lines of business  This will cause aggregate financial ratios to  be distorted  It is better to examine industry specific ratios by lines of business 
16,324,  Differences in accounting methods used by companies can distort financial ratios 
17,324,  Differences in corporate strategies can affect certain financial ratios 
18,324,   Economic conditions  For cyclical companies financial ratios tend to improve when the economy is strong  and weaken during recessions  Therefore financial ratios should be examined in light of the current phase  of the business cycle

2,325,The following sections discuss activity liquidity solvency and profitability ratios in turn  Selected valuation  ratios are presented later in the section on equity analysis 
3,325,     Activity Ratios
4,325,Activity ratios are also known as asset utilization ratios or operating efficiency ratios  This category is  intended to measure how well a company manages various activities particularly how efficiently it manages its  various assets  Activity ratios are analyzed as indicators of ongoing operational performance how effectively  assets are used by a company  These ratios reflect the efficient management of both working capital and longer  term assets  As noted efficiency has a direct impact on liquidity  the ability of a company to meet its short term  obligations  so some activity ratios are also useful in assessing liquidity

6,325,Exhibit    presents the most commonly used activity ratios  The exhibit shows the numerator and denominator of  each ratio 
7,325,Exhibit     Definitions of Commonly Used Activity Ratios
8,325,Activity Ratios Numerator Denominator Inventory turnover Cost of sales or cost of goods sold Average inventory Days of inventory on hand  DOH  Number of days in period Inventory turnover Receivables turnover Revenue Average receivables Days of sales outstanding  DSO   Number of days in period Receivables turnover Payables turnover Purchases Average trade payables Number of days of payables Number of days in period Payables turnover Working capital turnover Revenue Average working capital Fixed asset turnover Revenue Average net fixed assets Total asset turnover Revenue Average total assets
9,325,Activity ratios measure how efficiently the company utilizes assets  They generally combine information from the  income statement in the numerator with balance sheet items in the denominator  Because the income statement  measures what happened during a period whereas the balance sheet shows the condition only at the end of the  period average balance sheet data are normally used for consistency  For example to measure inventory  management efficiency cost of sales or cost of goods sold  from the income statement  is divided by average  inventory  from the balance sheet   Most databases such as Bloomberg and Baseline use this averaging  convention when income statement and balance sheet data are combined  These databases typically average only  two points  the beginning of the year and the end of the year  The examples that follow based on annual financial  statements illustrate that practice  However some analysts prefer to average more observations if they are  available especially if the business is seasonal  If a semiannual report is prepared an average can be taken over  three data points  beginning middle and end of year   If quarterly data are available a five point average can be  computed  beginning of year and end of each quarterly period  or a four point average using the end of each  quarterly period  Note that if the company s year ends at a low or high point for inventory for the year there can  still be bias in using three or five data points because the beginning and end of year occur at the same time of the  year and are effectively double counted

2,326,Because cost of goods sold measures the cost of inventory that has been sold this ratio measures how many times  per year the entire inventory was theoretically turned over or sold   We say that the entire inventory was   theoretically  sold because in practice companies do not generally sell out their entire inventory   If for  example a company s cost of goods sold for a recent year was         and its average inventory was         the inventory turnover ratio would be     The company theoretically turns over  i e  sells  its entire inventory     times per year  i e  once a month    Again we say  theoretically  because in practice the company likely carries  some inventory from one month into another   Turnover can then be converted to days of inventory on hand   DOH  by dividing inventory turnover into the number of days in the accounting period  In this example the  result is a DOH of                meaning that on average the company s inventory was on hand for about     days or equivalently the company kept on hand about    days  worth of inventory on average during the  period 
3,326,Activity ratios can be computed for any annual or interim period but care must be taken in the interpretation and  comparison across periods  For example if the same company had cost of goods sold for the first quarter      days  of the following year of        and average inventory of        the inventory turnover would be       times  However this turnover rate is      times per quarter which is not directly comparable to the    times per  year in the preceding year  In this case we can annualize the quarterly inventory turnover rate by multiplying the  quarterly turnover by       months   months  or by      using     days    days  for comparison to the annual  turnover rate  So the quarterly inventory turnover is equivalent to a       annual inventory turnover  or       if  we annualize the ratio using a    day quarter and a     day year   To compute the DOH using quarterly data we  can use the quarterly turnover rate and the number of days in the quarter for the numerator or we can use the  annualized turnover rate and     days  either results in DOH of around      with slight differences due to  rounding                  and                     Another time related computational detail is that for  companies using a       week annual period and for leap years the actual days in the year should be used rather  than     
4,326,In some cases an analyst may want to know how many days of inventory are on hand at the end of the year rather  than the average for the year  In this case it would be appropriate to use the year end inventory balance in the  computation rather than the average  If the company is growing rapidly or if costs are increasing rapidly analysts  should consider using cost of goods sold just for the fourth quarter in this computation because the cost of goods  sold of earlier quarters may not be relevant  Example   further demonstrates computation of activity ratios using  Hong Kong Exchange listed Lenovo Group Limited

4,327,       Interpretation of Activity Ratios
5,327,In the following section we further discuss the activity ratios that were defined in Exhibit    
6,327,Inventory Turnover and DOH
7,327,Inventory turnover lies at the heart of operations for many entities  It indicates the resources tied up in inventory   i e  the carrying costs  and can therefore be used to indicate inventory management effectiveness  A higher  inventory turnover ratio implies a shorter period that inventory is held and thus a lower DOH  In general  inventory turnover and DOH should be benchmarked against industry norms 
8,327,A high inventory turnover ratio relative to industry norms might indicate highly effective inventory management   Alternatively a high inventory turnover ratio  and commensurately low DOH  could possibly indicate the  company does not carry adequate inventory so shortages could potentially hurt revenue  To assess which  explanation is more likely the analyst can compare the company s revenue growth with that of the industry   Slower growth combined with higher inventory turnover could indicate inadequate inventory levels  Revenue  growth at or above the industry s growth supports the interpretation that the higher turnover reflects greater  inventory management efficiency 
9,327,A low inventory turnover ratio  and commensurately high DOH  relative to the rest of the industry could be an  indicator of slow moving inventory perhaps due to technological obsolescence or a change in fashion  Again  comparing the company s sales growth with the industry can offer insight 
10,327,Receivables Turnover and DSO 
11,327,The number of DSO represents the elapsed time between a sale and cash collection reflecting how fast the  company collects cash from customers to whom it offers credit  Although limiting the numerator to sales made on  credit in the receivables turnover would be more appropriate credit sales information is not always available to  analysts  therefore revenue as reported in the income statement is generally used as an approximation 
12,327,A relatively high receivables turnover ratio  and commensurately low DSO  might indicate highly efficient credit  and collection  Alternatively a high receivables turnover ratio could indicate that the company s credit or  collection policies are too stringent suggesting the possibility of sales being lost to competitors offering more  lenient terms  A relatively low receivables turnover ratio would typically raise questions about the efficiency of  the company s credit and collections procedures  As with inventory management comparison of the company s  sales growth relative to the industry can help the analyst assess whether sales are being lost due to stringent credit  policies  In addition comparing the company s estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable and actual credit  losses with past experience and with peer companies can help assess whether low turnover reflects credit  management issues  Companies often provide details of receivables aging  how much receivables have been  outstanding by age   This can be used along with DSO to understand trends in collection as demonstrated in  Example

23,328,Note  Lenovo s footnotes disclose that general trade customers are provided with    day credit terms 
24,328,These data indicate that total accounts receivable more than doubled in FY     versus FY     while  total sales increased by only      percent  This suggests that overall the company has been increasing  customer financing to drive its sales growth  The significant increase in accounts receivable in total was  the primary reason for the increase in DSO  The percentage of receivables older than    days has declined  significantly which is generally positive  However the large increase in      day receivables may be  indicative of aggressive accounting policies or sales practices  Perhaps Lenovo offered incentives to  generate a large amount of year end sales  While the data may suggest that the quality of receivables  improved in FY     versus FY     with a much lower percentage of receivables  and a much lower  absolute amount  that are more than    days outstanding and similarly a lower percentage of estimated  uncollectible receivables this should be investigated further by the analyst 
25,328,Payables Turnover and the Number of Days of Payables
26,328,The number of days of payables reflects the average number of days the company takes to pay its suppliers and  the payables turnover ratio measures how many times per year the company theoretically pays off all its creditors   For purposes of calculating these ratios an implicit assumption is that the company makes all its purchases using  credit  If the amount of purchases is not directly available it can be computed as cost of goods sold plus ending  inventory less beginning inventory  Alternatively cost of goods sold is sometimes used as an approximation of  purchases

2,329,A payables turnover ratio that is high  low days payable  relative to the industry could indicate that the company  is not making full use of available credit facilities  alternatively it could result from a company taking advantage  of early payment discounts  An excessively low turnover ratio  high days payable  could indicate trouble making  payments on time or alternatively exploitation of lenient supplier terms  This is another example where it is  useful to look simultaneously at other ratios  If liquidity ratios indicate that the company has sufficient cash and  other short term assets to pay obligations and yet the days payable ratio is relatively high the analyst would favor  the lenient supplier credit and collection policies as an explanation 
3,329,Working Capital Turnover
4,329,Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities  Working capital turnover indicates how  efficiently the company generates revenue with its working capital  For example a working capital turnover ratio  of     indicates that the company generates    of revenue for every    of working capital  A high working capital  turnover ratio indicates greater efficiency  i e  the company is generating a high level of revenues relative to  working capital   For some companies working capital can be near zero or negative rendering this ratio  incapable of being interpreted  The following two ratios are more useful in those circumstances 
5,329,Fixed Asset Turnover
6,329,This ratio measures how efficiently the company generates revenues from its investments in fixed assets   Generally a higher fixed asset turnover ratio indicates more efficient use of fixed assets in generating revenue  A  low ratio can indicate inefficiency a capital intensive business environment or a new business not yet operating  at full capacity in which case the analyst will not be able to link the ratio directly to efficiency  In addition asset  turnover can be affected by factors other than a company s efficiency  The fixed asset turnover ratio would be  lower for a company whose assets are newer  and therefore less depreciated and so reflected in the financial  statements at a higher carrying value  than the ratio for a company with older assets  that are thus more  depreciated and so reflected at a lower carrying value   The fixed asset ratio can be erratic because although  revenue may have a steady growth rate increases in fixed assets may not follow a smooth pattern  so every year  to year change in the ratio does not necessarily indicate important changes in the company s efficiency 
7,329,Total Asset Turnover
8,329,The total asset turnover ratio measures the company s overall ability to generate revenues with a given level of  assets  A ratio of      would indicate that the company is generating       of revenues for every    of average  assets  A higher ratio indicates greater efficiency  Because this ratio includes both fixed and current assets  inefficient working capital management can distort overall interpretations  It is therefore helpful to analyze  working capital and fixed asset turnover ratios separately 
9,329,A low asset turnover ratio can be an indicator of inefficiency or of relative capital intensity of the business  The  ratio also reflects strategic decisions by management for example the decision whether to use a more labor  intensive  and less capital intensive  approach to its business or a more capital intensive  and less labor intensive   approach 
10,329,When interpreting activity ratios the analysts should examine not only the individual ratios but also the collection  of relevant ratios to determine the overall efficiency of a company  Example   demonstrates the evaluation of  activity ratios both narrow  e g  days of inventory on hand  and broad  e g  total asset turnover  for a  hypothetical manufacturer 
11,329,EXAMPLE

4,330,         
5,330,         
6,330,         
7,330,These ratios indicate that the company has improved on all three measures of activity over the four year  period  The company appears to be managing its inventory more efficiently is collecting receivables  faster and is generating a higher level of revenues relative to total assets  The overall trend appears good  but thus far the analyst has only determined what happened  A more important question is why the ratios  improved because understanding good changes as well as bad ones facilitates judgments about the  company s future performance  To answer this question the analyst examines company financial reports  as well as external information about the industry and economy  In examining the annual report the  analyst notes that in the fourth quarter of      the company experienced an  inventory correction  and  that the company recorded an allowance for the decline in market value and obsolescence of inventory of  about    percent of year end inventory value  compared with about a   percent allowance in the prior  year   This reduction in the value of inventory accounts for a large portion of the decline in DOH from        in      to       in       Management claims that this inventory obsolescence is a short term issue   analysts can watch DOH in future interim periods to confirm this assertion  In any event all else being  equal the analyst would likely expect DOH to return to a level closer to    days going forward 
8,330,More positive interpretations can be drawn from the total asset turnover  The analyst finds that the  company s revenues increased more than    percent while total assets only increased by about   percent   Based on external information about the industry and economy the analyst attributes the increased  revenues both to overall growth in the industry and to the company s increased market share  Management  was able to achieve growth in revenues with a comparatively modest increase in assets leading to an  improvement in total asset turnover  Note further that part of the reason for the increase in asset turnover  is lower DOH and DSO 
9,330,     Liquidity Ratios
10,330,Liquidity analysis which focuses on cash flows measures a company s ability to meet its short term obligations   Liquidity measures how quickly assets are converted into cash  Liquidity ratios also measure the ability to pay off  short term obligations  In day to day operations liquidity management is typically achieved through efficient use  of assets  In the medium term liquidity in the non financial sector is also addressed by managing the structure of  liabilities   See the discussion on financial sector below  
11,330,The level of liquidity needed differs from one industry to another  A particular company s liquidity position may  vary according to the anticipated need for funds at any given time  Judging whether a company has adequate  liquidity requires analysis of its historical funding requirements current liquidity position anticipated future  funding needs and options for reducing funding needs or attracting additional funds  including actual and  potential sources of such funding  
12,330,Larger companies are usually better able to control the level and composition of their liabilities than smaller  companies  Therefore they may have more potential funding sources including public capital and money  markets  Greater discretionary access to capital markets also reduces the size of the liquidity buffer needed  relative to companies without such access 
13,330,Contingent liabilities such as letters of credit or financial guarantees can also be relevant when assessing  liquidity  The importance of contingent liabilities varies for the non banking and banking sector  In the non  banking sector contingent liabilities  usually disclosed in the footnotes to the company s financial statements   represent potential cash outflows and when appropriate should be included in an assessment of a company s  liquidity  In the banking sector contingent liabilities represent potentially significant cash outflows that are not  dependent on the bank s financial condition  Although outflows in normal market circumstances typically may be  low a general macroeconomic or market crisis can trigger a substantial increase in cash outflows related to  contingent liabilities because of the increase in defaults and business bankruptcies that often accompany such  events  In addition such crises are usually characterized by diminished levels of overall liquidity which can  further exacerbate funding shortfalls  Therefore for the banking sector the effect of contingent liabilities on  liquidity warrants particular attention

2,331,       Calculation of Liquidity Ratios
3,331,Common liquidity ratios are presented in Exhibit     These liquidity ratios reflect a company s position at a point  in time and therefore typically use data from the ending balance sheet rather than averages  The current quick  and cash ratios reflect three measures of a company s ability to pay current liabilities  Each uses a progressively  stricter definition of liquid assets 
4,331,The defensive interval ratio measures how long a company can pay its daily cash expenditures using only its  existing liquid assets without additional cash flow coming in  This ratio is similar to the  burn rate  often  computed for start up internet companies in the late     s or for biotechnology companies  The numerator of this  ratio includes the same liquid assets used in the quick ratio and the denominator is an estimate of daily cash  expenditures  To obtain daily cash expenditures the total of cash expenditures for the period is divided by the  number of days in the period  Total cash expenditures for a period can be approximated by summing all expenses  on the income statement such as cost of goods sold  selling general and administrative expenses  and research  and development expenses and then subtracting any non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortisation    Typically taxes are not included  
5,331,The cash conversion cycle a financial metric not in ratio form measures the length of time required for a  company to go from cash paid  used in its operations  to cash received  as a result of its operations   The cash  conversion cycle is sometimes expressed as the length of time funds are tied up in working capital  During this  period of time the company needs to finance its investment in operations through other sources  i e  through debt  or equity

11,331,       Interpretation of Liquidity Ratios
12,331,In the following we discuss the interpretation of the five basic liquidity measures presented in Exhibit    
13,331,Current Ratio
14,331,This ratio expresses current assets in relation to current liabilities  A higher ratio indicates a higher level of  liquidity  i e  a greater ability to meet short term obligations   A current ratio of     would indicate that the book  value of its current assets exactly equals the book value of its current liabilities 
15,331,A lower ratio indicates less liquidity implying a greater reliance on operating cash flow and outside financing to  meet short term obligations  Liquidity affects the company s capacity to take on debt  The current ratio implicitly  assumes that inventories and accounts receivable are indeed liquid  which is presumably not the case when  related turnover ratios are low

2,332,Quick Ratio
3,332,The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio because it includes only the more liquid current assets   sometimes referred to as  quick assets   in relation to current liabilities  Like the current ratio a higher quick  ratio indicates greater liquidity 
4,332,The quick ratio reflects the fact that certain current assets such as prepaid expenses some taxes and employee  related prepayments represent costs of the current period that have been paid in advance and cannot usually be  converted back into cash  This ratio also reflects the fact that inventory might not be easily and quickly converted  into cash and furthermore that a company would probably not be able to sell all of its inventory for an amount  equal to its carrying value especially if it were required to sell the inventory quickly  In situations where  inventories are illiquid  as indicated for example by low inventory turnover ratios  the quick ratio may be a  better indicator of liquidity than is the current ratio 
5,332,Cash Ratio
6,332,The cash ratio normally represents a reliable measure of an entity s liquidity in a crisis situation  Only highly  marketable short term investments and cash are included  In a general market crisis the fair value of marketable  securities could decrease significantly as a result of market factors in which case even this ratio might not  provide reliable information 
7,332,Defensive Interval Ratio
8,332,This ratio measures how long the company can continue to pay its expenses from its existing liquid assets without  receiving any additional cash inflow  A defensive interval ratio of    would indicate that the company can  continue to pay its operating expenses for    days before running out of quick assets assuming no additional cash  inflows  A higher defensive interval ratio indicates greater liquidity  If a company s defensive interval ratio is  very low relative to peer companies or to the company s own history the analyst would want to ascertain whether  there is sufficient cash inflow expected to mitigate the low defensive interval ratio 
9,332,Cash Conversion Cycle  Net Operating Cycle 
10,332,This metric indicates the amount of time that elapses from the point when a company invests in working capital  until the point at which the company collects cash  In the typical course of events a merchandising company  acquires inventory on credit incurring accounts payable  The company then sells that inventory on credit  increasing accounts receivable  Afterwards it pays out cash to settle its accounts payable and it collects cash in  settlement of its accounts receivable  The time between the outlay of cash and the collection of cash is called the   cash conversion cycle   A shorter cash conversion cycle indicates greater liquidity  A short cash conversion  cycle implies that the company only needs to finance its inventory and accounts receivable for a short period of  time  A longer cash conversion cycle indicates lower liquidity  it implies that the company must finance its  inventory and accounts receivable for a longer period of time possibly indicating a need for a higher level of  capital to fund current assets  Example   demonstrates the advantages of a short cash conversion cycle as well as  how a company s business strategies are reflected in financial ratios

2,333,The minimal DOH indicates that Dell maintains lean inventories which is attributable to key aspects of  the company s business model  The company does not build a computer until it is ordered and maintains a  just in time approach to inventory management  In isolation the increase in number of days payable  from     days in      to    days in       might suggest an inability to pay suppliers  however in Dell s case  the balance sheet indicates that the company has more than     billion of cash and short term  investments which would be more than enough to pay suppliers sooner if Dell chose to do so  Instead  Dell takes advantage of the favorable credit terms granted by its suppliers  The overall effect is a negative  cash cycle a somewhat unusual result  Instead of requiring additional capital to fund working capital as is  the case for most companies Dell has excess cash to invest for about    days  reflected on the balance  sheet as short term investments  on which it is earning rather than paying interest 
3,333,For comparison the analyst finds the cash conversion cycle reported in the annual reports of two of Dell s  competitors Lenovo and Hewlett Packard

11,333,This example considers the following question  If a larger negative number of days in a cash conversion  cycle is considered to be a desirable performance metric does identifying a company with a large negative  cash conversion cycle necessarily imply good performance 
12,333,Using the Compustat database the company identified as the US computer technology company with the  most negative number of days in its cash conversion cycle during the      to      period is National  Datacomputer Inc  which had a negative cash conversion cycle of       days in

2,334, Notes  Calculated using Cost of goods sold as an approximation of purchases  Ending inventories      and       are reported as    million  therefore inventory turnover for      cannot be measured  However given inventory  and average sales per day DOH in      is      
3,334,Source  Raw data from Compustat  Ratios calculated 
4,334,The reason for the negative cash conversion cycle is that the company s accounts payable increased  substantially over the period  An increase from approximately    days in      to     days in      to pay  trade creditors is clearly a negative signal  In addition the company s inventories disappeared most likely  because the company did not have enough cash to purchase new inventory and was unable to get  additional credit from its suppliers 
5,334,Of course an analyst would have immediately noted the negative trends in these data as well as  additional data throughout the company s financial statements  In its MD A the company clearly reports  the risks as follows 
6,334,Because we have historically had losses and only a limited amount of cash has been generated  from operations we have funded our operating activities to date primarily from the sale of  securities and from the sale of a product line in       In order to continue to fund our  operations we may need to raise additional capital through the sale of securities  We cannot  be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all  Moreover  additional equity financing if available would likely be dilutive to the holders of our  common stock and debt financing if available would likely involve restrictive covenants  and a security interest in all or substantially all of our assets  If we fail to obtain acceptable  financing when needed we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
7,334,IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL FROM  OPERATIONS OR RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT  ABOUT THE COMPANY S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN    emphasis added by company

9,334,In summary it is always necessary to consider ratios within bounds of reasonability and to understand the  reasons underlying changes in ratios  Ratios must not only be calculated but must also be interpreted by an  analyst 
10,334,     Solvency Ratios
11,334,Solvency refers to a company s ability to fulfill its long term debt obligations  Assessment of a company s  ability to pay its long term obligations  i e  to make interest and principal payments  generally includes an in  depth analysis of the components of its financial structure  Solvency ratios provide information regarding the  relative amount of debt in the company s capital structure and the adequacy of earnings and cash flow to cover  interest expenses and other fixed charges  such as lease or rental payments  as they come due 
12,334,Analysts seek to understand a company s use of debt for several main reasons  One reason is that the amount of  debt in a company s capital structure is important for assessing the company s risk and return characteristics  specifically its financial leverage  Leverage is a magnifying effect that results from the use of fixed costs costs  that stay the same within some range of activity and can take two forms  operating leverage and financial  leverage 
13,334,Operating leverage results from the use of fixed costs in conducting the company s business  Operating  leverage magnifies the effect of changes in sales on operating income  Profitable companies may use operating  leverage because when revenues increase with operating leverage their operating income increases at a faster  rate  The explanation is that although variable costs will rise proportionally with revenue fixed costs will not

2,335,When financing a company  i e  raising capital for it  the use of debt constitutes financial leverage because  interest payments are essentially fixed financing costs  As a result of interest payments a given percent change in  EBIT results in a larger percent change in earnings before taxes  EBT   Thus financial leverage tends to magnify  the effect of changes in EBIT on returns flowing to equity holders  Assuming that a company can earn more on  funds than it pays in interest the inclusion of some level of debt in a company s capital structure may lower a  company s overall cost of capital and increase returns to equity holders  However a higher level of debt in a  company s capital structure increases the risk of default and results in higher borrowing costs for the company to  compensate lenders for assuming greater credit risk  Starting with Modigliani and Miller             a  substantial amount of research has focused on determining a company s optimal capital structure and the subject  remains an important one in corporate finance 
3,335,In analyzing financial statements an analyst aims to understand levels and trends in a company s use of financial  leverage in relation to past practices and the practices of peer companies  Analysts also need to be aware of the  relationship between operating leverage  results from the use of non current assets with fixed costs  and financial  leverage  results from the use of long term debt with fixed costs   The greater a company s operating leverage  the greater the risk of the operating income stream available to cover debt payments  operating leverage can thus  limit a company s capacity to use financial leverage 
4,335,A company s relative solvency is fundamental to valuation of its debt securities and its creditworthiness  Finally  understanding a company s use of debt can provide analysts with insight into the company s future business  prospects because management s decisions about financing may signal their beliefs about a company s future  For  example the issuance of long term debt to repurchase common shares may indicate that management believes the  market is underestimating the company s prospects and that the shares are undervalued 
5,335,       Calculation of Solvency Ratios
6,335,Solvency ratios are primarily of two types  Debt ratios the first type focus on the balance sheet and measure the  amount of debt capital relative to equity capital  Coverage ratios the second type focus on the income statement  and measure the ability of a company to cover its debt payments  These ratios are useful in assessing a company s  solvency and therefore in evaluating the quality of a company s bonds and other debt obligations 
7,335,Exhibit    describes commonly used solvency ratios  The first three of the debt ratios presented use total debt in  the numerator  The definition of total debt used in these ratios varies among informed analysts and financial data  vendors with some using the total of interest bearing short term and long term debt excluding liabilities such as  accrued expenses and accounts payable   For calculations in this reading we use this definition   Other analysts  use definitions that are more inclusive  e g  all liabilities  or restrictive  e g  long term debt only in which case  the ratio is sometimes qualified as  long term  as in  long term debt to equity ratio    If using different  definitions of total debt materially changes conclusions about a company s solvency the reasons for the  discrepancies warrant further investigation

2,336,       Interpretation of Solvency Ratios
3,336,In the following we discuss the interpretation of the basic solvency ratios presented in Exhibit    
4,336,Debt to Assets Ratio
5,336,This ratio measures the percentage of total assets financed with debt  For example a debt to assets ratio of       or    percent indicates that    percent of the company s assets are financed with debt  Generally higher debt  means higher financial risk and thus weaker solvency 
6,336,Debt to Capital Ratio
7,336,The debt to capital ratio measures the percentage of a company s capital  debt plus equity  represented by debt   As with the previous ratio a higher ratio generally means higher financial risk and thus indicates weaker  solvency 
8,336,Debt to Equity Ratio
9,336,The debt to equity ratio measures the amount of debt capital relative to equity capital  Interpretation is similar  to the preceding two ratios  i e  a higher ratio indicates weaker solvency   A ratio of     would indicate equal  amounts of debt and equity which is equivalent to a debt to capital ratio of    percent  Alternative definitions of  this ratio use the market value of stockholders  equity rather than its book value  or use the market values of both  stockholders  equity and debt  
10,336,Financial Leverage Ratio
11,336,This ratio  often called simply the  leverage ratio   measures the amount of total assets supported for each one  money unit of equity  For example a value of   for this ratio means that each    of equity supports    of total  assets  The higher the financial leverage ratio the more leveraged the company is in the sense of using debt  and other liabilities to finance assets  This ratio is often defined in terms of average total assets and average total  equity and plays an important role in the DuPont decomposition of return on equity that will be presented in  Section       
12,336,Interest Coverage
13,336,This ratio measures the number of times a company s EBIT could cover its interest payments  Thus it is  sometimes referred to as  times interest earned   A higher interest coverage ratio indicates stronger solvency  offering greater assurance that the company can service its debt  i e  bank debt bonds notes  from operating  earnings 
14,336,Fixed Charge Coverage
15,336,This ratio relates fixed charges or obligations to the cash flow generated by the company  It measures the  number of times a company s earnings  before interest taxes and lease payments  can cover the company s  interest and lease payments   Similar to the interest coverage ratio a higher fixed charge coverage ratio  implies stronger solvency offering greater assurance that the company can service its debt  i e  bank debt bonds  notes and leases  from normal earnings  The ratio is sometimes used as an indication of the quality of the  preferred dividend with a higher ratio indicating a more secure preferred dividend 
16,336,Example    demonstrates the use of solvency ratios in evaluating the creditworthiness of a company

26,337,B  On all three metrics the company s leverage has increased  The increase in debt as part of the  company s capital structure indicates that the company s solvency has weakened  From a creditor s  perspective lower solvency  higher debt  indicates higher risk of default on obligations

2,338,As with all ratio analysis it is important to consider leverage ratios in a broader context  In general companies  with lower business risk and operations that generate steady cash flows are better positioned to take on more  leverage without a commensurate increase in the risk of insolvency  In other words a higher proportion of debt  financing poses less risk of non payment of interest and debt principal to a company with steady cash flows than  to a company with volatile cash flows 
3,338,     Profitability Ratios
4,338,The ability to generate profit on capital invested is a key determinant of a company s overall value and the value  of the securities it issues  Consequently many equity analysts would consider profitability to be a key focus of  their analytical efforts 
5,338,Profitability reflects a company s competitive position in the market and by extension the quality of its  management  The income statement reveals the sources of earnings and the components of revenue and expenses   Earnings can be distributed to shareholders or reinvested in the company  Reinvested earnings enhance solvency  and provide a cushion against short term problems 
6,338,       Calculation of Profitability Ratios
7,338,Profitability ratios measure the return earned by the company during a period  Exhibit    provides the definitions  of a selection of commonly used profitability ratios  Return on sales profitability ratios express various subtotals  on the income statement  e g  gross profit operating profit net profit  as a percentage of revenue  Essentially  these ratios constitute part of a common size income statement discussed earlier  Return on investment  profitability ratios measure income relative to assets equity or total capital employed by the company  For  operating ROA returns are measured as operating income i e  prior to deducting interest on debt capital  For  ROA and ROE returns are measured as net income i e  after deducting interest paid on debt capital  For return  on common equity returns are measured as net income minus preferred dividends  because preferred dividends  are a return to preferred equity

2,339,       Interpretation of Profitability Ratios
3,339,In the following we discuss the interpretation of the profitability ratios presented in Exhibit     For each of the  profitability ratios a higher ratio indicates greater profitability 
4,339,Gross Profit Margin
5,339,Gross profit margin indicates the percentage of revenue available to cover operating and other expenses and to  generate profit  Higher gross profit margin indicates some combination of higher product pricing and lower  product costs  The ability to charge a higher price is constrained by competition so gross profits are affected by   and usually inversely related to  competition  If a product has a competitive advantage  e g  superior branding  better quality or exclusive technology  the company is better able to charge more for it  On the cost side higher  gross profit margin can also indicate that a company has a competitive advantage in product costs 
6,339,Operating Profit Margin
7,339,Operating profit is calculated as gross profit minus operating costs  So an operating profit margin increasing  faster than the gross profit margin can indicate improvements in controlling operating costs such as  administrative overheads  In contrast a declining operating profit margin could be an indicator of deteriorating  control over operating costs 
8,339,Pretax Margin
9,339,Pretax income  also called  earnings before tax  or  EBT   is calculated as operating profit minus interest and  the pretax margin is the ratio of pretax income to revenue  The pretax margin reflects the effects on profitability  of leverage and other  non operating  income and expenses  If a company s pretax margin is increasing primarily  as a result of increasing amounts of non operating income the analyst should evaluate whether this increase  reflects a deliberate change in a company s business focus and therefore the likelihood that the increase will  continue 
10,339,Net Profit Margin
11,339,Net profit or net income is calculated as revenue minus all expenses  Net income includes both recurring and  non recurring components  Generally the net income used in calculating the net profit margin is adjusted for non  recurring items to offer a better view of a company s potential future profitability 
12,339,ROA
13,339,ROA measures the return earned by a company on its assets  The higher the ratio the more income is generated  by a given level of assets  Most databases compute this ratio as 
14,339,Net income Average total assets
15,339,An issue with this computation is that net income is the return to equity holders whereas assets are financed by  both equity holders and creditors  Interest expense  the return to creditors  has already been subtracted in the  numerator  Some analysts therefore prefer to add back interest expense in the numerator  In such cases interest  must be adjusted for income taxes because net income is determined after taxes  With this adjustment the ratio  would be computed as 
16,339,Net income   Interest expense     Tax rate  Average total assets
17,339,Alternatively some analysts elect to compute ROA on a pre interest and pre tax basis  operating ROA in Exhibit      as 
18,339,Operating income or EBIT Average total assets

2,340,In this ROA calculation returns are measured prior to deducting interest on debt capital  i e  as operating income  or EBIT   This measure reflects the return on all assets invested in the company whether financed with liabilities  debt or equity  Whichever form of ROA is chosen the analyst must use it consistently in comparisons to other  companies or time periods 
3,340,Return on Total Capital
4,340,Return on total capital measures the profits a company earns on all of the capital that it employs  short term  debt long term debt and equity   As with operating ROA returns are measured prior to deducting interest on  debt capital  i e  as operating income or EBIT  
5,340,ROE
6,340,ROE measures the return earned by a company on its equity capital including minority equity preferred equity  and common equity  As noted return is measured as net income  i e  interest on debt capital is not included in the  return on equity capital   A variation of ROE is return on common equity which measures the return earned by a  company only on its common equity 
7,340,Both ROA and ROE are important measures of profitability and will be explored in more detail in section         As with other ratios profitability ratios should be evaluated individually and as a group to gain an understanding  of what is driving profitability  operating versus non operating activities   Example    demonstrates the  evaluation of profitability ratios and the use of the management report  sometimes called management s  discussion and analysis or management commentary  that accompanies financial statements to explain the trend  in ratios 
8,340,EXAMPLE

15,340,The main reason for the decline  in EBIT  was a significant drop in revenue due to markedly  lower unit sales in all vehicle segments as a result of the global economic downturn  Cost  savings achieved through permanent and temporary cost reductions and efficiency  improvements realized through ongoing optimization programs could only partially  compensate for the drop in revenue

3,341,   Compare net profit margins and pretax margins over      to     
4,341,Solution to   
5,341,Gross profit margin improved from      to      as a result of some combination of price increases and or  cost control  However gross profit margin declined from      to       Operating profit margin showed a  similar trend  In      the operating profit margin was negative 
6,341,Solution to   
7,341,The decline in operating profit from      percent in      to       percent in      appears to be the result  of Daimler s operating leverage  Management indicated that revenue declined in      and reductions in  expenses were not enough to offset the revenue decline  Management tried to increase efficiency and  reduce costs including personnel expenses but this did not sufficiently counteract the decrease in  revenues  Expenses thus increased as a proportion of revenue lowering the gross and operating profit  margins  This is an example of the effects of operating leverage  fixed costs that could not be reduced  on  profitability  In general as revenue increases to the extent that costs remain fixed operating profit  margins should increase  As revenue declines the opposite occurs 
8,341,Solution to   
9,341,Pretax margin was down substantially in      indicating that the company may have had some non  operating losses or high interest expense in that year  A review of the company s annual report confirms  that the cause was higher net interest expense  Specifically the company increased financing liabilities  faced higher financing costs because of higher risk premiums on borrowing and had lower interest  income on investments  This is an example of the effects of financial leverage on profitability 
10,341,Solution to   
11,341,Net profit margin followed the same pattern as pretax margin increasing from      to      and then  decreasing from      to       In the absence of major variation in the applicable tax rates this would be  expected as net profit margin is based on net income while pretax margin is based on EBT and net  income is EBT     Tax rate  
12,341,     Integrated Financial Ratio Analysis
13,341,In prior sections the text presented separately activity liquidity solvency and profitability ratios  Prior to  discussing valuation ratios the following sections demonstrate the importance of examining a variety of financial  ratios not a single ratio or category of ratios in isolation to ascertain the overall position and performance of a  company  Experience shows that the information from one ratio category can be helpful in answering questions  raised by another category and that the most accurate overall picture comes from integrating information from all  sources  Section       provides some introductory examples of such analysis and Section       shows how return  on equity can be analyzed into components related to profit margin asset utilization  activity  and financial  leverage 
14,341,       The Overall Ratio Picture  Examples
15,341,This section presents two simple illustrations to introduce the use of a variety of ratios to address an analytical  task  Example    shows how the analysis of a pair of activity ratios resolves an issue concerning a company s  liquidity  Example    shows that examining the overall ratios of multiple companies can assist an analyst in  drawing conclusions about their relative performances

3,342,A Variety of Ratios
4,342,An analyst is evaluating the liquidity of a Canadian manufacturing company and obtains the following  liquidity ratios 
5,342,Fiscal Year        Current ratio             Quick ratio            
6,342,The ratios present a contradictory picture of the company s liquidity  Based on the increase in its current  ratio from     to     the company appears to have strong and improving liquidity  however based on the  decline of the quick ratio from     to     its liquidity appears to be deteriorating  Because both ratios have  exactly the same denominator current liabilities the difference must be the result of changes in some  asset that is included in the current ratio but not in the quick ratio  e g  inventories   The analyst collects  the following activity ratios 
7,342,DOH       DSO      
8,342,     
9,342,The company s DOH has deteriorated from    days to    days meaning that the company is holding  increasingly larger amounts of inventory relative to sales  The decrease in DSO implies that the company  is collecting receivables faster  If the proceeds from these collections were held as cash there would be no  effect on either the current ratio or the quick ratio  However if the proceeds from the collections were  used to purchase inventory there would be no effect on the current ratio and a decline in the quick ratio   i e  the pattern shown in this example   Collectively the ratios suggest that liquidity is declining and that  the company may have an inventory problem that needs to be addressed

11,343,C  In FY  Clarence s receivables turnover of      times indicated that it was more efficient at  receivables management than Anson which had receivables turnover of       
12,343,Solution 
13,343,A is correct  Over the past four years Anson has shown greater improvement in efficiency than Clarence  as indicated by its total asset turnover ratio increasing from      to       Over the same period of time  Clarence s total asset turnover ratio has declined from      to       Choices B and C are incorrect because  DOH and receivables turnover are misinterpreted 
14,343,       DuPont Analysis  The Decomposition of ROE
15,343,As noted earlier ROE measures the return a company generates on its equity capital  To understand what drives a  company s ROE a useful technique is to decompose ROE into its component parts   Decomposition of ROE is  sometimes referred to as DuPont analysis because it was developed originally at that company   Decomposing  ROE involves expressing the basic ratio  i e  net income divided by average shareholders  equity  as the product  of component ratios  Because each of these component ratios is an indicator of a distinct aspect of a company s  performance that affects ROE the decomposition allows us to evaluate how these different aspects of  performance affected the company s profitability as measured by ROE

2,344,Decomposing ROE is useful in determining the reasons for changes in ROE over time for a given company and  for differences in ROE for different companies in a given time period  The information gained can also be used  by management to determine which areas they should focus on to improve ROE  This decomposition will also  show why a company s overall profitability measured by ROE is a function of its efficiency operating  profitability taxes and use of financial leverage  DuPont analysis shows the relationship between the various  categories of ratios discussed in this reading and how they all influence the return to the investment of the owners 
3,344,Analysts have developed several different methods of decomposing ROE  The decomposition presented here is  one of the most commonly used and the one found in popular research databases such as Bloomberg  Return on  equity is calculated as 
4,344,ROE   Net income Average shareholders  equity
5,344,The decomposition of ROE makes use of simple algebra and illustrates the relationship between ROE and ROA   Expressing ROE as a product of only two of its components we can write 
6,344,Equation   a 
7,344,ROE  
8,344, 
9,344,which can be interpreted as 
10,344,ROE   ROA   Leverage
11,344,Net income Average shareholders  equity Average total assets Average shareholders  equity
12,344,Net income Average total assets
13,344, 
14,344,In other words ROE is a function of a company s ROA and its use of financial leverage   leverage  for short in  this discussion   A company can improve its ROE by improving ROA or making more effective use of leverage   Consistent with the definition given earlier leverage is measured as average total assets divided by average  shareholders  equity  If a company had no leverage  no liabilities  its leverage ratio would equal     and ROE  would exactly equal ROA  As a company takes on liabilities its leverage increases  As long as a company is able  to borrow at a rate lower than the marginal rate it can earn investing the borrowed money in its business the  company is making an effective use of leverage and ROE would increase as leverage increases  If a company s  borrowing cost exceeds the marginal rate it can earn on investing in the business ROE would decline as leverage  increased because the effect of borrowing would be to depress ROA 
15,344,Using the data from Example    for Anson Industries an analyst can examine the trend in ROE and determine  whether the increase from an ROE of        percent in FY  to       percent in FY  is a function of ROA or the  use of leverage

20,344,  Leverage                    
21,344,Over the four year period the company s leverage factor was relatively stable  The primary reason for the  increase in ROE is the increase in profitability measured by ROA 
22,344,Just as ROE can be decomposed the individual components such as ROA can be decomposed  Further  decomposing ROA we can express ROE as a product of three component ratios 
23,344,Equation   b

2,345,The first term on the right hand side of this equation is the net profit margin an indicator of profitability  how  much income a company derives per one monetary unit  e g  euro or dollar  of sales  The second term on the  right is the asset turnover ratio an indicator of efficiency  how much revenue a company generates per one  money unit of assets  Note that ROA is decomposed into these two components  net profit margin and total asset  turnover  A company s ROA is a function of profitability  net profit margin  and efficiency  total asset turnover    The third term on the right hand side of Equation  b is a measure of financial leverage an indicator of solvency   the total amount of a company s assets relative to its equity capital  This decomposition illustrates that a  company s ROE is a function of its net profit margin its efficiency and its leverage  Again using the data from  Example    for Anson Industries the analyst can evaluate in more detail the reasons behind the trend in ROE   
3,345,ROE

5,345,FY  FY  FY  FY 
6,345,This further decomposition confirms that increases in profitability  measured here as net profit margin  are indeed  an important contributor to the increase in ROE over the four year period  However Anson s asset turnover has  also increased steadily  The increase in ROE is therefore a function of improving profitability and improving  efficiency  As noted above ROE decomposition can also be used to compare the ROEs of peer companies as  demonstrated in Example    
7,345,EXAMPLE   
8,345,A Comparison of Two Companies    
9,345,Referring to the data for Anson Industries and Clarence Corporation in Example    which of the  following choices best describes reasonable conclusions an analyst might make about the companies   ROE 
10,345,A  Anson s inventory turnover of       indicates it is more profitable than Clarence 
11,345,B  The main driver of Clarence s superior ROE in FY  is its more efficient use of assets 
12,345,C  The main drivers of Clarence s superior ROE in FY  are its greater use of debt financing and higher  net profit margin 
13,345,Solution 
14,345,C is correct  The main driver of Clarence s superior ROE       percent compared with only      percent  for Anson  in FY  is its greater use of debt financing  leverage of      compared with Anson s leverage  of       and higher net profit margin       percent compared with only      percent for Anson   A is  incorrect because inventory turnover is not a direct indicator of profitability  An increase in inventory  turnover may indicate more efficient use of inventory which in turn could affect profitability  however an  increase in inventory turnover would also be observed if a company was selling more goods even if it was  not selling those goods at a profit  B is incorrect because Clarence has less efficient use of assets than  Anson indicated by turnover of      for Clarence compared with Anson s turnover of      
15,345,To separate the effects of taxes and interest we can further decompose the net profit margin and write

2,346,ROE   Tax burden   Interest burden   EBIT margin   Total asset turnover   Leverage
3,346,This five way decomposition is the one found in financial databases such as Bloomberg  The first term on the  right hand side of this equation measures the effect of taxes on ROE  Essentially it reflects one minus the average  tax rate or how much of a company s pretax profits it gets to keep  This can be expressed in decimal or  percentage form  So a    percent tax rate would yield a factor of      or    percent  A higher value for the tax  burden implies that the company can keep a higher percentage of its pretax profits indicating a lower tax rate  A  decrease in the tax burden ratio implies the opposite  i e  a higher tax rate leaving the company with less of its  pretax profits  
4,346,The second term on the right hand side captures the effect of interest on ROE  Higher borrowing costs reduce  ROE  Some analysts prefer to use operating income instead of EBIT for this term and the following term  Either  operating income or EBIT is acceptable as long as it is applied consistently  In such a case the second term would  measure both the effect of interest expense and non operating income on ROE 
5,346,The third term on the right hand side captures the effect of operating margin  if operating income is used in the  numerator  or EBIT margin  if EBIT is used  on ROE  In either case this term primarily measures the effect of  operating profitability on ROE 
6,346,The fourth term on the right hand side is again the total asset turnover ratio an indicator of the overall efficiency  of the company  i e  how much revenue it generates per unit of total assets   The fifth term on the right hand side  is the financial leverage ratio described above the total amount of a company s assets relative to its equity  capital 
7,346,This decomposition expresses a company s ROE as a function of its tax rate interest burden operating  profitability efficiency and leverage  An analyst can use this framework to determine what factors are driving a  company s ROE  The decomposition of ROE can also be useful in forecasting ROE based upon expected  efficiency profitability financing activities and tax rates  The relationship of the individual factors such as ROA  to the overall ROE can also be expressed in the form of an ROE tree to study the contribution of each of the five  factors as shown in Exhibit    for Anson Industries   
8,346,Exhibit    shows that Anson s ROE of      percent in FY  can be decomposed into ROA of      percent and  leverage of       ROA can further be decomposed into a net profit margin of      percent and total asset turnover  of       Net profit margin can be decomposed into a tax burden of       an average tax rate of    percent  an  interest burden of      and an EBIT margin of      percent  Overall ROE is decomposed into five components

2,348,The tax burden measure has varied with no obvious trend  In the most recent year      taxes declined as  a percentage of pretax profit   Because the tax burden reflects the relation of after tax profits to pretax  profits the increase from       percent in      to       percent in      indicates that taxes declined as a  percentage of pretax profits   This decline in average tax rates could be a result of lower tax rates from  new legislation or revenue in a lower tax jurisdiction  The interest burden has remained fairly constant  over the four year period indicating that the company maintains a fairly constant capital structure   Operating margin  EBIT margin  declined over the period indicating the company s operations were less  profitable  This decline is generally consistent with declines in oil prices in      and declines in refining  industry gross margins in      and       The company s efficiency  asset turnover  decreased in        The company s leverage remained constant consistent with the constant interest burden  Overall the trend  in ROE  declining substantially over the recent years  resulted from decreases in operating profits and a  lower asset turnover  Additional research on the causes of these changes is required in order to develop  expectations about the company s future performance 
3,348,The most detailed decomposition of ROE that we have presented is a five way decomposition  Nevertheless an  analyst could further decompose individual components of a five way analysis  For example EBIT margin   EBIT Revenue  could be further decomposed into a non operating component  EBIT Operating income  and an  operating component  Operating income Revenue   The analyst can also examine which other factors contributed  to these five components  For example an improvement in efficiency  total asset turnover  may have resulted  from better management of inventory  DOH  or better collection of receivables  DSO  
4,348,   EQUITY ANALYSIS
5,348,One application of financial analysis is to select securities as part of the equity portfolio management process   Analysts are interested in valuing a security to assess its merits for inclusion or retention in a portfolio  The  valuation process has several steps including 
6,348,   understanding the business and the existing financial profile
7,348,   forecasting company performance
8,348,   selecting the appropriate valuation model
9,348,   converting forecasts to a valuation
10,348,   making the investment decision
11,348,Financial analysis assists in providing the core information to complete the first two steps of this valuation  process  understanding the business and forecasting performance 
12,348,Fundamental equity analysis involves evaluating a company s performance and valuing its equity in order to  assess its relative attractiveness as an investment  Analysts use a variety of methods to value a company s equity  including valuation ratios  e g  the price to earnings or P E ratio  discounted cash flow approaches and residual  income approaches  ROE compared with the cost of capital  among others  The following section addresses the  first of these approaches the use of valuation ratios 
13,348,     Valuation Ratios
14,348,Valuation ratios have long been used in investment decision making  A well known example is the price to  earnings ratio  P E ratio  probably the most widely cited indicator in discussing the value of equity  securities which relates share price to the earnings per share  EPS   Additionally some analysts use other  market multiples such as price to book value  P B  and price to cash flow  P CF   The following sections explore  valuation ratios and other quantities related to valuing equities

20,349,The P E ratio expresses the relationship between the price per share and the amount of earnings attributable to a  single share  In other words the P E ratio tells us how much an investor in common stock pays per dollar of  earnings 
21,349,Because P E ratios are calculated using net income the ratios can be sensitive to non recurring earnings or one  time earnings events  In addition because net income is generally considered to be more susceptible to  manipulation than are cash flows analysts may use price to cash flow as an alternative measure particularly  in situations where earnings quality may be an issue  EBITDA per share because it is calculated using income  before interest taxes and depreciation can be used to eliminate the effect of different levels of fixed asset  investment across companies  It facilitates comparison between companies in the same sector but at different  stages of infrastructure maturity  Price to sales is calculated in a similar manner and is sometimes used as a  comparative price metric when a company does not have positive net income

2,350,Another price based ratio that facilitates useful comparisons of companies  stock prices is price to book value  or P B which is the ratio of price to book value per share  This ratio is often interpreted as an indicator of market  judgment about the relationship between a company s required rate of return and its actual rate of return   Assuming that book values reflect the fair values of the assets a price to book ratio of one can be interpreted as  an indicator that the company s future returns are expected to be exactly equal to the returns required by the  market  A ratio greater than one would indicate that the future profitability of the company is expected to exceed  the required rate of return and values of this ratio less than one indicate that the company is not expected to earn  excess returns   
3,350,       Interpretation of Earnings per Share
4,350,Exhibit    presented a number of per share quantities that can be used in valuation ratios  In this section we  discuss the interpretation of one such critical quantity earnings per share or EPS   
5,350,EPS is simply the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock  In isolation EPS does not  provide adequate information for comparison of one company with another  For example assume that two  companies have only common stock outstanding and no dilutive securities outstanding  In addition assume the  two companies have identical net income of     million identical book equity of      million and therefore  identical profitability     percent using ending equity in this case for simplicity   Furthermore assume that  Company A has     million weighted average common shares outstanding whereas Company B has    million  weighted average common shares outstanding  So Company A will report EPS of       per share and Company  B will report EPS of    per share  The difference in EPS does not reflect a difference in profitability the  companies have identical profits and profitability  The difference reflects only a different number of common  shares outstanding  Analysts should understand in detail the types of EPS information that companies report 
6,350,Basic EPS provides information regarding the earnings attributable to each share of common stock    To  calculate basic EPS the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is first calculated  The  weighted average number of shares consists of the number of ordinary shares outstanding at the beginning of the  period adjusted by those bought back or issued during the period multiplied by a time weighting factor 
7,350,Accounting standards generally require the disclosure of basic as well as diluted EPS  diluted EPS includes the  effect of all the company s securities whose conversion or exercise would result in a reduction of basic EPS   dilutive securities include convertible debt convertible preferred warrants and options   Basic EPS and diluted  EPS must be shown with equal prominence on the face of the income statement for each class of ordinary share   Disclosure includes the amounts used as the numerators in calculating basic and diluted EPS and a reconciliation  of those amounts to the company s profit or loss for the period  Because both basic and diluted EPS are presented  in a company s financial statements an analyst does not need to calculate these measures for reported financial  statements  Understanding the calculations is however helpful for situations requiring an analyst to calculate  expected future EPS 
8,350,To calculate diluted EPS earnings are adjusted for the after tax effects assuming conversion and the following  adjustments are made to the weighted number of shares 
9,350,  The weighted average number of shares for basic EPS plus those that would be issued on conversion of all  dilutive potential ordinary shares  Potential ordinary shares are treated as dilutive when their conversion  would decrease net profit per share from continuing ordinary operations 
10,350,  These shares are deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period or if  later at the date of the issue of the shares 
11,350,  Options warrants  and their equivalents  convertible instruments contingently issuable shares contracts  that can be settled in ordinary shares or cash purchased options and written put options should be  considered 
12,350,       Dividend Related Quantities
13,350,In this section we discuss the interpretation of the dividend related quantities presented in Exhibit     These  quantities play a role in some present value models for valuing equities

2,351,Dividend Payout Ratio
3,351,The dividend payout ratio measures the percentage of earnings that the company pays out as dividends to  shareholders  The amount of dividends per share tends to be relatively fixed because any reduction in dividends  has been shown to result in a disproportionately large reduction in share price  Because dividend amounts are  relatively fixed the dividend payout ratio tends to fluctuate with earnings  Therefore conclusions about a  company s dividend payout policies should be based on examination of payout over a number of periods  Optimal  dividend policy similar to optimal capital structure has been examined in academic research and continues to be  a topic of significant interest in corporate finance 
4,351,Retention Rate
5,351,The retention rate or earnings retention rate is the complement of the payout ratio or dividend payout ratio  i e       payout ratio   Whereas the payout ratio measures the percentage of earnings that a company pays out as  dividends the retention rate is the percentage of earnings that a company retains   Note that both the payout ratio  and retention rate are both percentages of earnings  The difference in terminology  ratio  versus  rate  versus   percentage  reflects common usage rather than any substantive differences  
6,351,Sustainable Growth Rate
7,351,A company s sustainable growth rate is viewed as a function of its profitability  measured as ROE  and its  ability to finance itself from internally generated funds  measured as the retention rate   The sustainable growth  rate is ROE times the retention rate  A higher ROE and a higher retention rate result in a higher sustainable  growth rate  This calculation can be used to estimate a company s growth rate a factor commonly used in equity  valuation 
8,351,     Industry Specific Ratios
9,351,As stated earlier in this reading a universally accepted definition and classification of ratios does not exist  The  purpose of ratios is to serve as indicators of important aspects of a company s performance and value  Aspects of  performance that are considered important in one industry may be irrelevant in another and industry specific  ratios reflect these differences  For example companies in the retail industry may report same store sales changes  because in the retail industry it is important to distinguish between growth that results from opening new stores  and growth that results from generating more sales at existing stores  Industry specific metrics can be especially  important to the value of equity in early stage industries where companies are not yet profitable 
10,351,In addition regulated industries especially in the financial sector often are required to comply with specific  regulatory ratios  For example the banking sector s liquidity and cash reserve ratios provide an indication of  banking liquidity and reflect monetary and regulatory requirements  Banking capital adequacy requirements  attempt to relate banks  solvency requirements directly to their specific levels of risk exposure

17,352,     Research on Ratios in Equity Analysis
18,352,Some ratios may be particularly useful in equity analysis  The end product of equity analysis is often a valuation  and investment recommendation  Theoretical valuation models are useful in selecting ratios that would be useful  in this process  For example a company s P B is theoretically linked to ROE growth and the required return   ROE is also a primary determinant of residual income in a residual income valuation model  In both cases higher  ROE relative to the required return denotes a higher valuation  Similarly profit margin is related to justified  price to sales  P S  ratios  Another common valuation method involves forecasts of future cash flows that are  discounted back to the present  Trends in ratios can be useful in forecasting future earnings and cash flows  e g   trends in operating profit margin and collection of customer receivables   Future growth expectations are a key  component of all of these valuation models  Trends may be useful in assessing growth prospects  when used in  conjunction with overall economic and industry trends   The variability in ratios and common size data can be  useful in assessing risk an important component of the required rate of return in valuation models  A great deal of  academic research has focused on the use of these fundamental ratios in evaluating equity investments 
19,352,A classic study Ou and Penman      a and     b  found that ratios and common size metrics generated from  accounting data were useful in forecasting earnings and stock returns  Ou and Penman examined    such metrics  and found that these could be reduced to a more parsimonious list of relevant variables including percentage  changes in a variety of measures such as current ratio inventory and sales  gross and pretax margins  and returns  on assets and equity  These variables were found to be useful in forecasting earnings and stock returns

2,353,Subsequent studies have also demonstrated the usefulness of ratios in evaluation of equity investments and  valuation  Lev and Thiagarajan        examined fundamental financial variables used by analysts to assess  whether they are useful in security valuation  They found that fundamental variables add about    percent to the  explanatory power of earnings alone in predicting excess returns  stock returns in excess of those expected   The  fundamental variables they found useful included percentage changes in inventory and receivables relative to  sales gross margin sales per employee and the change in bad debts relative to the change in accounts receivable  among others  Abarbanell and Bushee        found some of the same variables useful in predicting future  accounting earnings  Abarbanell and Bushee        devised an investment strategy using these same variables  and found that they can generate excess returns under this strategy 
3,353,Piotroski        used financial ratios to supplement a value investing strategy and found that he can generate  significant excess returns  Variables used by Piotroski include ROA cash flow ROA change in ROA change in  leverage change in liquidity change in gross margin and change in inventory turnover 
4,353,This research shows that in addition to being useful in evaluating the past performance of a company ratios can  be useful in predicting future earnings and equity returns 
5,353,   CREDIT ANALYSIS
6,353,Credit risk is the risk of loss caused by a counterparty s or debtor s failure to make a promised payment  For  example credit risk with respect to a bond is the risk that the obligor  the issuer of the bond  is not able to pay  interest and principal according to the terms of the bond indenture  contract   Credit analysis is the evaluation of  credit risk 
7,353,Approaches to credit analysis vary and as with all financial analysis depend on the purpose of the analysis and  the context in which it is done  Credit analysis for specific types of debt  e g  acquisition financing and other  highly leveraged financing  often involves projections of period by period cash flows similar to projections made  by equity analysts  Whereas the equity analyst may discount projected cash flows to determine the value of the  company s equity a credit analyst would use the projected cash flows to assess the likelihood of a company  complying with its financial covenants in each period and paying interest and principal as due    The analysis  would also include expectations about asset sales and refinancing options open to the company 
8,353,Credit analysis may relate to the borrower s credit risk in a particular transaction or to its overall creditworthiness   In assessing overall creditworthiness one general approach is credit scoring a statistical analysis of the  determinants of credit default 
9,353,Another general approach to credit analysis is the credit rating process that is used for example by credit rating  agencies to assess and communicate the probability of default by an issuer on its debt obligations  e g   commercial paper notes and bonds   A credit rating can be either long term or short term and is an indication of  the rating agency s opinion of the creditworthiness of a debt issuer with respect to a specific debt security or other  obligation  Where a company has no debt outstanding a rating agency can also provide an issuer credit rating that  expresses an opinion of the issuer s overall capacity and willingness to meet its financial obligations  The  following sections review research on the use of ratios in credit analysis and the ratios commonly used in credit  analysis 
10,353,     The Credit Rating Process
11,353,The rating process involves both the analysis of a company s financial reports as well as a broad assessment of a  company s operations  The credit evaluation process by any analyst includes many of the following procedures  performed by analysts at credit rating agencies   
12,353,  Meeting with management typically including the chief financial officer to discuss for example industry  outlook overview of major business segments financial policies and goals distinctive accounting  practices capital spending plans and financial contingency plans

12,354,  Monitoring of publicly distributed ratings including reconsideration of ratings due to changing conditions 
13,354,In assigning credit ratings rating agencies emphasize the importance of the relationship between a company s  business risk profile and its financial risk   The company s business risk profile determines the level of financial  risk appropriate for any rating category    
14,354,When analyzing financial ratios rating agencies normally investigate deviations of ratios from the median ratios  of the universe of companies for which such ratios have been calculated and also use the median ratings as an  indicator for the ratings grade given to a specific debt issuer  This so called universe of rated companies changes  constantly and any calculations are obviously affected by economic factors as well as by mergers and  acquisitions  International ratings include the influence of country and economic risk factors  Exhibit    presents  key financial ratios used by Standard   Poor s in evaluating industrial companies  Note that before calculating  ratios rating agencies make certain adjustments to reported financials such as adjusting debt to include off  balance sheet debt in a company s total debt

9,355,     Research on Ratios in Credit Analysis
10,355,A great deal of academic and practitioner research has focused on determining which ratios are useful in  assessing the credit risk of a company including the risk of bankruptcy 
11,355,One of the earliest studies examined individual ratios to assess their ability to predict failure of a company up to  five years in advance  Beaver        found that six ratios could correctly predict company failure one year in  advance    percent of the time and five years in advance at least    percent of the time  The ratios found effective  by Beaver were cash flow to total debt ROA total debt to total assets working capital to total assets the current  ratio and the no credit interval ratio  the length of time a company could go without borrowing   Altman        and Altman Haldeman and Narayanan        found that financial ratios could be combined in an effective  model for predicting bankruptcy  Altman s initial work involved creation of a Z score that was able to correctly  predict financial distress  The Z score was computed as
12,355,Z          Current assets   Current liabilities  Total assets             Retained earnings Total assets              EBIT Total assets              Market value of stock Book value of liabilities              Sales Total assets 
13,355,In his initial study a Z score of lower than      predicted failure and the model was able to accurately classify     percent of companies studied into a failure group and a non failure group  The original model was designed for  manufacturing companies  Subsequent refinements to the models allow for other company types and time periods   Generally the variables found to be useful in prediction include profitability ratios coverage ratios liquidity  ratios capitalization ratios and earnings variability  Altman       
14,355,Similar research has been performed on the ability of ratios to predict bond ratings and bond yields  For example  Ederington Yawtiz and Roberts        found that a small number of variables  total assets interest coverage  leverage variability of coverage and subordination status  were effective in explaining bond yields  Similarly  Ederington        found that nine variables in combination could correctly classify more than    percent of bond  ratings  These variables included ROA long term debt to assets interest coverage cash flow to debt variability  of coverage and cash flow total assets and subordination status  These studies have shown that ratios are  effective in evaluating credit risk bond yields and bond ratings

2,356,Analysts often need to evaluate the performance underlying business segments  subsidiary companies operating  units or simply operations in different geographic areas  to understand in detail the company as a whole   Although companies are not required to provide full financial statements for segments they are required to  provide segment information under both IFRS and US GAAP   
3,356,     Segment Reporting Requirements
4,356,An operating segment is defined as a component of a company  a  that engages in activities that may generate  revenue and create expenses including a start up segment that has yet to earn revenues b  whose results are  regularly reviewed by the company s senior management and c  for which discrete financial information is  available    A company must disclose separate information about any operating segment which meets certain  quantitative criteria namely the segment constitutes    percent or more of the combined operating segments   revenue assets or profit   For purposes of determining whether a segment constitutes    percent or more of  combined profits or losses the criteria is expressed in terms of the absolute value of the segment s profit or loss  as a percentage of the greater of  i  the combined profits of all profitable segments and  ii  the absolute amount of  the combined losses of all loss making segments   If after applying these quantitative criteria the combined  revenue from external customers for all reportable segments combined is less than    percent of the total  company revenue the company must identify additional reportable segments until the    percent level is reached   Small segments might be combined as one if they share a substantial number of factors that define a business or  geographical segment or they might be combined with a similar significant reportable segment  Information  about operating segments and businesses that are not reportable is combined in an  all other segments  category 
5,356,Companies may internally report business results in a variety of ways  e g  product segments and geographical  segments   Companies identify the segments for external reporting purposes considering the definition of an  operating segment and using factors such as what information is reported to the board of directors and whether a  manager is responsible for each segment  Companies must disclose the factors used to identify reportable  segments and the types of products and services sold by each reportable segment 
6,356,For each reportable segment the following should also be disclosed 
7,356,  a measure of profit or loss 
8,356,  a measure of total assets and liabilities    if these amounts are regularly reviewed by the company s chief  decision making officer  
9,356,  segment revenue distinguishing between revenue to external customers and revenue from other segments 
10,356,  interest revenue and interest expense 
11,356,  cost of property plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired 
12,356,  depreciation and amortisation expense 
13,356,  other non cash expenses 
14,356,  income tax expense or income  and
15,356,  share of the net profit or loss of an investment accounted for under the equity method 
16,356,Companies also must provide a reconciliation between the information of reportable segments and the  consolidated financial statements in terms of segment revenue profit or loss assets and liabilities 
17,356,Another disclosure required is the company s reliance on any single customer  If any single customer represents     percent or more of the company s total revenues the company must disclose that fact  From an analysts   perspective information about a concentrated customer base can be useful in assessing the risks faced by the  company

32,358,The waters segment  Evian and Volvic  was the most profitable in      as measured by margin and ROA   however in      the segment did not grow as fast as the company s other segments  In      the segment  represented      percent of total segment revenues but in      the percentage was only      percent 
33,358,The company s largest segment by revenue fresh dairy products had the lowest margin in      but a  much higher segment ROA than the baby and medical nutrition segments  Medical nutrition is the second  highest segment in terms of segment margin but lowest in turnover  an indicator of efficiency i e  the  ability to generate revenue from assets   As a result medical nutrition had the lowest segment ROA   Segment ROA   Segment operating income Segment assets    Segment operating income Segment  revenue     Segment revenue Segment Assets    Segment margin   Segment turnover  Reported  percentages may differ due to rounding   Part of the explanation for segment differences in ROA may be  that the medical and baby nutrition businesses were acquired in       In an acquisition the acquiring  company reports the acquired assets at fair value at the time of the acquisition  Most of a company s other  assets are reported at historical costs and over time most long term assets are depreciated  Thus  compared to assets in other segments it is likely that the assets of the nutrition segments are reported at  amounts more reflective of current prices 
34,358,   MODEL BUILDING AND FORECASTING
35,358,Analysts often need to forecast future financial performance  For example EPS forecasts of analysts are widely  followed by Wall Street  Analysts use data about the economy industry and company in arriving at a company s  forecast  The results of an analyst s financial analysis including common size and ratio analyses are integral to  this process along with the judgment of the analysts 
36,358,Based upon forecasts of growth and expected relationships among the financial statement data the analyst can  build a model  sometimes referred to as an  earnings model   to forecast future performance  In addition to  budgets pro forma financial statements are widely used in financial forecasting within companies especially for  use by senior executives and boards of directors  Last but not least these budgets and forecasts are also used in  presentations to credit analysts and others in obtaining external financing

2,359,For example based on a revenue forecast an analyst may budget expenses based on expected common size data   Forecasts of balance sheet and cash flow statements can be derived from expected ratio data such as DSO   Forecasts are not limited to a single point estimate but should involve a range of possibilities  This can involve  several techniques 
3,359,  Sensitivity analysis  Also known as  what if  analysis sensitivity analysis shows the range of possible  outcomes as specific assumptions are changed  this could in turn influence financing needs or investment  in fixed assets 
4,359,  Scenario analysis  This type of analysis shows the changes in key financial quantities that result from  given  economic  events such as the loss of customers the loss of a supply source or a catastrophic event   If the list of events is mutually exclusive and exhaustive and the events can be assigned probabilities the  analyst can evaluate not only the range of outcomes but also standard statistical measures such as the mean  and median value for various quantities of interest 
5,359,  Simulation  This is computer generated sensitivity or scenario analysis based on probability models for  the factors that drive outcomes  Each event or possible outcome is assigned a probability  Multiple  scenarios are then run using the probability factors assigned to the possible values of a variable 
6,359,SUMMARY
7,359,Financial analysis techniques including common size and ratio analysis are useful in summarizing financial  reporting data and evaluating the performance and financial position of a company  The results of financial  analysis techniques provide important inputs into security valuation  Key facets of financial analysis include the  following 
8,359,  Common size financial statements and financial ratios remove the effect of size allowing comparisons of a  company with peer companies  cross sectional analysis  and comparison of a company s results over time   trend or time series analysis  
9,359,  Activity ratios measure the efficiency of a company s operations such as collection of receivables or  management of inventory  Major activity ratios include inventory turnover days of inventory on hand  receivables turnover days of sales outstanding payables turnover number of days of payables working  capital turnover fixed asset turnover and total asset turnover 
10,359,  Liquidity ratios measure the ability of a company to meet short term obligations  Major liquidity ratios  include the current ratio quick ratio cash ratio and defensive interval ratio 
11,359,  Solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to meet long term obligations  Major solvency ratios  include debt ratios  including the debt to assets ratio debt to capital ratio debt to equity ratio and  financial leverage ratio  and coverage ratios  including interest coverage and fixed charge coverage  
12,359,  Profitability ratios measure the ability of a company to generate profits from revenue and assets  Major  profitability ratios include return on sales ratios  including gross profit margin operating profit margin  pretax margin and net profit margin  and return on investment ratios  including operating ROA ROA  return on total capital ROE and return on common equity  
13,359,  Ratios can also be combined and evaluated as a group to better understand how they fit together and how  efficiency and leverage are tied to profitability 
14,359,  ROE can be analyzed as the product of the net profit margin asset turnover and financial leverage  This  decomposition is sometimes referred to as DuPont analysis 
15,359,  Valuation ratios express the relation between the market value of a company or its equity  for example  price per share  and some fundamental financial metric  for example earnings per share  
16,359,  Ratio analysis is useful in the selection and valuation of debt and equity securities and is a part of the credit  rating process

21,365,An analyst is most likely to conclude that 
22,365,A  Company A s ROE is higher than Company B s in FY   and one explanation consistent with the  data is that Company A may have purchased new more efficient equipment 
23,365,B  Company A s ROE is higher than Company B s in FY   and one explanation consistent with the  data is that Company A has made a strategic shift to a product mix with higher profit margins

2,366,C  The difference between the two companies  ROE in FY   is very small and Company A s ROE  remains similar to Company B s ROE mainly due to Company A increasing its financial leverage 
3,366,    What does the P E ratio measure

10,366,C  Return on assets 
11,366,    When developing forecasts analysts should most likely 
12,366,A  develop possibilities relying exclusively on the results of financial analysis 
13,366,B  use the results of financial analysis analysis of other information and judgment 
14,366,C  aim to develop extremely precise forecasts using the results of financial analysis 
15,366,SOLUTIONS
16,366,   C is correct  Cross sectional analysis involves the comparison of companies with each other for the same  time period  Technical analysis uses price and volume data as the basis for investment decisions  Time  series or trend analysis is the comparison of financial data across different time periods 
17,366,   C is correct  Solvency ratios are used to evaluate the ability of a company to meet its long term obligations   An analyst is more likely to use activity ratios to evaluate how efficiently a company uses its assets  An  analyst is more likely to use liquidity ratios to evaluate the ability of a company to meet its short term  obligations 
18,366,   A is correct  The current ratio is a liquidity ratio  It compares the net amount of current assets expected to  be converted into cash within the year with liabilities falling due in the same period  A current ratio of      would indicate that the company would have just enough current assets to pay current liabilities 
19,366,   C is correct  The fixed charge coverage ratio is a coverage ratio that relates known fixed charges or  obligations to a measure of operating profit or cash flow generated by the company  Coverage ratios a  category of solvency ratios measure the ability of a company to cover its payments related to debt and  leases 
20,366,   C is correct  The analyst is unlikely to reach the conclusion given in Statement C because days of sales  outstanding increased from    days in FY  to    days in FY  to    days in FY  indicating that the time  required to collect receivables has increased over the period  This is a negative factor for Spherion s  liquidity  By contrast days of inventory on hand dropped over the period FY  to FY  a positive for  liquidity  The company s increase in days payable from    days to    days shortened its cash conversion  cycle thus also contributing to improved liquidity 
21,366,   A is correct  The company is becoming increasingly less solvent as evidenced by its debt to equity ratio  increasing from      to      from FY  to FY   The amount of a company s debt and equity do not provide  direct information about the company s liquidity position

5,367,   C is correct  The decline in the company s equity indicates that the company may be incurring losses  paying dividends greater than income or repurchasing shares  Recall that Beginning equity   New shares  issuance   Shares repurchased   Comprehensive income   Dividends   Ending equity  The book value of a  company s equity is not affected by changes in the market value of its common stock  An increased amount  of lending does not necessarily indicate that lenders view a company as increasingly creditworthy   Creditworthiness is not evaluated based on how much a company has increased its debt but rather on its  willingness and ability to pay its obligations   Its financial strength is indicated by its solvency liquidity  profitability efficiency and other aspects of credit analysis  
6,367,   C is correct  The company s problems with its inventory management system causing duplicate orders  would likely result in a higher amount of inventory and would therefore result in a decrease in inventory  turnover  A more efficient inventory management system and a write off of inventory at the beginning of  the period would both likely decrease the average inventory for the period  the denominator of the  inventory turnover ratio  thus increasing the ratio rather than decreasing it 
7,367,   B is correct  A write off of receivables would decrease the average amount of accounts receivable  the  denominator of the receivables turnover ratio  thus increasing this ratio  Customers with weaker credit are  more likely to make payments more slowly or to pose collection difficulties which would likely increase  the average amount of accounts receivable and thus decrease receivables turnover  Longer payment terms  would likely increase the average amount of accounts receivable and thus decrease receivables turnover 
8,367,    A is correct  The average accounts receivable balances  actual and desired  must be calculated to determine  the desired change  The average accounts receivable balance can be calculated as an average day s credit  sales times the DSO  For the most recent fiscal year the average accounts receivable balance is         million                            The desired average accounts receivable balance for the next fiscal  year is        million                            This is an increase of       million          million          million   An alternative approach is to calculate the turnover and divide sales by turnover to  determine the average accounts receivable balance  Turnover equals     divided by DSO  Turnover is                   for the most recent fiscal year and is targeted to be                  for the next fiscal  year  The average accounts receivable balances are        million                      and         million                       The change is an increase in receivables of       million
9,367,    A is correct  Company A s current ratio of                       indicates it is more liquid than  Company B whose current ratio is only                        Company B is more solvent as indicated  by its lower debt to equity ratio of    percent                     compared with Company A s debt to  equity ratio of     percent                   
10,367,    C is correct  The company s efficiency deteriorated as indicated by the decline in its total asset turnover  ratio from                                 for FY   to                                    for FY     The decline in the total asset turnover ratio resulted from an increase in average total assets from GBP                          for FY   to GBP        for FY   an increase of     percent compared with an  increase in revenue from GBP     in FY   to GBP      in FY   an increase of only     percent  The  current ratio is not an indicator of efficiency 
11,367,    B is correct  Comparing FY   with FY   the company s solvency deteriorated as indicated by a decrease  in interest coverage from                 in FY   to                  in FY    The debt to asset ratio  increased from                   in FY   to                     in FY    This is also indicative of  deteriorating solvency  In isolation the amount of profits does not provide enough information to assess  solvency 
12,367,    C is correct  Comparing FY   with FY   the company s liquidity improved as indicated by an increase in  its current ratio from                           in FY   to                            in FY    Note  however comparing only current investments with the level of current liabilities shows a decline in  liquidity from                   in FY   to                   in FY    Debt to assets ratio and interest  coverage are measures of solvency not liquidity

2,368,    B is correct  Comparing FY   with FY   the company s profitability deteriorated as indicated by a  decrease in its net profit margin from      percent              to     percent                Debt to  assets ratio is a measure of solvency not an indicator of profitability  Growth in shareholders  equity in  isolation does not provide enough information to assess profitability 
3,368,    C is correct  Assuming no changes in other variables an increase in average assets  an increase in the  denominator  would decrease ROA  A decrease in either the effective tax rate or interest expense assuming  no changes in other variables would increase ROA 
4,368,    C is correct  The company s net profit margin has decreased and its financial leverage has increased  ROA    Net profit margin   Total asset turnover  ROA decreased over the period despite the increase in total  asset turnover  therefore the net profit margin must have decreased 
5,368,ROE   Return on assets   Financial leverage  ROE increased over the period despite the drop in ROA   therefore financial leverage must have increased 
6,368,    C is correct  The increase in the average tax rate in FY   as indicated by the decrease in the value of the  tax burden  the tax burden equals one minus the average tax rate  offset the improvement in efficiency  indicated by higher asset turnover  leaving ROE unchanged  The EBIT margin measuring profitability  was unchanged in FY   and no information is given on liquidity 
7,368,    C is correct  The difference between the two companies  ROE in      is very small and is mainly the result  of Company A s increase in its financial leverage indicated by the increase in its Assets Equity ratio from    to    The impact of efficiency on ROE is identical for the two companies as indicated by both  companies  asset turnover ratios of      Furthermore if Company A had purchased newer equipment to  replace older depreciated equipment then the company s asset turnover ratio  computed as sales assets   would have declined assuming constant sales  Company A has experienced a significant decline in its  operating margin from    percent to   percent which all else equal would not suggest that it is selling  more products with higher profit margins 
8,368,    A is correct  The P E ratio measures the  multiple  that the stock market places on a company s EPS 
9,368,    B is correct  In general a creditor would consider a decrease in debt to total assets as positive news  A  higher level of debt in a company s capital structure increases the risk of default and will in general result  in higher borrowing costs for the company to compensate lenders for assuming greater credit risk  A  decrease in either interest coverage or return on assets is likely to be considered negative news 
10,368,    B is correct  The results of an analyst s financial analysis are integral to the process of developing forecasts  along with the analysis of other information and judgment of the analysts  Forecasts are not limited to a  single point estimate but should involve a range of possibilities 
11,368,NOTES
12,368, The upper limit is equal to the undiscounted sum of the principal and remaining interest payments  i e  the present value of these  contractual payments at a zero percent discount rate  
13,368, Components of this framework have been adapted from van Greuning and Bratanovic       p       and Benninga and Sarig        pp           
14,368, The term  sales  is often used interchangeably with the term  revenues   Other times it is used to refer to revenues derived from sales  of products versus services  The income statement usually reflects  revenues  or  sales  after returns and allowances  e g  returns of  products or discounts offered after a sale to induce the customer to not return a product   Additionally in some countries including the  United Kingdom and South Africa the term  turnover  is used in the sense of  revenue  
15,368, The term vertical analysis is used to denote a common size analysis using only one reporting period or one base financial statement  whereas horizontal analysis refers to an analysis comparing a specific financial statement with prior or future time periods or to a  cross sectional analysis of one company with another 
16,368, In financial statement analysis the term  trend analysis  usually refers to comparisons across time periods of      years not involving  statistical tools  This differs from the use of the term in the quantitative methods portion of the CFA curriculum where  trend analysis   refers to statistical methods of measuring patterns in time series data

2,369, Adapted from Robinson and Munter       pp        
3,369, For computing this ratio an assumption sometimes made is that one third of the lease payment amount represents interest on the lease  obligation and that the rest is a repayment of principal on the obligation  For this variant of the fixed charge coverage ratio the  numerator is EBIT plus one third of lease payments and the denominator is interest payments plus one third of lease payments 
4,369, Note that ratios are expressed in terms of two decimal places and are rounded  Therefore expected relationships may not hold  perfectly 
5,369,  For purposes of analyzing ROE this method usually uses average balance sheet factors  however the math will work out if beginning  or ending balances are used throughout  For certain purposes these alternative methods may be appropriate 
6,369,  Ratios are expressed in terms of two decimal places and are rounded  Therefore ROE may not be the exact product of the three ratios

4,372,   INTRODUCTION
5,372,Merchandising and manufacturing companies generate revenues and profits through the sale of  inventory  Further inventory may represent a significant asset on these companies  balance  sheets  Merchandisers  wholesalers and retailers  purchase inventory ready for sale from  manufacturers and thus account for only one type of inventory finished goods inventory   Manufacturers however purchase raw materials from suppliers and then add value by  transforming the raw materials into finished goods  They typically classify inventory into three  different categories   raw materials work in progress  and finished goods  Work in progress  inventories have started the conversion process from raw materials but are not yet finished  goods ready for sale  Manufacturers may report either the separate carrying amounts of their  raw materials work in progress and finished goods inventories on the balance sheet or simply  the total inventory amount  If the latter approach is used the company must then disclose the  carrying amounts of its raw materials work in progress and finished goods inventories in a  footnote to the financial statements 
6,372,Inventories and cost of sales  cost of goods sold   are significant items in the financial  statements of many companies  Comparing the performance of these companies is challenging  because of the allowable choices for valuing inventories  Differences in the choice of inventory  valuation method can result in significantly different amounts being assigned to inventory and  cost of sales  Financial statement analysis would be much easier if all companies used the same  inventory valuation method or if inventory price levels remained constant over time  If there  was no inflation or deflation with respect to inventory costs and thus unit costs were unchanged  the choice of inventory valuation method would be irrelevant  However inventory price levels  typically do change over time

2,373,International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  permit the assignment of inventory costs   costs of goods available for sale  to inventories and cost of sales by three cost formulas   specific identification first in first out  FIFO  and weighted average cost   US generally  accepted accounting principles  US GAAP  allow the same three inventory valuation methods  referred to as cost flow assumptions in US GAAP but also include a fourth method called last  in first out  LIFO    The choice of inventory valuation method affects the allocation of the cost  of goods available for sale to ending inventory and cost of sales  Analysts must understand the  various inventory valuation methods and the related impact on financial statements and  financial ratios in order to evaluate a company s performance over time and relative to industry  peers  The company s financial statements and related notes provide important information that  the analyst can use in assessing the impact of the choice of inventory valuation method on  financial statements and financial ratios 
3,373,This reading is organized as follows  Section   discusses the costs that are included in inventory  and the costs that are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred  Section    describes inventory valuation methods and compares the measurement of ending inventory cost  of sales and gross profit under each method and when using periodic versus perpetual  inventory systems  Section   describes the LIFO method LIFO reserve and effects of LIFO  liquidations and demonstrates the adjustments required to compare a company that uses LIFO  with one that uses FIFO  Section   describes the financial statement effects of a change in  inventory valuation method  Section   discusses the measurement and reporting of inventory  when its value changes  Section   describes the presentation of inventories on the financial  statements and related disclosures discusses inventory ratios and their interpretation and shows  examples of financial analysis with respect to inventories  A summary and practice problems  conclude the reading 
4,373,   COST OF INVENTORIES
5,373,Under IFRS the costs to include in inventories are  all costs of purchase costs of conversion  and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition    The costs of purchase include the purchase price import and tax related duties transport  insurance during transport handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of  finished goods materials and services  Trade discounts rebates and similar items reduce the  price paid and the costs of purchase  The costs of conversion include costs directly related to the  units produced such as direct labour and fixed and variable overhead costs   Including these  product related costs in inventory  i e  as an asset  means that they will not be recognised as an  expense  i e  as cost of sales  on the income statement until the inventory is sold  US GAAP  provide a similar description of the costs to be included in inventory

2,374,Both IFRS and US GAAP exclude the following costs from inventory  abnormal costs incurred  as a result of waste of materials labour or other production conversion inputs any storage costs   unless required as part of the production process  and all administrative overhead and selling  costs  These excluded costs are treated as expenses and recognised on the income statement in  the period in which they are incurred  Including costs in inventory defers their recognition as an  expense on the income statement until the inventory is sold  Therefore including costs in  inventory that should be expensed will overstate profitability on the income statement  because  of the inappropriate deferral of cost recognition  and create an overstated inventory value on the  balance sheet

2,375,   INVENTORY VALUATION METHODS
3,375,Generally inventory purchase costs and manufacturing conversion costs change over time  As a  result the allocation of total inventory costs  i e  cost of goods available for sale  between cost  of sales on the income statement and inventory on the balance sheet will vary depending on the  inventory valuation method used by the company  As mentioned in the introduction inventory  valuation methods are referred to as cost formulas and cost flow assumptions under IFRS and  US GAAP respectively  If the choice of method results in more cost being allocated to cost of  sales and less cost being allocated to inventory than would be the case with other methods the  chosen method will cause in the current year reported gross profit net income and inventory  carrying amount to be lower than if alternative methods had been used  Accounting for  inventory and consequently the allocation of costs thus has a direct impact on financial  statements and their comparability 
4,375,Both IFRS and US GAAP allow companies to use the following inventory valuation methods   specific identification  first in first out  FIFO   and weighted average cost  US GAAP allow  companies to use an additional method  last in first out  LIFO   A company must use the same  inventory valuation method for all items that have a similar nature and use  For items with a  different nature or use a different inventory valuation method can be used   When items are  sold the carrying amount of the inventory is recognised as an expense  cost of sales  according  to the cost formula  cost flow assumption  in use 
5,375,Specific identification is used for inventory items that are not ordinarily interchangeable  whereas FIFO weighted average cost and LIFO are typically used when there are large  numbers of interchangeable items in inventory  Specific identification matches the actual  historical costs of the specific inventory items to their physical flow  the costs remain in  inventory until the actual identifiable inventory is sold  FIFO weighted average cost and LIFO  are based on cost flow assumptions  Under these methods companies must make certain  assumptions about which goods are sold and which goods remain in ending inventory  As a  result the allocation of costs to the units sold and to the units in ending inventory can be  different from the physical movement of the items 
6,375,The choice of inventory valuation method would be largely irrelevant if inventory costs  remained constant or relatively constant over time  Given relatively constant prices the  allocation of costs between cost of goods sold and ending inventory would be very similar  under each of the four methods  Given changing price levels however the choice of inventory  valuation method can have a significant impact on the amount of reported cost of sales and  inventory  And the reported cost of sales and inventory balances affect other items such as  gross profit net income current assets and total assets

2,376,     Specific Identification
3,376,The specific identification method is used for inventory items that are not ordinarily  interchangeable and for goods that have been produced and segregated for specific projects   This method is also commonly used for expensive goods that are uniquely identifiable such as  precious gemstones  Under this method the cost of sales and the cost of ending inventory  reflect the actual costs incurred to purchase  or manufacture  the items specifically identified as  sold and the items specifically identified as remaining in inventory  Therefore this method  matches the physical flow of the specific items sold and remaining in inventory to their actual  cost 
4,376,     First In First Out  FIFO 
5,376,FIFO assumes that the oldest goods purchased  or manufactured  are sold first and the newest  goods purchased  or manufactured  remain in ending inventory  In other words the first units  included in inventory are assumed to be the first units sold from inventory  Therefore cost of  sales reflects the cost of goods in beginning inventory plus the cost of items purchased  or  manufactured  earliest in the accounting period and the value of ending inventory reflects the  costs of goods purchased  or manufactured  more recently  In periods of rising prices the costs  assigned to the units in ending inventory are higher than the costs assigned to the units sold   Conversely in periods of declining prices the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory  are lower than the costs assigned to the units sold 
6,376,     Weighted Average Cost
7,376,Weighted average cost assigns the average cost of the goods available for sale  beginning  inventory plus purchase conversion and other costs  during the accounting period to the units  that are sold as well as to the units in ending inventory  In an accounting period the weighted  average cost per unit is calculated as the total cost of the units available for sale divided by the  total number of units available for sale in the period  Total cost of goods available for sale Total  units available for sale  
8,376,     Last In First Out  LIFO 
9,376,LIFO is permitted only under US GAAP  This method assumes that the newest goods  purchased  or manufactured  are sold first and the oldest goods purchased  or manufactured   including beginning inventory remain in ending inventory  In other words the last units  included in inventory are assumed to be the first units sold from inventory  Therefore cost of  sales reflects the cost of goods purchased  or manufactured  more recently and the value of  ending inventory reflects the cost of older goods  In periods of rising prices the costs assigned  to the units in ending inventory are lower than the costs assigned to the units sold  Conversely  in periods of declining prices the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory are higher than  the costs assigned to the units sold

2,377,     Calculation of Cost of Sales Gross Profit and Ending  Inventory
3,377,In periods of changing prices the allocation of total inventory costs  i e  cost of goods available  for sale  between cost of sales on the income statement and inventory on the balance sheet will  vary depending on the inventory valuation method used by the company  The following  example illustrates how cost of sales gross profit and ending inventory differ based on the  choice of inventory valuation method

2,378,Note that in spite of the segregation of inventory within the warehouse it would be  inappropriate to use specific identification for this inventory of interchangeable items   The use of specific identification could potentially result in earnings manipulation  through the shipment decision 
3,378,Solution to   
4,378,Under the weighted average cost method costs are allocated to cost of sales and ending  inventory by using a weighted average mix of the actual costs incurred for all inventory  items  The weighted average cost per unit is determined by dividing the total cost of  goods available for sale by the number of units available for sale

2,379,The following table  in thousands of yuan  summarizes the cost of sales the ending  inventory and the cost of goods available for sale that were calculated for each of the  four inventory valuation methods  Note that in the first year of operation the total cost  of goods available for sale is the same under all four methods  Subsequently the cost of  goods available for sale will typically differ because beginning inventories will differ   Also shown is the gross profit figure for each of the four methods  Because the cost of a  kg of soap declined over the period LIFO had the highest ending inventory amount the  lowest cost of sales and the highest gross profit  FIFO had the lowest ending inventory  amount the highest cost of sales and the lowest gross profit

12,379,     Periodic versus Perpetual Inventory Systems
13,379,Companies typically record changes to inventory using either a periodic inventory system or a  perpetual inventory system  Under a periodic inventory system inventory values and costs of  sales are determined at the end of an accounting period  Purchases are recorded in a purchases  account  The total of purchases and beginning inventory is the amount of goods available for  sale during the period  The ending inventory amount is subtracted from the goods available for  sale to arrive at the cost of sales  The quantity of goods in ending inventory is usually obtained  or verified through a physical count of the units in inventory  Under a perpetual inventory  system inventory values and cost of sales are continuously updated to reflect purchases and  sales 
14,379,Under either system the allocation of goods available for sale to cost of sales and ending  inventory is the same if the inventory valuation method used is either specific identification or  FIFO  This is not generally true for the weighted average cost method  Under a periodic  inventory system the amount of cost of goods available for sale allocated to cost of sales and  ending inventory may be quite different using the FIFO method compared to the weighted  average cost method  Under a perpetual inventory system inventory values and cost of sales are  continuously updated to reflect purchases and sales  As a result the amount of cost of goods  available for sale allocated to cost of sales and ending inventory is similar under the FIFO and  weighted average cost methods  Because of lack of disclosure and the dominance of perpetual  inventory systems analysts typically do not make adjustments when comparing a company  using the weighted average cost method with a company using the FIFO method

2,380,Using the LIFO method the periodic and perpetual inventory systems will generally result in  different allocations to cost of sales and ending inventory  Under either a perpetual or periodic  inventory system the use of the LIFO method will generally result in significantly different  allocations to cost of sales and ending inventory compared to other inventory valuation  methods  When inventory costs are increasing and inventory unit levels are stable or increasing  using the LIFO method will result in higher cost of sales and lower inventory carrying amounts  than using the FIFO method  The higher cost of sales under LIFO will result in lower gross  profit operating income income before taxes and net income  Income tax expense will be  lower under LIFO causing the company s net operating cash flow to be higher  On the balance  sheet the lower inventory carrying amount will result in lower reported current assets working  capital and total assets  Analysts must carefully assess the financial statement implications of  the choice of inventory valuation method when comparing companies that use the LIFO method  with companies that use the FIFO method

2,381,The amounts for total goods available for sale and sales are the same under either the  perpetual or periodic system in this first year of operation  The carrying amount of the  ending inventory however may differ because the perpetual system will apply LIFO  continuously throughout the year  Under the periodic system it was assumed that the  ending inventory was composed of       units of the oldest inventory which cost      yuan kg

5,382,In this example the ending inventory amount is lower under the perpetual system  because only       kg of the oldest inventory with the highest cost is assumed to  remain in inventory  The cost of sales is higher and the gross profit is lower under the  perpetual system compared to the periodic system 
6,382,     Comparison of Inventory Valuation Methods
7,382,As shown in Example   the allocation of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of  sales on the income statement and to ending inventory on the balance sheet varies under the  different inventory valuation methods  In an environment of declining inventory unit costs and  constant or increasing inventory quantities FIFO  in comparison with weighted average cost or  LIFO  will allocate a higher amount of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of sales  on the income statement and a lower amount to ending inventory on the balance sheet   Accordingly because cost of sales will be higher under FIFO a company s gross profit  operating profit and income before taxes will be lower 
8,382,Conversely in an environment of rising inventory unit costs and constant or increasing  inventory quantities FIFO  in comparison with weighted average cost or LIFO  will allocate a  lower amount of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of sales on the income  statement and a higher amount to ending inventory on the balance sheet  Accordingly because  cost of sales will be lower under FIFO a company s gross profit operating profit and income  before taxes will be higher 
9,382,The carrying amount of inventories under FIFO will more closely reflect current replacement  values because inventories are assumed to consist of the most recently purchased items  The  cost of sales under LIFO will more closely reflect current replacement value  LIFO ending  inventory amounts are typically not reflective of current replacement value because the ending  inventory is assumed to be the oldest inventory and costs are allocated accordingly  Example   illustrates the different results obtained by using either the FIFO or LIFO methods to account  for inventory

23,384,Inventory turnover ratio   Cost of sales   Ending inventory  The inventory turnover  ratio increased each year for both companies because the units sold increased whereas  the units in ending inventory remained unchanged  The increase in the inventory  turnover ratio is higher for Company L because Company L s cost of sales is increasing  for inflation but the inventory carrying amount is unaffected by inflation  It might  appear that a company using the LIFO method manages its inventory more effectively  but this is deceptive  Both companies have identical quantities and prices of purchases  and sales and only differ in the inventory valuation method used 
24,384,Gross profit margin   Gross profit   Sales  The gross profit margin is stable under LIFO  because both sales and cost of sales increase at the same rate of inflation  The gross  profit margin is slightly higher under the FIFO method after the first year because a  proportion of the cost of sales reflects an older purchase price

2,385,   THE LIFO METHOD
3,385,In the United States the LIFO method is widely used  approximately    percent of US  companies use the LIFO method   The potential income tax savings are a benefit of using the  LIFO method when inventory costs are increasing  The higher cash flows due to lower income  taxes may make the company more valuable because the value of a company is based on the  present value of its future cash flows  Under the  LIFO conformity rule  the US tax code  requires that companies using the LIFO method for tax purposes must also use the LIFO  method for financial reporting  Under the LIFO method ending inventory is assumed to consist  of those units that have been held the longest  This generally results in ending inventories with  carrying amounts lower than current replacement costs because inventory costs typically  increase over time  Cost of sales will more closely reflect current replacement costs 
4,385,If the purchase prices  purchase costs  or production costs of inventory are increasing the  income statement consequences of using the LIFO method compared to other methods will  include higher cost of sales and lower gross profit operating profit income tax expense and  net income  The balance sheet consequences include lower ending inventory working capital  total assets retained earnings and shareholders  equity  The lower income tax paid will result  in higher net cash flow from operating activities  Some of the financial ratio effects are a lower  current ratio higher debt to equity ratios and lower profitability ratios 
5,385,If the purchase prices or production costs of inventory are decreasing it is unlikely that a  company will use the LIFO method for tax purposes  and therefore for financial reporting  purposes due to the LIFO conformity rule  because this will result in lower cost of sales and  higher taxable income and income taxes  However if the company had elected to use the LIFO  method and cannot justify changing the inventory valuation method for tax and financial  reporting purposes when inventory costs begin to decrease the income statement balance sheet  and ratio effects will be opposite to the effects during a period of increasing costs 
6,385,The US Securities Exchange Commission  SEC  has proposed the full adoption of IFRS by all  US reporting companies beginning in       An important consequence of this proposal would  be the complete elimination of the LIFO inventory method for financial reporting and due to  the LIFO conformity rule tax reporting by US companies  As a consequence of the restatement  of financial statements to the FIFO or weighted average cost method significant immediate  income tax liabilities may arise in the year of transition from the LIFO method to either the  FIFO or weighted average cost method 
7,385,     LIFO Reserve
8,385,For companies using the LIFO method US GAAP requires disclosure in the notes to the  financial statements or on the balance sheet of the amount of the LIFO reserve  The LIFO  reserve is the difference between the reported LIFO inventory carrying amount and the  inventory amount that would have been reported if the FIFO method had been used  in other  words the FIFO inventory value less the LIFO inventory value   The disclosure provides the  information that analysts need to adjust a company s cost of sales  cost of goods sold  and  ending inventory balance based on the LIFO method to the FIFO method

2,386,To compare companies using LIFO with companies not using LIFO inventory is adjusted by  adding the disclosed LIFO reserve to the inventory balance that is reported on the balance sheet   The reported inventory balance using LIFO plus the LIFO reserve equals the inventory that  would have been reported under FIFO  Cost of sales is adjusted by subtracting the increase in  the LIFO reserve during the period from the cost of sales amount that is reported on the income  statement  If the LIFO reserve has declined during the period   the decrease in the reserve is  added to the cost of sales amount that is reported on the income statement  The LIFO reserve  disclosure can be used to adjust the financial statements of a US company using the LIFO  method to make them comparable with a similar company using the FIFO method

2,390,Solution to   
3,390,Assuming tax rates of    percent for      and    percent for earlier years the  cumulative amount of income tax savings that CAT has generated by using the LIFO  method instead of FIFO is approximately      million                            Note   D indicates a LIFO reserve of       million at the end of      and an increase  in the LIFO reserve of      million in       Therefore under the FIFO method  cumulative gross profits would have been       million higher as of the end of       and an additional      million higher as of the end of       The estimated tax savings  would be higher  lower  if income tax rates were assumed to be higher  lower  
4,390,Solution to   
5,390,The amount that would be added to CAT s retained earnings is       million               or                           This represents the cumulative increase in  operating profit due to the decrease in cost of goods sold  LIFO reserve of        million  less the assumed taxes on that profit       million see solution to   above    Some analysts advocate ignoring the tax consequences and suggest simply adjusting  inventory and equity by the same amount  They argue that the reported equity of the  firm is understated by the difference between the current value of its inventory   approximated by the value under FIFO  and its carrying value  value under LIFO  
6,390,Solution to   
7,390,Under the FIFO method an additional      million is assumed to have been incurred  for tax expenses  If CAT switched to FIFO it would have an additional tax liability of       million as a consequence of the restatement of financial statements to the FIFO  method  This illustrates the significant immediate income tax liabilities that may arise in  the year of transition from the LIFO method to the FIFO method  If CAT switched to  FIFO for tax purposes there would be a cash outflow for the additional taxes  However  because the company is not actually converting at this point for either tax or reporting  purposes it is appropriate to reflect a deferred tax liability rather than a reduction in  cash  In this case for analysis purposes under FIFO inventory would increase by        million equity by       million and non current liabilities by      million

4,391,The ratio is higher under LIFO because given rising inventory costs cost of goods sold  will be higher and inventory carrying amounts will be lower under LIFO  If an analyst  made no adjustment for the difference in inventory methods it might appear that a  company using the LIFO method manages its inventory more effectively

3,392,The total assets under FIFO are the LIFO total assets increased by the LIFO reserve  The  return on assets is lower under LIFO because the lower net income due to the higher  cost of goods sold has a greater impact on the ratio than the lower total assets which are  the result of lower inventory carrying amounts  The company appears to be less  profitable under LIFO

11,392,The ratio is higher under LIFO because the addition to retained earnings under FIFO  reduces the ratio  The company appears to be more highly leveraged under LIFO 
12,392,In summary the company appears to be less profitable less liquid and more highly  leveraged under LIFO  Yet because a company s value is based on the present value of  future cash flows LIFO will increase the company s value because the cash flows are  higher in earlier years due to lower taxes  LIFO is primarily used for the tax benefits it  provides 
13,392,     LIFO Liquidations
14,392,In periods of rising inventory unit costs the carrying amount of inventory under FIFO will  always exceed the carrying amount of inventory under LIFO  The LIFO reserve may increase  over time as the result of the increasing difference between the older costs used to value  inventory under LIFO and the more recent costs used to value inventory under FIFO  Also  when the number of inventory units manufactured or purchased exceeds the number of units  sold the LIFO reserve may increase as the result of the addition of new LIFO layers  the  quantity of inventory units is increasing and each increase in quantity creates a new LIFO  layer

2,393,When the number of units sold exceeds the number of units purchased or manufactured the  number of units in ending inventory is lower than the number of units in beginning inventory  and a company using LIFO will experience a LIFO liquidation  some of the older units held in  inventory are assumed to have been sold   If inventory unit costs have been rising from period  to period and LIFO liquidation occurs this will produce an inventory related increase in gross  profits  The increase in gross profits occurs because of the lower inventory carrying amounts of  the liquidated units  The lower inventory carrying amounts are used for cost of sales and the  sales are at the current prices  The gross profit on these units is higher than the gross profit that  would be recognised using more current costs  These inventory profits caused by a LIFO  liquidation however are one time events and are not sustainable 
3,393,LIFO liquidations can occur for a variety of reasons  The reduction in inventory levels may be  outside of management s control  for example labour strikes at a supplier may force a company  to reduce inventory levels to meet customer demands  In periods of economic recession or when  customer demand is declining a company may choose to reduce existing inventory levels rather  than invest in new inventory  Analysts should be aware that management can potentially  manipulate and inflate their company s reported gross profits and net income at critical times by  intentionally reducing inventory quantities and liquidating older layers of LIFO inventory   selling some units of beginning inventory   During economic downturns LIFO liquidation may  result in higher gross profit than would otherwise be realised  If LIFO layers of inventory are  temporarily depleted and not replaced by fiscal year end LIFO liquidation will occur resulting  in unsustainable higher gross profits  Therefore it is imperative to review the LIFO reserve  footnote disclosures to determine if LIFO liquidation has occurred  A decline in the LIFO  reserve from the prior period may be indicative of LIFO liquidation

2,395,Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally determined by the last in first out   LIFO  method or market  If inventories had been valued using the first in first out  method inventory values would have been higher by approximately       million and        million at December         and      respectively  During      and       inventory quantities were reduced  This reduction resulted in a liquidation of LIFO  inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the  current cost of purchases the effect of which decreased costs of products sold by  approximately       million and      million in      and      respectively  There was  no LIFO liquidation in      
3,395,   What is the decrease in the LIFO reserve on the balance sheet  How much less  was the cost of products sold in      because of LIFO liquidation according to  the note disclosure

2,397,Companies on rare occasion change inventory valuation methods  Under IFRS a change in  method is acceptable only if the change  results in the financial statements providing reliable  and more relevant information about the effects of transactions other events or conditions on  the business entity s financial position financial performance or cash flows     If the change is  justifiable then it is applied retrospectively 
3,397,This means that the change is applied to comparative information for prior periods as far back  as is practicable  The cumulative amount of the adjustments relating to periods prior to those  presented in the current financial statements is made to the opening balance of each affected  component of equity  i e  retained earnings or comprehensive income  of the earliest period  presented  For example if a company changes its inventory method in      and it presents  three years of comparative financial statements            and       in its annual report it  would retrospectively reflect this change as far back as possible  The change would be reflected  in the three years of financial statements presented  the financial statements for      and       would be restated as if the new method had been used in these periods and the cumulative  effect of the change on periods prior to      would be reflected in the      opening balance of  each affected component of equity  An exemption to the restatement applies when it is  impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the  change 
4,397,Under US GAAP the conditions to make a change in accounting policy and the accounting for  a change in inventory policy are similar to IFRS    US GAAP however requires companies to  thoroughly explain why the newly adopted inventory accounting method is superior and  preferable to the old method  If a company decides to change from LIFO to another inventory  method US GAAP requires a retrospective restatement as described above  However if a  company decides to change to the LIFO method it must do so on a prospective basis and  retrospective adjustments are not made to the financial statements  The carrying amount of  inventory under the old method becomes the initial LIFO layer in the year of LIFO adoption 
5,397,Analysts should carefully evaluate changes in inventory valuation methods  Although the stated  reason for the inventory change may be to better match inventory costs with sales revenue  or  some other plausible business explanation  the real underlying  and unstated  purpose may be  to reduce income tax expense  if changing to LIFO from FIFO or average cost  or to increase  reported profits  if changing from LIFO to FIFO or average cost   As always the choice of  inventory valuation method can have a significant impact on financial statements and the  financial ratios that are derived from them  As a consequence analysts must carefully consider  the impact of the change in inventory valuation methods and the differences in inventory  valuation methods when comparing a company s performance with that of its industry or its  competitors

2,398,   INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS
3,398,Significant financial risk can result from the holding of inventory  The cost of inventory may  not be recoverable due to spoilage obsolescence or declines in selling prices  IFRS state that  inventories shall be measured  and carried on the balance sheet  at the lower of cost and net  realisable value    Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of  business less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale and estimated costs to get the  inventory in condition for sale  The assessment of net realisable value is typically done item by  item or by groups of similar or related items  In the event that the value of inventory declines  below the carrying amount on the balance sheet the inventory carrying amount must be written  down to its net realisable value   and the loss  reduction in value  recognised as an expense on  the income statement  This expense may be included as part of cost of sales or reported  separately 
4,398,In each subsequent period a new assessment of net realisable value is made  Reversal  limited  to the amount of the original write down  is required for a subsequent increase in value of  inventory previously written down  The reversal of any write down of inventories is recognised  as a reduction in cost of sales  reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense  
5,398,US GAAP used to specify the lower of cost or market to value inventories    For fiscal years  beginning after December         inventories measured using other than LIFO and retail  inventory methods are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value  This is broadly  consistent with IFRS with one major difference  US GAAP prohibit the reversal of write  downs  For inventories measured using LIFO and retail inventory methods market value is  defined as current replacement cost subject to upper and lower limits  Market value cannot  exceed net realisable value  selling price less reasonably estimated costs of completion and  disposal   The lower limit of market value is net realisable value less a normal profit margin   Any write down to market value or net realisable value reduces the value of the inventory and  the loss in value  expense  is generally reflected in the income statement in cost of goods sold 
6,398,An inventory write down reduces both profit and the carrying amount of inventory on the  balance sheet and thus has a negative effect on profitability liquidity and solvency ratios   However activity ratios  for example inventory turnover and total asset turnover  will be  positively affected by a write down because the asset base  denominator  is reduced  The  negative impact on some key ratios due to the decrease in profit may result in the reluctance  by some companies to record inventory write downs unless there is strong evidence that the  decline in the value of inventory is permanent  This is especially true under US GAAP where  reversal of a write down is prohibited

2,399,IAS    Inventories  does not apply to the inventories of producers of agricultural and forest  products and minerals and mineral products nor to commodity broker traders  These  inventories may be measured at net realisable value  fair value less costs to sell and complete   according to well established industry practices  If an active market exists for these products  the quoted market price in that market is the appropriate basis for determining the fair value of  that asset  If an active market does not exist a company may use market determined prices or  values  such as the most recent market transaction price  when available for determining fair  value  Changes in the value of inventory  increase or decrease  are recognised in profit or loss  in the period of the change  US GAAP is similar to IFRS in its treatment of inventories of  agricultural and forest products and mineral ores  Mark to market inventory accounting is  allowed for bullion

5,399,Acme Enterprises a hypothetical company manufactures computers and prepares its  financial statements in accordance with IFRS  In      the cost of ending inventory was       million but its net realisable value was      million  The current replacement cost  of the inventory is      million  This figure exceeds the net realisable value less a  normal profit margin  In      the net realisable value of Acme s inventory was       million greater than the carrying amount

7,399,   Under US GAAP if Acme used the LIFO method what would be the effects of  the write down on Acme s      financial statements and of the recovery on  Acme s      financial statements 
8,399,   What would be the effect of the recovery on Acme s      financial statements if  Acme s inventory were agricultural products instead of computers 
9,399,Solution to   
10,399,For      Acme would write its inventory down to      million and record the change  in value of      million as an expense on the income statement  For      Acme would  increase the carrying amount of its inventory and reduce the cost of sales by      million   the recovery is limited to the amount of the original write down  
11,399,Solution to   
12,399,Under US GAAP for      Acme would write its inventory down to      million and  typically include the change in value of      million in cost of goods sold on the income  statement  For      Acme would not reverse the write down

3,400,If Acme s inventory were agricultural products instead of computers inventory would  be measured at net realisable value and Acme would therefore increase inventory by  and record a gain of      million for      
4,400,Analysts should consider the possibility of an inventory write down because the impact on a  company s financial ratios may be substantial  The potential for inventory write downs can be  high for companies in industries where technological obsolescence of inventories is a  significant risk  Analysts should carefully evaluate prospective inventory impairments  as well  as other potential asset impairments  and their potential effects on the financial ratios when debt  covenants include financial ratio requirements  The breaching of debt covenants can have a  significant impact on a company 
5,400,Companies that use specific identification weighted average cost or FIFO methods are more  likely to incur inventory write downs than companies that use the LIFO method  Under the  LIFO method the oldest costs are reflected in the inventory carrying amount on the balance  sheet  Given increasing inventory costs the inventory carrying amounts under the LIFO method  are already conservatively presented at the oldest and lowest costs  Thus it is far less likely that  inventory write downs will occur under LIFO and if a write down does occur it is likely to be  of a lesser magnitude

2,406,The profitability ratios  gross profit margin and net profit margin  for Volvo Group  would have been slightly better  higher  for      if the company had not recorded  inventory write downs  The activity ratio  inventory turnover ratio  would appear less  attractive without the write downs  The inventory turnover ratio is slightly better   higher  with inventory write downs because inventory write downs increase cost of  sales  numerator  and decrease the average inventory  denominator  making inventory  management appear more efficient with write downs 
3,406,Solution to   
4,406,CAT uses the LIFO method whereas Volvo uses the FIFO method  Given increasing  inventory costs companies that use the FIFO inventory method are far more likely to  incur inventory write downs than those companies that use the LIFO method  This is  because under the LIFO method the inventory carrying amounts reflect the oldest costs  and therefore the lowest costs given increasing inventory costs  Because inventory  carrying amounts under the LIFO method are already conservatively presented it is less  likely that inventory write downs will occur 
5,406,   EVALUATION OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
6,406,The choice of inventory valuation method impacts the financial statements  The financial  statement items impacted include cost of sales gross profit net income inventories current  assets and total assets  Therefore the choice of inventory valuation method also affects  financial ratios that contain these items  Ratios such as current ratio return on assets gross  profit margin and inventory turnover are impacted  As a consequence analysts must carefully  consider inventory valuation method differences when evaluating a company s performance  over time or when comparing its performance with the performance of the industry or industry  competitors  Additionally the financial statement items and ratios may be impacted by  adjustments of inventory carrying amounts to net realisable value or current replacement cost 
7,406,     Presentation and Disclosure
8,406,Disclosures are useful when analyzing a company  IFRS require the following financial  statement disclosures concerning inventory 
9,406,a  the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories including the cost formula   inventory valuation method  used 
10,406,b  the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications  for  example merchandise raw materials production supplies work in progress and finished  goods  appropriate to the entity 
11,406,c  the carrying amount of inventories carried at fair value less costs to sell 
12,406,d  the amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the period  cost of sales

2,407,e  the amount of any write down of inventories recognised as an expense in the period 
3,407,f  the amount of any reversal of any write down that is recognised as a reduction in cost of  sales in the period 
4,407,g  the circumstances or events that led to the reversal of a write down of inventories  and
5,407,h  the carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities 
6,407,Inventory related disclosures under US GAAP are very similar to the disclosures above except  that requirements  f  and  g  are not relevant because US GAAP do not permit the reversal of  prior year inventory write downs  US GAAP also require disclosure of significant estimates  applicable to inventories and of any material amount of income resulting from the liquidation of  LIFO inventory 
7,407,     Inventory Ratios
8,407,Three ratios often used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of inventory management
9,407,are inventory turnover days of inventory on hand and gross profit margin    These
10,407,ratios are directly impacted by a company s choice of inventory valuation method  Analysts  should be aware however that many other ratios are also affected by the choice of inventory  valuation method although less directly  These include the current ratio because inventory is a  component of current assets  the return on assets ratio because cost of sales is a key component  in deriving net income and inventory is a component of total assets  and even the debt to equity  ratio because the cumulative measured net income from the inception of a business is an  aggregate component of retained earnings 
11,407,The inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times during the year a company sells   i e  turns over  its inventory  The higher the turnover ratio the more times that inventory is  sold during the year and the lower the relative investment of resources in inventory  Days of  inventory on hand can be calculated as days in the period divided by inventory turnover  Thus  inventory turnover and days of inventory on hand are inversely related  It may be that inventory  turnover however is calculated using average inventory in the year whereas days of inventory  on hand is based on the ending inventory amount  In general inventory turnover and the  number of days of inventory on hand should be benchmarked against industry norms and  compared across years 
12,407,A high inventory turnover ratio and a low number of days of inventory on hand might indicate  highly effective inventory management  Alternatively a high inventory ratio and a low number  of days of inventory on hand could indicate that the company does not carry an adequate  amount of inventory or that the company has written down inventory values  Inventory  shortages could potentially result in lost sales or production problems in the case of the raw  materials inventory of a manufacturer  To assess which explanation is more likely analysts can  compare the company s inventory turnover and sales growth rate with those of the industry and  review financial statement disclosures  Slower growth combined with higher inventory turnover  could indicate inadequate inventory levels  Write downs of inventory could reflect poor  inventory management  Minimal write downs and sales growth rates at or above the industry s  growth rates would support the interpretation that the higher turnover reflects greater efficiency  in managing inventory

2,408,A low inventory turnover ratio and a high number of days of inventory on hand relative to  industry norms could be an indicator of slow moving or obsolete inventory  Again comparing  the company s sales growth across years and with the industry and reviewing financial  statement disclosures can provide additional insight 
3,408,The gross profit margin the ratio of gross profit to sales indicates the percentage of sales being  contributed to net income as opposed to covering the cost of sales  Firms in highly competitive  industries generally have lower gross profit margins than firms in industries with fewer  competitors  A company s gross profit margin may be a function of its type of product  A  company selling luxury products will generally have higher gross profit margins than a  company selling staple products  The inventory turnover of the company selling luxury  products however is likely to be much lower than the inventory turnover of the company  selling staple products 
4,408,     Financial Analysis Illustrations
5,408,IFRS and US GAAP require companies to disclose either on the balance sheet or in the notes to  the financial statements the carrying amounts of inventories in classifications suitable to the  company  For manufacturing companies these classifications might include production  supplies raw materials work in progress and finished goods  For a retailer these  classifications might include significant categories of merchandise or the grouping of  inventories with similar attributes  These disclosures may provide signals about a company s  future sales and profits 
6,408,For example a significant increase  attributable to increases in unit volume rather than  increases in unit cost  in raw materials and or work in progress inventories may signal that the  company expects an increase in demand for its products  This suggests an anticipated increase  in sales and profit  However a substantial increase in finished goods inventories while raw  materials and work in progress inventories are declining may signal a decrease in demand for  the company s products and hence lower future sales and profit  This may also signal a potential  future write down of finished goods inventory  Irrespective of the signal an analyst should  thoroughly investigate the underlying reasons for any significant changes in a company s raw  materials work in progress and finished goods inventories 
7,408,Analysts also should compare the growth rate of a company s sales to the growth rate of its  finished goods inventories because this could also provide a signal about future sales and  profits  For example if the growth of inventories is greater than the growth of sales this could  indicate a decline in demand and a decrease in future earnings  The company may have to lower   mark down  the selling price of its products to reduce its inventory balances or it may have to  write down the value of its inventory because of obsolescence both of which would negatively  affect profits  Besides the potential for mark downs or write downs having too much inventory  on hand or the wrong type of inventory can have a negative financial effect on a company  because it increases inventory related expenses such as insurance storage costs and taxes  In  addition it means that the company has less cash and working capital available to use for other  purposes

2,409,Inventory write downs may have a substantial impact on a company s activity profitability  liquidity and solvency ratios  It is critical for the analyst to be aware of industry trends toward  product obsolescence and to analyze the financial ratios for their sensitivity to potential  inventory impairment  Companies can minimise the impact of inventory write downs by better  matching their inventory composition and growth with prospective customer demand  To obtain  additional information about a company s inventory and its future sales a variety of sources of  information are available  Analysts should consider the Management Discussion and Analysis   MD A  or similar sections of the company s financial reports industry related news and  publications and industry economic data 
3,409,When conducting comparisons differences in the choice of inventory valuation method can  significantly affect the comparability of financial ratios between companies  A restatement from  the LIFO method to the FIFO method is critical to make a valid comparison with companies  using a method other than the LIFO method such as those companies reporting under IFRS   Analysts should seek out as much information as feasible when analyzing the performance of  companies

7,410,Comparing CAT  FIFO  and Volvo it appears that Volvo manages its inventory more  effectively  It has higher inventory turnover and less days of inventory on hand  CAT  appears to have superior profitability based on net profit margins  CAT did report some  losses as other comprehensive income in the balance sheet  see Exhibit    as indicated  by the absolute increase in the negative accumulated other comprehensive income  The  absolute increase in the negative accumulated other comprehensive income results in a  reduction of shareholders  equity which makes CAT s return on equity higher  The  higher leverage of CAT also increases the return on equity  The sources of CAT s  higher return on equity  reporting losses through other comprehensive income and  higher leverage  should be of concern to an analyst  An analyst should investigate  further rather than reaching a conclusion based on ratios alone  in other words try to  identify the underlying causes of changes or differences in ratios

13,411,Based on the numbers as reported CAT appears to have a lower percentage of assets  tied up in inventory than Volvo  However when CAT s inventory is adjusted to FIFO it  has a higher percentage of its assets tied up in inventory than Volvo 
14,411,The increase in Volvo s inventory as a percentage of total assets is cause for some  concern  Higher inventory typically results in higher maintenance costs  for example  storage and financing costs   In addition Volvo may be building up slow moving or  obsolete inventories that may result in future inventory write downs for       In  Volvo s Note    the breakdown by inventory classification shows a small increase in  the inventory of production materials  It appears that Volvo is planning on reducing  production until it reduces its finished goods inventory  Looking at CAT s Note   all  classifications of inventory seem to be increasing and because these are valued using the  LIFO method there is some cause for concern  The company must be increasing  inventory quantities and adding LIFO layers

6,412,For both companies the growth rates in finished goods inventory exceeds the growth  rate in sales  this could be indicative of accumulating excess inventory  Volvo s growth  rate in finished goods compared to its growth rate in sales is significantly higher but the  lower growth rates in finished goods inventory for CAT is potentially a result of using  the LIFO method versus the FIFO method  It appears Volvo is aware that an issue exists  and is planning on cutting back production given the relatively small increase in  inventories other than finished products  Regardless an analyst should do further  investigation before reaching any conclusion about a company s future prospects for  sales and profit

2,413,From the CEO Comment   In a declining economy it is extremely  important to act quickly to reduce the Group s cost level and ensure we do  not build inventories since large inventories generally lead to pressure on  prices      During the second half of the year we implemented sharp  production cutbacks to lower inventories of new trucks and construction  equipment as part of efforts to maintain our product prices which represent  one of the most important factors in securing favorable profitability in the  future  We have been successful in these efforts  During the fourth quarter  inventories of new trucks declined     and of new construction equipment  by      During the beginning of      we have continued to work  diligently and focused to reduce inventories to the new lower levels of  demand that prevail in most of our markets and for most of our products  
3,413,From the Board of Directors  Report        Inventory reduction  contributed to positive operating cash flow of SEK     billion in Industrial  Operations      The value of inventories increased during      by SEK       billion  Adjusted for currency changes the increase amounted to SEK      billion  The increase is mainly related to the truck operations and to  construction equipment and is an effect of the rapidly weakening demand  during the second half of the year      In order to reduce the capital tied  up in inventory a number of shutdown days in production were carried out  during the end of year  Measures aimed at selling primarily trucks and  construction equipment in inventory were prioritized  These measures have  continued during the beginning of        and  Overcapacity within the  industry can occur if there is a lack of demand potentially leading to  increased price pressure  
4,413,From Business Areas       Ambitions         Execute on cost reduction  and adjust production to ensure inventory levels in line with demand  
5,413,Assume inventory write downs are reported as part of cost of sales  Based on the  excerpts above discuss the anticipated direction of the following for      compared to

12,413,Solution to   
13,413,Inventory carrying amounts are expected to decrease as the company cuts back on  inventory levels and pressures are exerted on costs and prices

5,414,Unit sales and sales revenues are expected to decline due to decrease in demand and  pressure on prices 
6,414,Solution to   
7,414,Gross profit margin is difficult to predict  Sales revenues are expected to decline but  cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenue may decline if cost controls are effective  stay the same if cost controls are offset by increased inventory write downs or increase  if inventory write downs more than offset cost controls  In this case an analyst might  use      s gross profit margin of      percent as a reasonable prediction  It is less than  the      and      gross profit margin of      percent and may already reflect cost  controls price pressures and inventory write downs 
8,414,Solution to   
9,414,Return on assets is expected to decline  The positive effects of cost controls and  reduction in assets is likely to be offset by decreased net income due to the declining  sales revenues 
10,414,Solution to   
11,414,The direction of change in the current ratio is difficult to predict  Current assets are  expected to be reduced but current liabilities are also expected to be reduced as costs are  controlled and purchases are reduced resulting in lower accounts payable

2,420,Solution to   
3,420,From      to      the inventory turnover ratio declined and the number of days of  inventory increased by     days  ALU appears to be managing inventory less efficiently   The gross profit margin improved by     percent from      percent in      to       percent in       The current ratio is relatively unchanged from      to       The debt  to equity ratio has risen significantly in      compared to       Although ALU s total  debt has been relatively stable during this time period the company s equity has been  declining rapidly because of the cumulative effect of its net losses on retained earnings 
4,420,The return on assets is negative and got worse in      compared to       A larger net  loss and lower total assets in      resulted in a higher negative return on assets  The  analyst should investigate the underlying reasons for the sharp decline in ALU s return  on assets  From Exhibit   it is apparent that ALU s gross profit margins were  insufficient to cover the administrative and selling expenses and research and  development costs in      and       Large restructuring costs and asset impairment  losses contributed to the loss from operating activities in both      and      
5,420,Solution to   
6,420,If inventory replacement costs were increasing during           and       and  inventory quantity levels were stable or increasing  ALU s cost of sales would have  been higher and its gross profit margin would have been lower under the weighted  average cost inventory method than what was reported under the FIFO method   assuming no inventory write downs that would otherwise neutralize the differences  between the inventory valuation methods   FIFO allocates the oldest inventory costs to  cost of sales  the reported cost of sales would be lower under FIFO given increasing  inventory costs  Inventory carrying amounts would be higher under the FIFO method  than under the weighted average cost method because the more recently purchased  inventory items would be included in inventory at their higher costs  again assuming no  inventory write downs that would otherwise neutralize the differences between the  inventory valuation methods   Consequently ALU s reported gross profit net income  and retained earnings would also be higher for those years under the FIFO method 
7,420,The effects on ratios are as follows 
8,420,  The inventory turnover ratios would all be higher under the weighted average cost  method because the numerator  cost of sales  would be higher and the  denominator  inventory  would be lower than what was reported by ALU under  the FIFO method 
9,420,  The number of days of inventory would be lower under the weighted average cost  method because the inventory turnover ratios would be higher 
10,420,  The gross profit margin ratios would all be lower under the weighted average cost  method because cost of sales would be higher under the weighted average cost  method than under the FIFO method 
11,420,  The current ratios would all be lower under the weighted average cost method  because inventory carrying values would be lower than under the FIFO method   current liabilities would be the same under both methods

2,421,  The return on assets ratios would all be lower under the weighted average cost  method because the incremental profit added to the numerator  net income  has a  greater impact than the incremental increase to the denominator  total assets   By  way of example assume that a company has    million in net income and       million in total assets using the weighted average cost method  If the company  reports another    million in net income by using FIFO instead of weighted  average cost it would then also report an additional    million in total assets   after tax   Based on this example the return on assets is      percent            under the weighted average cost method and      percent           under the  FIFO method 
3,421,  The debt to equity ratios would all be higher under the weighted average cost  method because retained earnings would be lower than under the FIFO method   again assuming no inventory write downs that would otherwise neutralize the  differences between the inventory valuation methods  
4,421,Conversely if inventory replacement costs were decreasing during           and        and inventory quantity levels were stable or increasing  ALU s cost of sales  would have been lower and its gross profit and inventory would have been higher under  the weighted average cost method than were reported under the FIFO method  assuming  no inventory write downs that would otherwise neutralize the differences between the  inventory valuation methods   As a result the ratio assessment that was performed  above would result in directly opposite conclusions 
5,421,SUMMARY
6,421,The choice of inventory valuation method  cost formula or cost flow assumption  can have a  potentially significant impact on inventory carrying amounts and cost of sales  These in turn  impact other financial statement items such as current assets total assets gross profit and net  income  The financial statements and accompanying notes provide important information about  a company s inventory accounting policies that the analyst needs to correctly assess financial  performance and compare it with that of other companies  Key concepts in this reading are as  follows 
7,421,  Inventories are a major factor in the analysis of merchandising and manufacturing  companies  Such companies generate their sales and profits through inventory  transactions on a regular basis  An important consideration in determining profits for  these companies is measuring the cost of sales when inventories are sold 
8,421,  The total cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase costs of conversion and  other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition   Storage costs of finished inventory and abnormal costs due to waste are typically treated  as expenses in the period in which they occurred

2,422,  The allowable inventory valuation methods implicitly involve different assumptions  about cost flows  The choice of inventory valuation method determines how the cost of  goods available for sale during the period is allocated between inventory and cost of  sales 
3,422,  IFRS allow three inventory valuation methods  cost formulas   first in first out  FIFO    weighted average cost  and specific identification  The specific identification method is  used for inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable and for goods or  services produced and segregated for specific projects  US GAAP allow the three  methods above plus the last in first out  LIFO  method  The LIFO method is widely used  in the United States for both tax and financial reporting purposes because of potential  income tax savings 
4,422,  The choice of inventory method affects the financial statements and any financial ratios  that are based on them  As a consequence the analyst must carefully consider inventory  valuation method differences when evaluating a company s performance over time or in  comparison to industry data or industry competitors 
5,422,  A company must use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and  use to the entity 
6,422,  The inventory accounting system  perpetual or periodic  may result in different values for  cost of sales and ending inventory when the weighted average cost or LIFO inventory  valuation method is used 
7,422,  Under US GAAP companies that use the LIFO method must disclose in their financial  notes the amount of the LIFO reserve or the amount that would have been reported in  inventory if the FIFO method had been used  This information can be used to adjust  reported LIFO inventory and cost of goods sold balances to the FIFO method for  comparison purposes 
8,422,  LIFO liquidation occurs when the number of units in ending inventory declines from the  number of units that were present at the beginning of the year  If inventory unit costs  have generally risen from year to year this will produce an inventory related increase in  gross profits 
9,422,  Consistency of inventory costing is required under both IFRS and US GAAP  If a  company changes an accounting policy the change must be justifiable and applied  retrospectively to the financial statements  An exception to the retrospective restatement  is when a company reporting under US GAAP changes to the LIFO method 
10,422,  Under IFRS inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value  Net  realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the  estimated costs necessary to make the sale  Under US GAAP inventories are measured at  the lower of cost market value or net realisable value depending upon the inventory  method used  Market value is defined as current replacement cost subject to an upper  limit of net realizable value and a lower limit of net realizable value less a normal profit  margin  Reversals of previous write downs are permissible under IFRS but not under US  GAAP 
11,422,  Reversals of inventory write downs may occur under IFRS but are not allowed under US  GAAP

2,423,  Changes in the carrying amounts within inventory classifications  such as raw materials  work in process and finished goods  may provide signals about a company s future sales  and profits  Relevant information with respect to inventory management and future sales  may be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis or similar items within the  annual or quarterly reports industry news and publications and industry economic data 
3,423,  The inventory turnover ratio number of days of inventory ratio and gross profit margin  ratio are useful in evaluating the management of a company s inventory 
4,423,  Inventory management may have a substantial impact on a company s activity  profitability liquidity and solvency ratios  It is critical for the analyst to be aware of  industry trends and management s intentions 
5,423,  Financial statement disclosures provide information regarding the accounting policies  adopted in measuring inventories the principal uncertainties regarding the use of  estimates related to inventories and details of the inventory carrying amounts and costs   This information can greatly assist analysts in their evaluation of a company s inventory  management

12,429,The following information relates to Questions      
13,429,Hans Annan CFA a food and beverage analyst is reviewing Century Chocolate s inventory  policies as part of his evaluation of the company  Century Chocolate based in Switzerland  manufactures chocolate products and purchases and resells other confectionery products to  complement its chocolate line  Annan visited Century Chocolate s manufacturing facility last  year  He learned that cacao beans imported from Brazil represent the most significant raw  material and that the work in progress inventory consists primarily of three items  roasted cacao  beans a thick paste produced from the beans  called chocolate liquor  and a sweetened mixture  that needs to be  conched  to produce chocolate  On the tour Annan learned that the conching  process ranges from a few hours for lower quality products to six days for the highest quality  chocolates  While there Annan saw the facility s climate controlled area where manufactured  finished products  cocoa and chocolate  and purchased finished goods are stored prior to  shipment to customers  After touring the facility Annan had a discussion with Century  Chocolate s CFO regarding the types of costs that were included in each inventory category 
14,429,Annan has asked his assistant Joanna Kern to gather some preliminary information regarding  Century Chocolate s financial statements and inventories  He also asked Kern to calculate the  inventory turnover ratios for Century Chocolate and another chocolate manufacturer for the  most recent five years  Annan does not know Century Chocolate s most direct competitor so he  asks Kern to do some research and select the most appropriate company for the ratio  comparison 
15,429,Kern reports back that Century Chocolate prepares its financial statements in accordance with  IFRS  She tells Annan that the policy footnote states that raw materials and purchased finished  goods are valued at purchase cost whereas work in progress and manufactured finished goods  are valued at production cost  Raw material inventories and purchased finished goods are  accounted for using the FIFO  first in first out  method and the weighted average cost method  is used for other inventories  An allowance is established when the net realisable value of any  inventory item is lower than the value calculated above

2,430,Kern provides Annan with the selected financial statements and inventory data for Century  Chocolate shown in Exhibits   through    The ratio exhibit Kern prepared compares Century  Chocolate s inventory turnover ratios to those of Gordon s Goodies a US based company   Annan returns the exhibit and tells Kern to select a different competitor that reports using IFRS  rather than US GAAP  During this initial review Annan asks Kern why she has not indicated  whether Century Chocolate uses a perpetual or a periodic inventory system  Kern replies that  she learned that Century Chocolate uses a perpetual system but did not include this information  in her report because inventory values would be the same under either a perpetual or periodic  inventory system  Annan tells Kern she is wrong and directs her to research the matter 
3,430,While Kern is revising her analysis Annan reviews the most recent month s Cocoa Market  Review from the International Cocoa Organization  He is drawn to the statement that  the  ICCO daily price averaging prices in both futures markets reached a    year high in US   terms and a    year high in SDRs terms  the SDR unit comprises a basket of major currencies  used in international trade  US  euro pound sterling and yen    Annan makes a note that he  will need to factor the potential continuation of this trend into his analysis

5,432,    The costs least likely to be included by the CFO as inventory are 
6,432,A  storage costs for the chocolate liquor 
7,432,B  excise taxes paid to the government of Brazil for the cacao beans 
8,432,C  storage costs for chocolate and purchased finished goods awaiting shipment to  customers 
9,432,    What is the most likely justification for Century Chocolate s choice of inventory valuation  method for its purchased finished goods 
10,432,A  It is the preferred method under IFRS 
11,432,B  It allocates the same per unit cost to both cost of sales and inventory 
12,432,C  Ending inventory reflects the cost of goods purchased most recently 
13,432,    In Kern s comparative ratio analysis the      inventory turnover ratio for Century  Chocolate is closest to 
14,432,A       
15,432,B       
16,432,C       
17,432,    The most accurate statement regarding Annan s reasoning for requiring Kern to select a  competitor that reports under IFRS for comparative purposes is that under US GAAP 
18,432,A  fair values are used to value inventory 
19,432,B  the LIFO method is permitted to value inventory 
20,432,C  the specific identification method is permitted to value inventory 
21,432,    Annan s statement regarding the perpetual and periodic inventory systems is most  significant when which of the following costing systems is used 
22,432,A  LIFO

2,433,B  FIFO 
3,433,C  Specific identification 
4,433,    Using the inventory record for purchased lemon drops shown in Exhibit   the cost of  sales for      will be closest to 
5,433,A  CHF      
6,433,B  CHF      
7,433,C  CHF      
8,433,    Ignoring any tax effect the      net realisable value reassessment for the black licorice  jelly beans will most likely result in 
9,433,A  an increase in gross profit of CHF      
10,433,B  an increase in gross profit of CHF       
11,433,C  no impact on cost of sales because under IFRS write downs cannot be reversed 
12,433,    If the trend noted in the ICCO report continues and Century Chocolate plans to maintain  constant or increasing inventory quantities the most likely impact on Century Chocolate s  financial statements related to its raw materials inventory will be 
13,433,A  a cost of sales that more closely reflects current replacement values 
14,433,B  a higher allocation of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of sales 
15,433,C  a higher allocation of the total cost of goods available for sale to ending inventory

5,441,    The      inventory value as reported on the      Annual Report if the company had  used the FIFO inventory valuation method instead of the LIFO inventory valuation  method for a portion of its inventory would be closest to

9,441,    What is the least likely reason why ZP may need to change its accounting policies  regarding inventory at some point after      
10,441,A  The US SEC is likely to require companies to use the same inventory valuation  method for all inventories 
11,441,B  The US SEC is likely to prohibit the use of one of the methods ZP currently uses  for inventory valuation 
12,441,C  One of the inventory valuation methods used for US tax purposes may be repealed  as an acceptable method 
13,441,    If ZP had prepared its financial statement in accordance with IFRS the inventory  turnover ratio  using average inventory  for      would be 
14,441,A  lower 
15,441,B  higher

19,441,B  decreased sales volume 
20,441,C  fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates 
21,441,    Which observation is most likely a result of looking only at the information reported in  Note   
22,441,A  Increased competition has led to lower unit sales

2,442,    Note   indicates that  Inventories valued on the LIFO basis totaled        million and         million at December         and      respectively   Based on this the LIFO  reserve should most likely 
3,442,A  increase 
4,442,B  decrease 
5,442,C  remain the same 
6,442,    The Industry and Business Risk excerpt states that  Increased competition may lead to  lower unit sales and excess production capacity and excess inventory  This may result in  a further downward price pressure   The downward price pressure could lead to inventory  that is valued above current market prices or net realisable value  Any write downs of  inventory are least likely to have a significant effect on the inventory valued using

10,442,SOLUTIONS
11,442,   C is correct  Transportation costs incurred to ship inventory to customers are an expense  and may not be capitalized in inventory   Transportation costs incurred to bring inventory  to the business location can be capitalized in inventory   Storage costs required as part of  production as well as costs incurred as a result of normal waste of materials can be  capitalized in inventory   Costs incurred as a result of abnormal waste must be expensed  
12,442,   B is correct  Inventory expense includes costs of purchase costs of conversion and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition  It does  not include storage costs not required as part of production 
13,442,   A is correct  IFRS allow the inventories of producers and dealers of agricultural and  forest products agricultural produce after harvest and minerals and mineral products to  be carried at net realisable value even if above historical cost   US GAAP treatment is  similar  
14,442,   A is correct  A perpetual inventory system updates inventory values and quantities and  cost of goods sold continuously to reflect purchases and sales  The ending inventory of      units consists of     units at     and     units at     
15,442,                                  
16,442,   A is correct  In an environment with falling inventory costs and declining inventory  levels periodic LIFO will result in a higher ending inventory value and lower cost of  goods sold versus perpetual LIFO and perpetual FIFO methods  This results in a lower  inventory turnover ratio which is calculated as follows

2,443,Inventory turnover ratio   Cost of goods sold Ending inventory
3,443,The inventory turnover ratio using periodic LIFO is                      or       times 
4,443,The inventory turnover ratio using perpetual LIFO is      or      times which is  provided in Table                  from previous question  
5,443,The inventory turnover for perpetual FIFO is                      or      times 
6,443,   B is correct  During a period of rising inventory costs a company using the FIFO method  will allocate a lower amount to cost of goods sold and a higher amount to ending  inventory as compared with the LIFO method  The inventory turnover ratio is the ratio of  cost of sales to ending inventory  A company using the FIFO method will produce a  lower inventory turnover ratio as compared with the LIFO method  The current ratio   current assets current liabilities  and the gross profit margin  gross profit sales    sales  less cost of goods sold  sales  will be higher under the FIFO method than under the LIFO  method in periods of rising inventory unit costs 
7,443,   A is correct  LIFO reserve is the FIFO inventory value less the LIFO inventory value  In  periods of rising inventory unit costs the carrying amount of inventory under FIFO will  always exceed the carrying amount of inventory under LIFO  The LIFO reserve may  increase over time as a result of the increasing difference between the older costs used to  value inventory under LIFO and the more recent costs used to value inventory under  FIFO  When inventory unit levels are decreasing the company will experience a LIFO  liquidation reducing the LIFO reserve 
8,443,   A is correct  When the number of units sold exceeds the number of units purchased a  company using LIFO will experience a LIFO liquidation  If inventory unit costs have  been rising from period to period and a LIFO liquidation occurs it will produce an  increase in gross profit as a result of the lower inventory carrying amounts of the  liquidated units  lower cost per unit of the liquidated units  
9,443,   B is correct  The adjusted COGS under the FIFO method is equal to COGS under the  LIFO method less the increase in LIFO reserve 
10,443,COGS  FIFO    COGS  LIFO    Increase in LIFO reserve

13,443,    B is correct  Under IFRS the reversal of write downs is required if net realisable value  increases  The inventory will be reported on the balance sheet at           The  inventory is reported at the lower of cost or net realisable value  Under US GAAP  inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value  After a write down a new cost  basis is determined and additional revisions may only reduce the value further  The  reversal of write downs is not permitted 
14,443,    A is correct  IFRS require the reversal of inventory write downs if net realisable values  increase  US GAAP do not permit the reversal of write downs

2,444,    C is correct  Activity ratios  for example inventory turnover and total asset turnover  will  be positively affected by a write down to net realizable value because the asset base   denominator  is reduced  On the balance sheet the inventory carrying amount is written  down to its net realizable value and the loss in value  expense  is generally reflected on  the income statement in cost of goods sold thus reducing gross profit operating profit  and net income 
3,444,    B is correct  Cinnamon uses the weighted average cost method so in           units of  inventory were      units at     each and       were      purchases at      The  weighted average cost of inventory during      was thus                                                        and the weighted average cost was approximately                          Cost of sales was                which is approximately         
4,444,    C is correct  Zimt uses the FIFO method and thus the first      units sold in       depleted the      inventory  Of the inventory purchased in            units were sold  and       remain valued at     each for a total of         
5,444,    A is correct  Zimt uses the FIFO method so its cost of sales represents units purchased at  a  no longer available  lower price  Nutmeg uses the LIFO method so its cost of sales is  approximately equal to the current replacement cost of inventory 
6,444,    B is correct  Nutmeg uses the LIFO method and thus some of the inventory on the  balance sheet was purchased at a  no longer available  lower price  Zimt uses the FIFO  method so the carrying value on the balance sheet represents the most recently purchased  units and thus approximates the current replacement cost 
7,444,    B is correct  In a declining price environment the newest inventory is the lowest cost  inventory  In such circumstances using the LIFO method  selling the newer cheaper  inventory first  will result in lower cost of sales and higher profit 
8,444,    B is correct  In a rising price environment inventory balances will be higher for the  company using the FIFO method  Accounts payable are based on amounts due to  suppliers not the amounts accrued based on inventory accounting 
9,444,    C is correct  The write down reduced the value of inventory and increased cost of sales in        The higher numerator and lower denominator mean that the inventory turnover  ratio as reported was too high  Gross margin and the current ratio were both too low 
10,444,    A is correct  The reversal of the write down shifted cost of sales from      to       The       cost of sales was higher because of the write down and the      cost of sales was  lower because of the reversal of the write down  As a result the reported      profits  were overstated  Inventory balance in      is the same because the write down and  reversal cancel each other out  Cash flow from operations is not affected by the non cash  write down but the higher profits in      likely resulted in higher taxes and thus lower  cash flow from operations 
11,444,    B is correct  LIFO will result in lower inventory and higher cost of sales  Gross margin  a  profitability ratio  will be lower the current ratio  a liquidity ratio  will be lower and  inventory turnover  an efficiency ratio  will be higher 
12,444,    A is correct  LIFO will result in lower inventory and higher cost of sales in periods of  rising costs compared to FIFO  Consequently LIFO results in a lower gross profit margin  than FIFO

2,445,    B is correct  The LIFO method increases cost of sales thus reducing profits and the taxes  thereon 
3,445,    A is correct  US GAAP do not permit inventory write downs to be reversed 
4,445,    B is correct  Both US GAAP and IFRS require disclosure of the amount of inventories  recognized as an expense during the period  Only US GAAP allows the LIFO method and  requires disclosure of any material amount of income resulting from the liquidation of  LIFO inventory  US GAAP does not permit the reversal of prior year inventory write  downs 
5,445,    B is correct  A significant increase  attributable to increases in unit volume rather than  increases in unit cost  in raw materials and or work in progress inventories may signal  that the company expects an increase in demand for its products  If the growth of finished  goods inventories is greater than the growth of sales it could indicate a decrease in  demand and a decrease in future earnings  A substantial increase in finished goods  inventories while raw materials and work in progress inventories are declining may  signal a decrease in demand for the company s products 
6,445,    B is correct  During a period of rising inventory prices a company using the LIFO  method will have higher cost of cost of goods sold and lower inventory compared with a  company using the FIFO method  The inventory turnover ratio will be higher for the  company using the LIFO method thus making it appear more efficient  Current assets  and gross profit margin will be lower for the company using the LIFO method thus  making it appear less liquid and less profitable 
7,445,    B is correct  In an environment of declining inventory unit costs and constant or  increasing inventory quantities FIFO  in comparison with weighted average cost or  LIFO  will have higher cost of goods sold  and net income  and lower inventory  Because  both inventory and net income are lower total equity is lower resulting in a higher debt  to equity ratio 
8,445,    C is correct  The storage costs for inventory awaiting shipment to customers are not costs  of purchase costs of conversion or other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition and are not included in inventory  The storage costs  for the chocolate liquor occur during the production process and are thus part of the  conversion costs  Excise taxes are part of the purchase cost 
9,445,    C is correct  The carrying amount of inventories under FIFO will more closely reflect  current replacement values because inventories are assumed to consist of the most  recently purchased items  FIFO is an acceptable but not preferred method under IFRS   Weighted average cost not FIFO is the cost formula that allocates the same per unit cost  to both cost of sales and inventory 
10,445,    B is correct  Inventory turnover   Cost of sales Average inventory                         Average inventory is                          
11,445,    B is correct  For comparative purposes the choice of a competitor that reports under  IFRS is requested because LIFO is permitted under US GAAP

2,446,    A is correct  The carrying amount of the ending inventory may differ because the  perpetual system will apply LIFO continuously throughout the year liquidating layers as  sales are made  Under the periodic system the sales will start from the last layer in the  year  Under FIFO the sales will occur from the same layers regardless of whether a  perpetual or periodic system is used  Specific identification identifies the actual products  sold and remaining in inventory and there will be no difference under a perpetual or  periodic system 
3,446,    B is correct  The cost of sales is closest to CHF       Under FIFO the inventory  acquired first is sold first  Using Exhibit   a total of     cartons were available for sale                        and     cartons were sold                 leaving     in ending  inventory  The FIFO cost would be as follows 
4,446,     beginning inventory             
5,446,      February                  
6,446,       July                  
7,446,Cost of sales                        CHF     
8,446,    A is correct  Gross profit will most likely increase by CHF       The net realisable value  has increased and now exceeds the cost  The write down from      can be reversed  The  write down in      was                               IFRS require the reversal of any  write downs for a subsequent increase in value of inventory previously written down  The  reversal is limited to the lower of the subsequent increase or the original write down   Only       kilograms remain in inventory  the reversal is                                The amount of any reversal of a write down is recognised as a reduction in cost of  sales  This reduction results in an increase in gross profit 
9,446,    C is correct  Using the FIFO method to value inventories when prices are rising will  allocate more of the cost of goods available for sale to ending inventories  the most recent  purchases which are at higher costs are assumed to remain in inventory  and less to cost  of sales  the oldest purchases which are at lower costs are assumed to be sold first  
10,446,    C is correct  Karp s inventory under FIFO equals Karp s inventory under LIFO plus the  LIFO reserve  Therefore as of    December      Karp s inventory under FIFO equals

14,446,    B is correct  Karp s cost of goods sold  COGS  under FIFO equals Karp s cost of goods  sold under LIFO minus the increase in the LIFO reserve  Therefore for the year ended     December      Karp s cost of goods sold under FIFO equals

2,447,    A is correct  Karp s net income  NI  under FIFO equals Karp s net income under LIFO  plus the after tax increase in the LIFO reserve  For the year ended    December       Karp s net income under FIFO equals

17,447,       million
18,447,    A is correct  The cash ratio  cash and cash equivalents   current liabilities  would be  lower because cash would have been less under FIFO  Karp s income before taxes would  have been higher under FIFO and consequently taxes paid by Karp would have also been  higher and cash would have been lower  There is no impact on current liabilities  Both  Karp s current ratio and gross profit margin would have been higher if FIFO had been  used  The current ratio would have been higher because inventory under FIFO increases  by a larger amount than the cash decreases for taxes paid  Because the cost of goods sold  under FIFO is lower than under LIFO the gross profit margin would have been higher 
19,447,    B is correct  If Karp had used FIFO instead of LIFO the debt to equity ratio would have  decreased  No change in debt would have occurred but shareholders  equity would have  increased as a result of higher retained earnings

11,448,    B is correct  Rolby s adjusted net profit margin must be computed using net income  NI   under FIFO and excluding charges for increases in valuation allowances 
12,448,NI  adjusted    NI  FIFO method    Charges included in cost of goods sold for  inventory write downs after tax

17,448,    A is correct  Mikko s adjusted debt to equity ratio is lower because the debt  numerator   is unchanged and the adjusted shareholders  equity  denominator  is higher  The adjusted  shareholders  equity corresponds to shareholders  equity under FIFO excluding charges  for increases in valuation allowances  Therefore adjusted shareholders  equity is higher  than reported  unadjusted  shareholders  equity 
18,448,    C is correct  Mikko s and Crux s gross margin ratios would better reflect the current  gross margin of the industry than Rolby because both use LIFO  LIFO recognizes as cost  of goods sold the cost of the most recently purchased units therefore it better reflects  replacement cost  However Mikko s gross margin ratio best reflects the current gross  margin of the industry because Crux s LIFO reserve is decreasing  This could reflect a  LIFO liquidation by Crux which would distort gross profit margin 
19,448,    B is correct  The FIFO method shows a higher gross profit margin than the LIFO method  in an inflationary scenario because FIFO allocates to cost of goods sold the cost of the  oldest units available for sale  In an inflationary environment these units are the ones  with the lowest cost

2,449,    A is correct  An inventory write down increases cost of sales and reduces profit and  reduces the carrying value of inventory and assets  This has a negative effect on  profitability and solvency ratios  However activity ratios appear positively affected by a  write down because the asset base whether total assets or inventory  denominator  is  reduced  The numerator sales in total asset turnover is unchanged and the numerator  cost of sales in inventory turnover is increased  Thus turnover ratios are higher and  appear more favorable as the result of the write down 
3,449,    B is correct  Finished goods least accurately reflect current prices because some of the  finished goods are valued under the  last in first out    LIFO   basis  The costs of the  newest units available for sale are allocated to cost of goods sold leaving the oldest units   at lower costs  in inventory  ZP values raw materials and work in process using the  weighted average cost method  While not fully reflecting current prices some  inflationary effect will be included in the inventory values 
4,449,    C is correct  FIFO inventory   Reported inventory   LIFO reserve                               The LIFO reserve is disclosed in Note   of the notes to consolidated financial  statements 
5,449,    A is correct  The SEC does not require companies to use the same inventory valuation  method for all inventories so this is the least likely reason to change accounting policies  regarding inventory  The SEC is currently evaluating whether all US companies should  be required to adopt IFRS  If the SEC requires companies to adopt IFRS the LIFO  method of inventory valuation would no longer be allowed 
6,449,    A is correct  The inventory turnover ratio would be lower  The average inventory would  be higher under FIFO and cost of products sold would be lower by the increase in LIFO  reserve  LIFO is not permitted under IFRS 
7,449,Inventory turnover ratio   Cost of products sold   Average inventory

10,449,    A is correct  No LIFO liquidation occurred during       the LIFO reserve increased from         million in      to        million in       Management stated in the MD A  that the decrease in inventories reflected the impacts of decreased sales volumes and  fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates 
11,449,    C is correct  Finished goods and raw materials inventories are lower in      when  compared to       Reduced levels of inventory typically indicate an anticipated business  contraction 
12,449,    B is correct  The decrease in LIFO inventory in      would typically indicate that more  inventory units were sold than produced or purchased  Accordingly one would expect a  liquidation of some of the older LIFO layers and the LIFO reserve to decrease  In  actuality the LIFO reserve increased from        million in      to        million in        This is not to be expected and is likely caused by the increase in prices of raw  materials other production materials and parts of foreign currencies as noted in the  MD A  An analyst should seek to confirm this explanation

2,450,    B is correct  If prices have been decreasing write downs under FIFO are least likely to  have a significant effect because the inventory is valued at closer to the new lower  prices  Typically inventories valued using LIFO are less likely to incur inventory write  downs than inventories valued using weighted average cost or FIFO  Under LIFO the  oldest costs are reflected in the inventory carrying value on the balance sheet  Given  increasing inventory costs the inventory carrying values under the LIFO method are  already conservatively presented at the oldest and lowest costs  Thus it is far less likely  that inventory write downs will occur under LIFO  and if a write down does occur it is  likely to be of a lesser magnitude

27,452,   INTRODUCTION
28,452,Long lived assets also referred to as non current assets or long term assets are assets that are expected to provide economic benefits over a future  period of time typically greater than one year   Long lived assets may be tangible intangible or financial assets  Examples of long lived tangible  assets typically referred to as property plant and equipment and sometimes as fixed assets include land buildings furniture and fixtures  machinery and equipment and vehicles  examples of long lived intangible assets  assets lacking physical substance  include patents and  trademarks  and examples of long lived financial assets include investments in equity or debt securities issued by other companies  The scope of this  reading is limited to long lived tangible and intangible assets  hereafter referred to for simplicity as long lived assets

2,453,The first issue in accounting for a long lived asset is determining its cost at acquisition  The second issue is how to allocate the cost to expense over  time  The costs of most long lived assets are capitalised and then allocated as expenses in the profit or loss  income  statement over the period of time  during which they are expected to provide economic benefits  The two main types of long lived assets with costs that are typically not allocated over  time are land which is not depreciated and those intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  Additional issues that arise are the treatment of  subsequent costs incurred related to the asset the use of the cost model versus the revaluation model unexpected declines in the value of the asset  classification of the asset with respect to intent  for example held for use or held for sale  and the derecognition of the asset 
3,453,This reading is organised as follows  Section   describes and illustrates accounting for the acquisition of long lived assets with particular attention to  the impact of capitalizing versus expensing expenditures  Section   describes the allocation of the costs of long lived assets over their useful lives   Section   discusses the revaluation model that is based on changes in the fair value of an asset  Section   covers the concepts of impairment   unexpected decline in the value of an asset   Section   describes accounting for the derecognition of long lived assets  Section   describes financial  statement presentation disclosures and analysis of long lived assets  Section   discusses differences in financial reporting of investment property  compared with property plant and equipment  Section   describes accounting for leases  A summary is followed by practice problems 
4,453,   ACQUISITION OF LONG LIVED ASSETS
5,453,Upon acquisition property plant and equipment  tangible assets with an economic life of longer than one year and intended to be held for the  company s own use  are recorded on the balance sheet at cost which is typically the same as their fair value   Accounting for an intangible asset  depends on how the asset is acquired  If several assets are acquired as part of a group the purchase price is allocated to each asset on the basis of its  fair value  An asset s cost potentially includes expenditures additional to the purchase price 
6,453,A key concept in accounting for expenditures related to long lived assets is whether and when such expenditures are capitalised  i e  included in the  asset shown on the balance sheet  versus expensed  i e  treated as an expense of the period on the income statement   After examining the specific  treatment of certain expenditures we will consider the general financial statement impact of capitalising versus expensing and two analytical issues  related to the decision namely the effects on an individual company s trend analysis and on comparability across companies 
7,453,     Property Plant and Equipment
8,453,This section primarily discusses the accounting treatment for the acquisition of long lived tangible assets  property plant and equipment  through  purchase  Assets can be acquired by methods other than purchase   When an asset is exchanged for another asset the asset acquired is recorded at fair  value if reliable measures of fair value exist  Fair value is the fair value of the asset given up unless the fair value of the asset acquired is more clearly  evident  If there is no reliable measure of fair value the acquired asset is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up  In this case the  carrying amount of the assets is unchanged and no gain or loss is reported 
9,453,Typically accounting for the exchange involves removing the carrying amount of the asset given up adding a fair value for the asset acquired and  reporting any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value as a gain or loss  A gain would be reported when the fair value used for the  newly acquired asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset given up  A loss would be reported when the fair value used for the newly acquired  asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset given up 
10,453,When property plant or equipment is purchased the buyer records the asset at cost  In addition to the purchase price the buyer also includes as part  of the cost of an asset all the expenditures necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use  For example freight costs borne by the purchaser to  get the asset to the purchaser s place of business and special installation and testing costs required to make the asset usable are included in the total  cost of the asset 
11,453,Subsequent expenditures related to long lived assets are included as part of the recorded value of the assets on the balance sheet  i e  capitalised  if  they are expected to provide benefits beyond one year in the future and are expensed if they are not expected to provide benefits in future periods   Expenditures that extend the original life of the asset are typically capitalised  Example   illustrates the difference between costs that are capitalised  and costs that are expensed in a period 
12,453,EXAMPLE  
13,453,Acquisition of PPE
14,453,Assume a  hypothetical  company Trofferini S A  incurred the following expenditures to purchase a towel and tissue roll machine          purchase price including taxes      for delivery of the machine      for installation and testing of the machine and      to train staff on  maintaining the machine  In addition the company paid a construction team      to reinforce the factory floor and ceiling joists to  accommodate the machine s weight  The company also paid       to repair the factory roof  a repair expected to extend the useful life of the  factory by five years  and       to have the exterior of the factory and adjoining offices repainted for maintenance reasons  The repainting  neither extends the life of factory and offices nor improves their usability 
15,453,   Which of these expenditures will be capitalised and which will be expensed 
16,453,   How will the treatment of these expenditures affect the company s financial statements 
17,453,Solution to   
18,453,The company will capitalise as part of the cost of the machine all costs that are necessary to get the new machine ready for its intended use          purchase price      for delivery      for installation and testing and      to reinforce the factory floor and ceiling joists to  accommodate the machine s weight  which was necessary to use the machine and does not increase the value of the factory   The      to train  staff is not necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use and will be expensed 
19,453,The company will capitalise the expenditure of       to repair the factory roof because the repair is expected to extend the useful life of the  factory  The company will expense the       to have the exterior of the factory and adjoining offices repainted because the painting does not  extend the life or alter the productive capacity of the buildings

2,454,Solution to   
3,454,The costs related to the machine that are capitalised        purchase price      for delivery      for installation and testing and      to  prepare the factory will increase the carrying amount of the machine asset as shown on the balance sheet and will be included as investing  cash outflows  The item related to the factory that is capitalised the       roof repair will increase the carrying amount of the factory asset  as shown on the balance sheet and is an investing cash outflow  The expenditures of      to train staff and       to paint are expensed in the  period and will reduce the amount of income reported on the company s income statement  and thus reduce retained earnings on the balance  sheet  and the operating cash flow 
4,454,Example   describes capitalising versus expensing in the context of purchasing property plant and equipment  When a company constructs an asset   or acquires an asset that requires a long period of time to get ready for its intended use  borrowing costs incurred directly related to the construction  are generally capitalised  Constructing a building whether for sale  in which case the building is classified as inventory  or for the company s own  use  in which case the building is classified as a long lived asset  typically requires a substantial amount of time  To finance construction any  borrowing costs incurred prior to the asset being ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset  The company determines the  interest rate to use on the basis of its existing borrowings or if applicable on a borrowing specifically incurred for constructing the asset  If a  company takes out a loan specifically to construct a building the interest cost on that loan during the time of construction would be capitalised as part  of the building s cost  Under IFRS but not under US GAAP income earned on temporarily investing the borrowed monies decreases the amount of  borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation 
5,454,Thus a company s interest costs for a period are included either on the balance sheet  to the extent they are capitalised as part of an asset  or on the  income statement  to the extent they are expensed   If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing an asset for the company s  own use the capitalised interest appears on the balance sheet as a part of the relevant long lived asset  i e  property plant and equipment   The  capitalised interest is expensed over time as the property is depreciated and is thus part of subsequent years  depreciation expense rather than interest  expense of the current period  If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing an asset to sell  for example by a home builder   the capitalised interest appears on the company s balance sheet as part of inventory  The capitalised interest is expensed as part of the cost of goods  sold when the asset is sold  Interest payments made prior to completion of construction that are capitalised are classified as an investing cash outflow   Expensed interest may be classified as an operating or financing cash outflow under IFRS and is classified as an operating cash outflow under US  GAAP 
6,454,EXAMPLE  
7,454,Capitalised Borrowing Costs
8,454,BILDA S A  a hypothetical company borrows          at an interest rate of    percent per year on   January      to finance the  construction of a factory that will have a useful life of    years  Construction is completed after two years during which time the company  earns        by temporarily investing the loan proceeds 
9,454,   What is the amount of interest that will be capitalised under IFRS and how would that amount differ from the amount that would be  capitalised under US GAAP 
10,454,   Where will the capitalised borrowing cost appear on the company s financial statements 
11,454,Solution to   
12,454,The total amount of interest paid on the loan during construction is                               years   Under IFRS the amount of  borrowing cost eligible for capitalisation is reduced by the        interest income from temporarily investing the loan proceeds so the  amount to be capitalised is          Under US GAAP the amount to be capitalised is         
13,454,Solution to   
14,454,The capitalised borrowing costs will appear on the company s balance sheet as a component of property plant and equipment  In the years  prior to completion of construction the interest paid will appear on the statement of cash flows as an investment activity  Over time as the  property is depreciated the capitalised interest component is part of subsequent years  depreciation expense on the company s income  statement 
15,454,     Intangible Assets
16,454,Intangible assets are assets lacking physical substance  Intangible assets include items that involve exclusive rights such as patents copyrights  trademarks and franchises  Under IFRS identifiable intangible assets must meet three definitional criteria  They must be     identifiable  either  capable of being separated from the entity or arising from contractual or legal rights      under the control of the company and     expected to  generate future economic benefits  In addition two recognition criteria must be met      It is probable that the expected future economic benefits of  the asset will flow to the company and     the cost of the asset can be reliably measured  Goodwill which is not considered an identifiable intangible  asset  arises when one company purchases another and the acquisition price exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets  both the tangible assets  and the identifiable intangible assets  acquired 
17,454,Accounting for an intangible asset depends on how it is acquired  The following sections describe accounting for intangible assets obtained in three  ways  purchased in situations other than business combinations developed internally and acquired in business combinations 
18,454,       Intangible Assets Purchased in Situations Other Than Business Combinations
19,454,Intangible assets purchased in situations other than business combinations such as buying a patent are treated at acquisition the same as long lived  tangible assets  they are recorded at their fair value when acquired which is assumed to be equivalent to the purchase price  If several intangible assets  are acquired as part of a group the purchase price is allocated to each asset on the basis of its fair value

2,455,In deciding how to treat individual intangible assets for analytical purposes analysts are particularly aware that companies must use a substantial  amount of judgment and numerous assumptions to determine the fair value of individual intangible assets  For analysis therefore understanding the  types of intangible assets acquired can often be more useful than focusing on the values assigned to the individual assets  In other words an analyst  would typically be more interested in understanding what assets a company acquired  for example franchise rights and a mailing list  than in the  precise portion of the purchase price a company allocated to each asset  Understanding the types of assets a company acquires can offer insights into  the company s strategic direction and future operating potential 
3,455,       Intangible Assets Developed Internally
4,455,In contrast with the treatment of construction costs of tangible assets the costs to internally develop intangible assets are generally expensed when  incurred  There are some situations however in which the costs incurred to internally develop an intangible asset are capitalised  The general  analytical issues related to the capitalising versus expensing decision apply here namely comparability across companies and the effect on an  individual company s trend analysis 
5,455,The general requirement that costs to internally develop intangible assets be expensed should be compared with capitalising the cost of acquiring  intangible assets in situations other than business combinations  Because costs associated with internally developing intangible assets are usually  expensed a company that has internally developed such intangible assets as patents copyrights or brands through expenditures on R D or  advertising will recognise a lower amount of assets than a company that has obtained intangible assets through external purchase  In addition on the  statement of cash flows costs of internally developing intangible assets are classified as operating cash outflows whereas costs of acquiring intangible  assets are classified as investing cash outflows  Differences in strategy  developing versus acquiring intangible assets  can thus impact financial ratios 
6,455,IFRS require that expenditures on research  or during the research phase of an internal project  be expensed rather than capitalised as an intangible  asset   Research is defined as  original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and  understanding    The  research phase of an internal project  refers to the period during which a company cannot demonstrate that an intangible asset  is being created for example the search for alternative materials or systems to use in a production process  IFRS allow companies to recognise an  intangible asset arising from development  or the development phase of an internal project  if certain criteria are met including a demonstration of the  technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset and the intent to use or sell the asset  Development is defined as  the application of research  findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials devices products processes systems or  services before the start of commercial production or use   
7,455,Generally US GAAP require that both research and development costs be expensed as incurred but require capitalisation of certain costs related to  software development   Costs incurred to develop a software product for sale are expensed until the product s technological feasibility is established  and are capitalised thereafter  Similarly companies expense costs related to the development of software for internal use until it is probable that the  project will be completed and that the software will be used as intended  Thereafter development costs are capitalised  The probability that the project  will be completed is easier to demonstrate than is technological feasibility  The capitalised costs related directly to developing software for sale or  internal use include the costs of employees who help build and test the software  The treatment of software development costs under US GAAP is  similar to the treatment of all costs of internally developed intangible assets under IFRS 
8,455,EXAMPLE  
9,455,Software Development Costs
10,455,Assume REH AG a hypothetical company incurs expenditures of       per month during the fiscal year ended    December      to  develop software for internal use  Under IFRS the company must treat the expenditures as an expense until the software meets the criteria for  recognition as an intangible asset after which time the expenditures can be capitalised as an intangible asset 
11,455,   What is the accounting impact of the company being able to demonstrate that the software met the criteria for recognition as an  intangible asset on   February versus   December 
12,455,   How would the treatment of expenditures differ if the company reported under US GAAP and it had established in      that the project  was likely to be completed 
13,455,Solution to   
14,455,If the company is able to demonstrate that the software met the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset on   February the company  would recognise       of expense  on the income statement  during the fiscal year ended    December       The other        of  expenditures would be recognised as an intangible asset  on the balance sheet   Alternatively if the company is not able to demonstrate that the  software met the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset until   December the company would recognise        of expense during the  fiscal year ended    December      with the other       of expenditures recognised as an intangible asset 
15,455,Solution to   
16,455,Under US GAAP the company would capitalise the entire        spent to develop software for internal use 
17,455,       Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination
18,455,When one company acquires another company the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting   Under the acquisition  method the company identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired  and each liability assumed  on the basis of its fair  value  If the purchase price exceeds the sum of the amounts that can be allocated to individual identifiable assets and liabilities the excess is recorded  as goodwill  Goodwill cannot be identified separately from the business as a whole

2,456,Under IFRS the acquired individual assets include identifiable intangible assets that meet the definitional and recognition criteria    Otherwise if the  item is acquired in a business combination and cannot be recognised as a tangible or identifiable intangible asset it is recognised as goodwill  Under  US GAAP there are two criteria to judge whether an intangible asset acquired in a business combination should be recognised separately from  goodwill  The asset must be either an item arising from contractual or legal rights or an item that can be separated from the acquired company   Examples of intangible assets treated separately from goodwill include the intangible assets previously mentioned that involve exclusive rights   patents copyrights franchises licenses  as well as such items as internet domain names and video and audiovisual materials

10,456,     Capitalising versus Expensing  Impact on Financial Statements and Ratios
11,456,This section discusses the implications for financial statements and ratios of capitalising versus expensing costs in the period in which they are  incurred  We first summarize the general financial statement impact of capitalising versus expensing and two analytical issues related to the  decision namely the effect on an individual company s trend analysis and on comparability across companies 
12,456,In the period of the expenditure an expenditure that is capitalised increases the amount of assets on the balance sheet and appears as an investing cash  outflow on the statement of cash flows  After initial recognition a company allocates the capitalised amount over the asset s useful life as depreciation  or amortisation expense  except assets that are not depreciated i e  land or amortised e g  intangible assets with indefinite lives   This expense  reduces net income on the income statement and reduces the value of the asset on the balance sheet  Depreciation and amortisation are non cash  expenses and therefore apart from their effect on taxable income and taxes payable have no impact on the cash flow statement  In the section of the  statement of cash flows that reconciles net income to operating cash flow depreciation and amortisation expenses are added back to net income 
13,456,Alternatively an expenditure that is expensed reduces net income by the after tax amount of the expenditure in the period it is made  No asset is  recorded on the balance sheet and thus no depreciation or amortisation occurs in subsequent periods  The lower amount of net income is reflected in  lower retained earnings on the balance sheet  An expenditure that is expensed appears as an operating cash outflow in the period it is made  There is  no effect on the financial statements of subsequent periods 
14,456,Example   illustrates the impact on the financial statements of capitalising versus expensing an expenditure 
15,456,EXAMPLE  
16,456,General Financial Statement Impact of Capitalising Versus Expensing
17,456,Assume two identical  hypothetical  companies CAP Inc   CAP  and NOW Inc   NOW  start with       cash and       common stock   Each year the companies recognise total revenues of       cash and make cash expenditures excluding an equipment purchase of       At  the beginning of operations each company pays      to purchase equipment  CAP estimates the equipment will have a useful life of three  years and an estimated salvage value of    at the end of the three years  NOW estimates a much shorter useful life and expenses the equipment  immediately  The companies have no other assets and make no other asset purchases during the three year period  Assume the companies pay  no dividends earn zero interest on cash balances have a tax rate of    percent and use the same accounting method for financial and tax  purposes 
18,456,The left side of Exhibit   shows CAP s financial statements  i e  with the expenditure capitalised and depreciated at      per year based on the  straight line method of depreciation       cost minus    salvage value equals      divided by a three year life equals      per year   The  right side of the exhibit shows NOW s financial statements with the entire      expenditure treated as an expense in the first year  All  amounts are in euro

45,457,   Which company reports higher net income over the three years  Total cash flow  Cash from operations 
46,457,   Based on ROE and net profit margin how does the profitability of the two companies compare 
47,457,   Why does NOW report change in cash of     in Year   while CAP reports total change in cash of        
48,457,Solution to   
49,457,Neither company reports higher total net income or cash flow over the three years  The sum of net income over the three years is identical         total  whether the      is capitalised or expensed  Also the sum of the change in cash        total  is identical under either scenario   CAP reports higher cash from operations by an amount of      because under the capitalisation scenario the      purchase is treated as an  investing cash flow 
50,457,Note  Because the companies use the same accounting method for both financial and taxable income absent the assumption of zero interest on  cash balances expensing the      would have resulted in higher income and cash flow for NOW because the lower taxes paid in the first year       versus       would have allowed NOW to earn interest income on the tax savings 
51,457,Solution to   
52,457,In general Ending shareholders  equity   Beginning shareholders  equity   Net income   Other comprehensive income   Dividends   Net  capital contributions from shareholders  Because the companies in this example do not have other comprehensive income did not pay  dividends and reported no capital contributions from shareholders Ending retained earnings   Beginning retained earnings   Net income and  Ending shareholders  equity   Beginning shareholders  equity   Net income 
53,457,ROE is calculated as Net income divided by Average shareholders  equity and Net profit margin is calculated as Net income divided by Total  revenue  For example CAP had Year   ROE of    percent                            and Year   net profit margin of    percent               
54,457,CAP Inc  Capitalise      as asset and depreciate For year       ROE             Net profit margin            
55,457,NOW Inc  Expense      immediately For year       ROE            Net profit margin           
56,457,As shown capitalising results in higher profitability ratios  ROE and net profit margin  in the first year and lower profitability ratios in  subsequent years  For example CAP s Year   ROE of    percent was higher than NOW s Year   ROE of   percent but in Years   and    NOW reports superior profitability 
57,457,Note also that NOW s superior growth in net income between Year   and Year   is not attributable to superior performance compared to CAP  but rather to the accounting decision to recognise the expense sooner than CAP  In general all else equal accounting decisions that result in  recognising expenses sooner will give the appearance of greater subsequent growth  Comparison of the growth of the two companies  net  incomes without an awareness of the difference in accounting methods would be misleading  As a corollary NOW s income and profitability  exhibit greater volatility across the three years not because of more volatile performance but rather because of the different accounting  decision

2,458,Solution to   
3,458,NOW reports an increase in cash of     in Year   while CAP reports a decrease in cash of      because NOW s taxes were      lower than  CAP s taxes      versus       
4,458,Note that this problem assumes the accounting method used by each company for its tax purposes is identical to the accounting method used  by the company for its financial reporting  In many countries companies are allowed to use different depreciation methods for financial  reporting and taxes which may give rise to deferred taxes 
5,458,As shown discretion regarding whether to expense or capitalise expenditures can impede comparability across companies  Example   assumes the  companies purchase a single asset in one year  Because the sum of net income over the three year period is identical whether the asset is capitalised or  expensed it illustrates that although capitalising results in higher profitability compared to expensing in the first year it results in lower profitability  ratios in the subsequent years  Conversely expensing results in lower profitability in the first year but higher profitability in later years indicating a  favorable trend 
6,458,Similarly shareholders  equity for a company that capitalises the expenditure will be higher in the early years because the initially higher profits result  in initially higher retained earnings  Example   assumes the companies purchase a single asset in one year and report identical amounts of total net  income over the three year period so shareholders  equity  and retained earnings  for the firm that expenses will be identical to shareholders  equity   and retained earnings  for the capitalising firm at the end of the three year period 
7,458,Although Example   shows companies purchasing an asset only in the first year if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of  assets each year the profitability enhancing effect of capitalising continues if the amount of the expenditures in a period continues to be more than the  depreciation expense  Example   illustrates this point 
8,458,EXAMPLE  
9,458,Impact of Capitalising Versus Expensing for Ongoing Purchases
10,458,A company buys a      computer in Year   and capitalises the expenditure  The computer has a useful life of three years and an expected  salvage value of    so the annual depreciation expense using the straight line method is      per year  Compared to expensing the entire       immediately the company s pre tax profit in Year   is      greater 
11,458,   Assume that the company continues to buy an identical computer each year at the same price  If the company uses the same accounting  treatment for each of the computers when does the profit enhancing effect of capitalising versus expensing end 
12,458,   If the company buys another identical computer in Year   using the same accounting treatment as the prior years what is the effect on  Year   profits of capitalising versus expensing these expenditures 
13,458,Solution to   
14,458,The profit enhancing effect of capitalising versus expensing would end in Year    In Year   the depreciation expense on each of the three  computers bought in Years     and   would total                            Therefore the total depreciation expense for Year   will be  exactly equal to the capital expenditure in Year    The expense in Year   would be      regardless of whether the company capitalised or  expensed the annual computer purchases 
15,458,Solution to   
16,458,There is no impact on Year   profits  As in the previous year the depreciation expense on each of the three computers bought in Years      and   would total                            Therefore the total depreciation expense for Year   will be exactly equal to the capital  expenditure in Year    Pre tax profits would be reduced by      regardless of whether the company capitalised or expensed the annual  computer purchases 
17,458,Compared to expensing an expenditure capitalising the expenditure typically results in greater amounts reported as cash from operations  Capitalised  expenditures are typically treated as an investment cash outflow whereas expenses reduce operating cash flows  Because cash flow from operating  activities is an important consideration in some valuation models companies may try to maximise reported cash flow from operations by capitalising  expenditures that should be expensed  Valuation models that use free cash flow will consider not only operating cash flows but also investing cash  flows  Analysts should be alert to evidence of companies manipulating reported cash flow from operations by capitalising expenditures that should be  expensed 
18,458,In summary holding all else constant capitalising an expenditure enhances current profitability and increases reported cash flow from operations  The  profitability enhancing effect of capitalising continues so long as capital expenditures exceed the depreciation expense  Profitability enhancing  motivations for decisions to capitalise should be considered when analyzing performance  For example a company may choose to capitalise more  expenditures  within the allowable bounds of accounting standards  to achieve earnings targets for a given period  Expensing a cost in the period  reduces current period profits but enhances future profitability and thus enhances the profit trend  Profit trend enhancing motivations should also be  considered when analyzing performance  If the company is in a reporting environment which requires identical accounting methods for financial  reporting and taxes  unlike the United States which permits companies to use depreciation methods for reporting purposes that differ from the  depreciation method required by tax purposes  then expensing will have a more favorable cash flow impact because paying lower taxes in an earlier  period creates an opportunity to earn interest income on the cash saved 
19,458,In contrast with the relatively simple examples above it is generally neither possible nor desirable to identify individual instances involving discretion  about whether to capitalise or expense expenditures  An analyst can however typically identify significant items of expenditure treated differently  across companies  The items of expenditure giving rise to the most relevant differences across companies will vary by industry  This cross industry  variation is apparent in the following discussion of the capitalisation of expenditures

2,459,     Capitalisation of Interest Costs
3,459,As noted above companies generally must capitalise interest costs associated with acquiring or constructing an asset that requires a long period of  time to get ready for its intended use   
4,459,As a consequence of this accounting treatment a company s interest costs for a period can appear either on the balance sheet  to the extent they are  capitalised  or on the income statement  to the extent they are expensed  
5,459,If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing an asset for the company s own use the capitalised interest appears on the  balance sheet as a part of the relevant long lived asset  The capitalised interest is expensed over time as the property is depreciated and is thus part of  depreciation expense rather than interest expense  If the interest expenditure is incurred in connection with constructing an asset to sell for example  by a real estate construction company the capitalised interest appears on the company s balance sheet as part of inventory  The capitalised interest is  then expensed as part of the cost of sales when the asset is sold 
6,459,The treatment of capitalised interest poses certain issues that analysts should consider  First capitalised interest appears as part of investing cash  outflows whereas expensed interest reduces operating cash flow  Although the treatment is consistent with accounting standards an analyst may want  to examine the impact on reported cash flows  Second interest coverage ratios are solvency indicators measuring the extent to which a company s  earnings  or cash flow  in a period covered its interest costs  To provide a true picture of a company s interest coverage the entire amount of interest  expenditure both the capitalised portion and the expensed portion should be used in calculating interest coverage ratios  Additionally if a company is  depreciating interest that it capitalised in a previous period income should be adjusted to eliminate the effect of that depreciation  Example   illustrates the calculation

21,459,Solution to   
22,459,MTR did not capitalise any interest during      so the interest coverage ratio for this year is affected only by depreciation expense related to  previously capitalised interest  The interest coverage ratio measured as earnings before interest and taxes  EBIT  divided by interest expense  was as follows for

2,460,The above calculations indicate that MTR s interest coverage deteriorated over the three year period from      to      even with no  adjustments for capitalised interest  In both      and      the coverage ratio is lower when adjusted for capitalised interest  For      the  interest coverage ratio of       that includes capitalised interest is substantially lower than the ratio without capitalised interest 
3,460,Solution to   
4,460,If the interest had been expensed rather than capitalised operating cash flows would have been substantially lower in      slightly lower in       but unchanged in       If the interest had been expensed rather than capitalised the trend at least in the last two years would have  been more favorable  operating cash flows would have increased rather than decreased over the      to      period  On an unadjusted basis  for      compared with      MTR s operating cash flow declined by     percent                          If the       of interest had been  expensed rather than capitalised in      the change in operating cash flow would have been positive      percent                                    
5,460,If interest had been expensed rather than capitalised the amount of cash outflow for investing activities would have been lower in      and       but unaffected in       The percentage decline in cash outflows for investing activities from      to      would have been slightly  smaller excluding capitalised interest from investing activities     percent                                               
6,460,The treatment of capitalised interest raises issues for consideration by an analyst  First capitalised interest appears as part of investing cash outflows  whereas expensed interest reduces operating or financing cash flow under IFRS and operating cash flow under US GAAP  An analyst may want to  examine the impact on reported cash flows of interest expenditures when comparing companies  Second interest coverage ratios are solvency  indicators measuring the extent to which a company s earnings  or cash flow  in a period covered its interest costs  To provide a true picture of a  company s interest coverage the entire amount of interest both the capitalised portion and the expensed portion should be used in calculating interest  coverage ratios 
7,460,Generally including capitalised interest in the calculation of interest coverage ratios provides a better assessment of a company s solvency  In  assigning credit ratings rating agencies include capitalised interest in coverage ratios  For example Standard   Poor s calculates the EBIT interest  coverage ratio as EBIT divided by gross interest  defined as interest prior to deductions for capitalised interest or interest income  
8,460,Maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio is a financial covenant often included in lending agreements e g  bank loans and bond indentures  The  definition of the coverage ratio can be found in the company s credit agreement  The definition is relevant because treatment of capitalised interest in  calculating coverage ratios would affect an assessment of how close a company s actual ratios are to the levels specified by its financial covenants and  thus the probability of breaching those covenants 
9,460,     Capitalisation of Internal Development Costs
10,460,As noted above accounting standards require companies to capitalise software development costs after a product s feasibility is established  Despite  this requirement judgment in determining feasibility means that companies  capitalisation practices may differ  For example as illustrated in Exhibit    Microsoft judges product feasibility to be established very shortly before manufacturing begins and therefore effectively expenses rather than  capitalises research and development costs 
11,460,Exhibit    Disclosure on Software Development Costs
12,460,Excerpt from Management s Discussion and Analysis  MD A  of Microsoft Corporation Application of Critical Accounting Policies  Research and Development Costs 
13,460,SFAS No     specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be  charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product  Once technological feasibility is  established all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers  Judgment is  required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established  We have determined that technological  feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and  testing  Generally this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing  The amortization of these costs is  included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
14,460,Source  Microsoft Corporation Annual Report      p     
15,460,Expensing rather than capitalising development costs results in lower net income in the current period  Expensing rather than capitalising will continue  to result in lower net income so long as the amount of the current period development expenses is higher than the amortisation expense that would  have resulted from amortising prior periods  capitalised development costs the typical situation when a company s development costs are increasing   On the statement of cash flows expensing rather than capitalising development costs results in lower net operating cash flows and higher net investing  cash flows  This is because the development costs are reflected as operating cash outflows rather than investing cash outflows 
16,460,In comparing the financial performance of a company that expenses most or all software development costs such as Microsoft with another company  that capitalises software development costs adjustments can be made to make the two comparable  For the company that capitalises software  development costs an analyst can adjust  a  the income statement to include software development costs as an expense and to exclude amortisation of  prior years  software development costs   b  the balance sheet to exclude capitalised software  decrease assets and equity   and  c  the statement of  cash flows to decrease operating cash flows and decrease cash used in investing by the amount of the current period development costs  Any ratios  that include income long lived assets or cash flow from operations such as return on equity will also be affected

2,462,  EPS  As reported EPS was        Adjusted EPS was        Expensing software development costs would have reduced JHH s       operating income by       but the company would have reported no amortisation of prior years  software costs which  would have increased operating income by        The net change of       would have reduced operating income from the  reported        to        The effective tax rate for                       is        and using this effective tax rate would  give an adjusted net income of                              compared to       before the adjustment  The EPS would  therefore be reduced from the reported       to        adjusted net income of       divided by      shares

6,462,  CFO per share as adjusted was        The company s       expenditure on software development costs was reported as a cash  outflow from investing activities so expensing those costs would reduce cash from operating activities by       from the  reported        to        Dividing adjusted total operating cash flow of       by      shares results in cash flow per share of        
7,462,C  Based on information as reported the EV EBITDA was                          Based on EBITDA adjusted to expense software  development costs the EV EBITDA was                         
8,462,  Enterprise Value  Enterprise value is the sum of the market value of the company s equity and debt  JHH has no debt and  therefore the enterprise value is equal to the market value of its equity  The market value of its equity is              per share         shares  
9,462,  EBITDA as reported was         earnings before interest and taxes of        plus       depreciation plus        amortisation  
10,462,  EBITDA adjusted for expensing software development costs by the inclusion of       development expense and the exclusion  of       amortisation of prior expense would be         earnings before interest and taxes of       plus       depreciation  plus    amortisation  
11,462,Solution to   
12,462,Expensing software development costs would decrease historical profits operating cash flow and EBITDA and would thus increase all  market multiples  So JHH s stock would appear more expensive if it expensed rather than capitalised the software development costs 
13,462,If the unadjusted market based ratios were used in the comparison of JHH to its competitor that expenses all software development  expenditures then JHH might appear to be under priced when the difference is solely related to accounting factors  JHH s adjusted market  based ratios provide a better basis for comparison 
14,462,For the company in Example   current period software development expenditures exceed the amortisation of prior periods  capitalised software  development expenditures  As a result expensing rather than capitalising software development costs would have the effect of lowering income  If  however software development expenditures slowed such that current expenditures were lower than the amortisation of prior periods  capitalised  software development expenditures then expensing software development costs would have the effect of increasing income relative to capitalising it 
15,462,This section illustrated how decisions about capitalising versus expensing impact financial statements and ratios  Earlier expensing lowers current  profits but enhances trends whereas capitalising now and expensing later enhances current profits  Having described the accounting for acquisition of  long lived assets we now turn to the topic of measuring long lived assets in subsequent periods 
16,462,   DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION OF LONG LIVED ASSETS
17,462,Under the cost model of reporting long lived assets which is permitted under IFRS and required under US GAAP the capitalised costs of long lived  tangible assets  other than land which is not depreciated  and intangible assets with finite useful lives are allocated to subsequent periods as  depreciation and amortisation expenses  Depreciation and amortisation are effectively the same concept with the term depreciation referring to the  process of allocating tangible assets  costs and the term amortisation referring to the process of allocating intangible assets  costs    The alternative  model of reporting long lived assets is the revaluation model which is permitted under IFRS but not under US GAAP  Under the revaluation model  a company reports the long lived asset at fair value rather than at acquisition cost  historical cost  less accumulated depreciation or amortisation as in  the cost model 
18,462,An asset s carrying amount is the amount at which the asset is reported on the balance sheet  Under the cost model at any point in time the carrying  amount  also called carrying value or net book value  of a long lived asset is equal to its historical cost minus the amount of depreciation or  amortisation that has been accumulated since the asset s purchase  assuming that the asset has not been impaired a topic which will be addressed in  Section     Companies may present on the balance sheet the total net amount of property plant and equipment and the total net amount of intangible  assets  However more detail is disclosed in the notes to financial statements  The details disclosed typically include the acquisition costs the  depreciation and amortisation expenses the accumulated depreciation and amortisation amounts the depreciation and amortisation methods used and  information on the assumptions used to depreciate and amortise long lived assets

2,463,     Depreciation Methods and Calculation of Depreciation Expense
3,463,Depreciation methods include the straight line method in which the cost of an asset is allocated to expense evenly over its useful life  accelerated  methods in which the allocation of cost is greater in earlier years  and the units of production method in which the allocation of cost  corresponds to the actual use of an asset in a particular period  The choice of depreciation method affects the amounts reported on the financial  statements including the amounts for reported assets and operating and net income  This in turn affects a variety of financial ratios including fixed  asset turnover total asset turnover operating profit margin operating return on assets and return on assets 
4,463,Using the straight line method depreciation expense is calculated as depreciable cost divided by estimated useful life and is the same for each period   Depreciable cost is the historical cost of the tangible asset minus the estimated residual  salvage  value    A commonly used accelerated method is the  declining balance method in which the amount of depreciation expense for a period is calculated as some percentage of the carrying amount  i e  cost  net of accumulated depreciation at the beginning of the period   When an accelerated method is used depreciable cost is not used to calculate the  depreciation expense but the carrying amount should not be reduced below the estimated residual value  In the units of production method the  amount of depreciation expense for a period is based on the proportion of the asset s production during the period compared with the total estimated  productive capacity of the asset over its useful life  The depreciation expense is calculated as depreciable cost times production in the period divided  by estimated productive capacity over the life of the asset  Equivalently the company may estimate a depreciation cost per unit  depreciable cost  divided by estimated productive capacity  and calculate depreciation expense as depreciation cost per unit times production in the period  Regardless  of the depreciation method used the carrying amount of the asset is not reduced below the estimated residual value  Example   provides an example  of these depreciation methods

11,464,For each company the following information applies  Beginning net book value in Year   equals the purchase price of        accumulated  year end depreciation equals the balance from the previous year plus the current year s depreciation expense  ending net book value  carrying  amount  equals original cost minus accumulated year end depreciation  which is the same as beginning net book value minus depreciation  expense   and beginning net book value in Years     and   equals the ending net book value of the prior year  The following text and filled in  templates describe how depreciation expense is calculated for each company

18,464,SOONER Inc  uses the double declining balance method  The depreciation rate for the double declining balance method is double the  depreciation rate for the straight line method  The depreciation rate under the straight line method is    percent      percent divided by    years   Thus the depreciation rate for the double declining balance method is    percent    times    percent   The depreciation expense for the  first year is           percent of         Note that under this method the depreciation rate of    percent is applied to the carrying amount   net book value  of the asset without adjustment for expected residual value  Because the carrying amount of the asset is not depreciated  below its estimated residual value however the depreciation expense in the final year of depreciation decreases the ending net book value   carrying amount  to the estimated residual value

3,465,All three methods result in the same total amount of accumulated depreciation over the life of the equipment  The significant differences are  simply in the timing of the recognition of the depreciation expense  The straight line method recognises the expense evenly the accelerated  method recognises most of the expense in the first year and the units of production method recognises the expense on the basis of production   or use of the asset   Under all three methods the ending net book value is

16,465,For all companies the asset turnover ratio increased over time because sales grew at a faster rate than that of the assets  SOONER had  consistently higher asset turnover ratios than the other two companies however because higher depreciation expense in the earlier periods  decreased its average total assets  In addition the higher depreciation in earlier periods resulted in SOONER having lower operating profit  margin and operating ROA in the first year and higher operating profit margin and operating ROA in the later periods  SOONER appears to be  more efficiently run on the basis of its higher asset turnover and greater increases in profit margin and ROA over time  however these  comparisons reflect differences in the companies  choice of depreciation method  In addition an analyst might question the sustainability of  the extremely high ROAs for all three companies because such high profitability levels would probably attract new competitors which would  likely put downward pressure on the ratios

18,466,In many countries a company must use the same depreciation methods for both financial and tax reporting  In other countries including the United  States a company need not use the same depreciation method for financial reporting and taxes  As a result of using different depreciation methods for  financial and tax reporting pre tax income on the income statement and taxable income on the tax return may differ  Thus the amount of tax expense  computed on the basis of pre tax income and the amount of taxes actually owed on the basis of taxable income may differ  Although these differences  eventually reverse because the total depreciation is the same regardless of the timing of its recognition in financial statements versus on tax returns  during the period of the difference the balance sheet will show what is known as deferred taxes  For instance if a company uses straight line  depreciation for financial reporting and an accelerated depreciation method for tax purposes the company s financial statements will report lower  depreciation expense and higher pre tax income in the first year compared with the amount of depreciation expense and taxable income in its tax  reporting   Compare the depreciation expense in Year   for EVEN LI Co  and SOONER Inc  in the previous example   Tax expense calculated on the  basis of the financial statements  pre tax income will be higher than taxes payable on the basis of taxable income  the difference between the two  amounts represents a deferred tax liability  The deferred tax liability will be reduced as the difference reverses  i e  when depreciation for financial  reporting is higher than the depreciation for tax purposes  and the income tax is paid 
19,466,Significant estimates required for calculating depreciation include the useful life of the asset  or its total lifetime productive capacity  and its expected  residual value at the end of that useful life  A longer useful life and higher expected residual value decrease the amount of annual depreciation expense  relative to a shorter useful life and lower expected residual value  Companies should review their estimates periodically to ensure they remain  reasonable  IFRS require companies to review estimates annually 
20,466,Although no significant differences exist between IFRS and US GAAP with respect to the definition of depreciation and the acceptable depreciation  methods IFRS require companies to use a component method of depreciation    Companies are required to separately depreciate the significant  components of an asset  parts of an item with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost and or with different useful lives  and thus require  additional estimates for the various components  For instance it may be appropriate to depreciate separately the engine frame and interior furnishings  of an aircraft  Under US GAAP the component method of depreciation is allowed but is seldom used in practice    The following example illustrates  depreciating components of an asset 
21,466,EXAMPLE  
22,466,Illustration of Depreciating Components of an Asset
23,466,CUTITUP Co  a hypothetical company purchases a milling machine a type of machine used for shaping metal at a total cost of                was estimated to represent the cost of the rotating cutter a significant component of the machine  The company expects the machine to  have a useful life of eight years and a residual value of       and that the rotating cutter will need to be replaced every two years  Assume the  entire residual value is attributable to the milling machine itself and assume the company uses straight line depreciation for all assets 
24,466,   How much depreciation expense would the company report in Year   if it uses the component method of depreciation and how much  depreciation expense would the company report in Year   if it does not use the component method 
25,466,   Assuming a new cutter with an estimated two year useful life is purchased at the end of Year   for       what depreciation expenses  would the company report in Year   if it uses the component method and if it does not use the component method

2,467,Solution to   
3,467,Depreciation expense in Year   under the component method would be        For the portion of the machine excluding the cutter the  depreciable base is total cost minus the cost attributable to the cutter minus the estimated residual value                                    Depreciation expense for the machine excluding the cutter in the first year equals       depreciable cost divided by the useful life of the  machine           years   For the cutter the depreciation expense equals        depreciable cost divided by the useful life of the cutter            years   Thus the total depreciation expense for Year   under the component method is        the sum of the depreciation expenses  of the two components                  Depreciation expense in Year   would also be       
4,467,If the company does not use the component method depreciation expense in Year   is       the depreciable cost of the total milling machine  divided by its useful life                      years   Depreciation expense in Year   would also be      
5,467,Solution to   
6,467,Assuming that at the end of Year   the company purchases a new cutter for       with an estimated two year life under the component  method the depreciation expense in Year   will remain at        If the company does not use the component method and purchases a new  cutter with an estimated two year life for       at the end of Year   the depreciation expense in Year   will be

8,467,Over the eight years assuming replacement of the cutters every two years at a price of       the total depreciation expense will be                    years  when the component method is used  When the component method is not used the total depreciation expense will also be                   years             years   This amount equals the total expenditures of                    cutters          less the  residual value of

10,467,The following table summarizes the estimates required in the first year to compute depreciation expense if the company does or does not use  the component method

12,467,Total depreciation expense may be allocated between the cost of sales and other expenses  Within the income statement depreciation expense of  assets used in production is usually allocated to the cost of sales and the depreciation expense of assets not used in production may be allocated to  some other expense category  For instance depreciation expense may be allocated to selling general and administrative expenses if depreciable assets  are used in those functional areas  Notes to the financial statements sometimes disclose information regarding which income statement line items  include depreciation expense although the exact amount of detail disclosed by individual companies varies 
13,467,     Amortisation Methods and Calculation of Amortisation Expense
14,467,Amortisation is similar in concept to depreciation  The term amortisation applies to intangible assets and the term depreciation applies to tangible  assets  Both terms refer to the process of allocating the cost of an asset over the asset s useful life  Only those intangible assets assumed to have finite  useful lives are amortised over their useful lives following the pattern in which the benefits are used up  Acceptable amortisation methods are the  same as the methods acceptable for depreciation  Assets assumed to have an indefinite useful life  in other words without a finite useful life  are not  amortised  An intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite useful life when there is  no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is  expected to generate net cash inflows  for the company   
15,467,Intangible assets with finite useful lives include an acquired customer list expected to provide benefits to a direct mail marketing company for two to  three years an acquired patent or copyright with a specific expiration date an acquired license with a specific expiration date and no right to renew the  license and an acquired trademark for a product that a company plans to phase out over a specific number of years  Examples of intangible assets with  indefinite useful lives include an acquired license that although it has a specific expiration date can be renewed at little or no cost and an acquired  trademark that although it has a specific expiration can be renewed at a minimal cost and relates to a product that a company plans to continue selling  for the foreseeable future 
16,467,As with depreciation for a tangible asset the calculation of amortisation for an intangible asset requires the original amount at which the intangible  asset is recognised and estimates of the length of its useful life and its residual value at the end of its useful life  Useful lives are estimated on the basis  of the expected use of the asset considering any factors that may limit the life of the asset such as legal regulatory contractual competitive or  economic factors 
17,467,EXAMPLE   
18,467,Amortisation Expense
19,467,IAS    Intangible Assets provides illustrative examples regarding the accounting for intangible assets including the following

1,468,    yang lu  yolandalulu outlook com                                                 
2,468,A direct mail marketing company acquires a customer list and expects that it will be able to derive benefit from the information on  the list for at least one year but no more than three years  The customer list would be amortised over management s best estimate  of its useful life say    months  Although the direct mail marketing company may intend to add customer names and other  information to the list in the future the expected benefits of the acquired customer list relate only to the customers on that list at  the date it was acquired 
3,468,In this example in what ways would management s decisions and estimates affect the company s financial statements 
4,468,Solution 
5,468,Because the acquired customer list is expected to generate future economic benefits for a period greater than one year the cost of the list  should be capitalised and not expensed  The acquired customer list is determined to not have an indefinite life and must be amortised   Management must estimate the useful life of the customer list and must select an amortisation method  In this example the list appears to have  no residual value  Both the amortisation method and the estimated useful life affect the amount of the amortisation expense in each period  A  shorter estimated useful life compared with a longer estimated useful life results in a higher amortisation expense each year over a shorter  period but the total accumulated amortisation expense over the life of the intangible asset is unaffected by the estimate of the useful life   Similarly the total accumulated amortisation expense over the life of the intangible asset is unaffected by the choice of amortisation method   The amortisation expense per period depends on the amortisation method  If the straight line method is used the amortisation expense is the  same for each year of useful life  If an accelerated method is used the amortisation expense will be higher in earlier years 
6,468,   THE REVALUATION MODEL
7,468,The revaluation model is an alternative to the cost model for the periodic valuation and reporting of long lived assets  IFRS permit the use of either the  revaluation model or the cost model but the revaluation model is not allowed under US GAAP  Revaluation changes the carrying amounts of classes  of long lived assets to fair value  the fair value must be measured reliably   Under the cost model carrying amounts are historical costs less  accumulated depreciation or amortisation  Under the revaluation model carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any  subsequent accumulated depreciation or amortisation 
8,468,IFRS allow companies to value long lived assets either under a cost model at historical cost minus accumulated depreciation or amortisation or under  a revaluation model at fair value  In contrast US accounting standards require that the cost model be used  A key difference between the two models  is that the cost model allows only decreases in the values of long lived assets compared with historical costs but the revaluation model may result in  increases in the values of long lived assets to amounts greater than historical costs 
9,468,IFRS allow a company to use the cost model for some classes of assets and the revaluation model for others but the company must apply the same  model to all assets within a particular class of assets and must revalue all items within a class to avoid selective revaluation  Examples of different  classes of assets include land land and buildings machinery motor vehicles furniture and fixtures and office equipment  The revaluation model may  be used for classes of intangible assets but only if an active market for the assets exists because the revaluation model may only be used if the fair  values of the assets can be measured reliably  For practical purposes the revaluation model is rarely used for either tangible or intangible assets but its  use is especially rare for intangible assets 
10,468,Under the revaluation model whether an asset revaluation affects earnings depends on whether the revaluation initially increases or decreases an asset  class  carrying amount  If a revaluation initially decreases the carrying amount of the asset class the decrease is recognised in profit or loss  Later if  the carrying amount of the asset class increases the increase is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the  same asset class previously recognised in profit or loss  Any increase in excess of the reversal amount will not be recognised in the income statement  but will be recorded directly to equity in a revaluation surplus account  An upward revaluation is treated the same as the amount in excess of the  reversal amount  In other words if a revaluation initially increases the carrying amount of the asset class the increase in the carrying amount of the  asset class bypasses the income statement and goes directly to equity under the heading of revaluation surplus  Any subsequent decrease in the asset s  value first decreases the revaluation surplus and then goes to income  When an asset is retired or disposed of any related amount of revaluation  surplus included in equity is transferred directly to retained earnings 
11,468,Asset revaluations offer several considerations for financial statement analyses  First an increase in the carrying amount of depreciable long lived  assets increases total assets and shareholders  equity so asset revaluations that increase the carrying amount of an asset can be used to reduce reported  leverage  Defining leverage as average total assets divided by average shareholders  equity increasing both the numerator  assets  and denominator   equity  by the same amount leads to a decline in the ratio   Mathematically when a ratio is greater than one as in this case an increase in both the  numerator and the denominator by the same amount leads to a decline in the ratio   Therefore the leverage motivation for the revaluation should be  considered in analysis  For example a company may revalue assets up if it is seeking new capital or approaching leverage limitations set by financial  covenants 
12,468,Second assets revaluations that decrease the carrying amount of the assets reduce net income  In the year of the revaluation profitability measures  such as return on assets and return on equity decline  However because total assets and shareholders  equity are also lower the company may appear  more profitable in future years  Additionally reversals of downward revaluations also go through income thus increasing earnings  Managers can then  opportunistically time the reversals to manage earnings and increase income  Third asset revaluations that increase the carrying amount of an asset  initially increase depreciation expense total assets and shareholders  equity  Therefore profitability measures such as return on assets and return on  equity would decline  Although upward asset revaluations also generally decrease income  through higher depreciation expense  the increase in the  value of the long lived asset is presumably based on increases in the operating capacity of the asset which will likely be evidenced in increased future  revenues 
13,468,Finally an analyst should consider who did the appraisal i e  an independent external appraiser or management and how often revaluations are  made  Appraisals of the fair value of long lived assets involve considerable judgment and discretion  Presumably appraisals of assets from  independent external sources are more reliable  How often assets are revalued can provide an indicator of whether their reported value continues to be  representative of their fair values 
14,468,The next two examples illustrate revaluation of long lived assets under IFRS

4,470,   IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS
5,470,In contrast with depreciation and amortisation charges which serve to allocate the depreciable cost of a long lived asset over its useful life  impairment charges reflect an unanticipated decline in the value of an asset  Both IFRS and US GAAP require companies to write down the carrying  amount of impaired assets  Impairment reversals for identifiable long lived assed are permitted under IFRS but typically not under US GAAP 
6,470,An asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount   the higher of fair value less cost to sell or value in  use  according to IAS    Impairment of Assets  or under US GAAP when its carrying amount exceeds its fair value  Under US GAAP however  impairment losses are only recognisable when the carrying amount of the impaired asset is determined to be not recoverable  Therefore in general  impairment losses are recognised when the asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  However IFRS and US GAAP define recoverability  differently  The following paragraphs describe accounting for impairment for different categories of assets 
7,470,     Impairment of Property Plant and Equipment
8,470,Accounting standards do not require that property plant and equipment be tested annually for impairment  Rather at the end of each reporting period   generally a fiscal year  a company assesses whether there are indications of asset impairment  If there is no indication of impairment the asset is not  tested for impairment  If there is an indication of impairment such as evidence of obsolescence decline in demand for products or technological  advancements the recoverable amount of the asset should be measured in order to test for impairment  For property plant and equipment impairment  losses are recognised when the asset s carrying amount is not recoverable  the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount  The amount of  the impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet and will reduce net income on the income statement  The  impairment loss is a non cash item and will not affect cash from operations 
9,470,IFRS and US GAAP differ somewhat both in the guidelines for determining that impairment has occurred and in the measurement of an impairment  loss  Under IAS    an impairment loss is measured as the excess of carrying amount over the recoverable amount of the asset  The recoverable  amount of an asset is defined as  the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use   Value in use is a discounted measure of expected  future cash flows  Under US GAAP assessing recoverability is separate from measuring the impairment loss  An asset s carrying amount is  considered not recoverable when it exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows  If the asset s carrying amount is considered not recoverable  the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset s fair value and carrying amount 
10,470,EXAMPLE   
11,470,Impairment of Property Plant and Equipment
12,470,Sussex a hypothetical manufacturing company in the United Kingdom has a machine it uses to produce a single product  The demand for the  product has declined substantially since the introduction of a competing product  The company has assembled the following information with  respect to the machine 
13,470,Carrying amount        Undiscounted expected future cash flows        Present value of expected future cash flows        Fair value if sold        Costs to sell      
14,470,   Under IFRS what would the company report for the machine 
15,470,   Under US GAAP what would the company report for the machine 
16,470,Solution to   
17,470,Under IFRS the company would compare the carrying amount          with the higher of its fair value less costs to sell          and its  value in use           The carrying amount exceeds the value in use the higher of the two amounts by        The machine would be  written down to the recoverable amount of        and a loss of       would be reported in the income statement  The carrying amount of  the machine is now         A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of        would be developed 
18,470,Solution to   
19,470,Under US GAAP the carrying amount          is compared with the undiscounted expected future cash flows           The carrying  amount is less than the undiscounted expected future cash flows so the carrying amount is considered recoverable  The machine would  continue to be carried at        and no loss would be reported 
20,470,In Example    a write down in the value of a piece of property plant and equipment occurred under IFRS but not under US GAAP  In Example     a write down occurs under both IFRS and US GAAP

3,471,Impairment of Property Plant and Equipment
4,471,Essex a hypothetical manufacturing company has a machine it uses to produce a single product  The demand for the product has declined  substantially since the introduction of a competing product  The company has assembled the following information with respect to the  machine 
5,471,Carrying amount        Undiscounted expected future cash flows        Present value of expected future cash flows        Fair value if sold        Costs to sell      
6,471,   Under IFRS what would the company report for the machine 
7,471,   Under US GAAP what would the company report for the machine 
8,471,Solution to   
9,471,Under IFRS the company would compare the carrying amount          with the higher of its fair value less costs to sell         and its  value in use           The carrying amount exceeds the value in use the higher of the two amounts by        The machine would be  written down to the recoverable amount of        and a loss of       would be reported in the income statement  The carrying amount of  the machine is now         A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of        would be developed 
10,471,Solution to   
11,471,Under US GAAP the carrying amount          is compared with the undiscounted expected future cash flows           The carrying  amount exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows so the carrying amount is considered not recoverable  The machine would be  written down to fair value of        and a loss of       would be reported in the income statement  The carrying amount of the machine is  now         A new depreciation schedule based on the carrying amount of        would be developed 
12,471,Example    shows that the write down to value in use under IFRS can be less than the write down to fair value under US GAAP  The difference in  recognition of impairment losses is ultimately reflected in difference in book value of equity 
13,471,     Impairment of Intangible Assets with a Finite Life
14,471,Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised  carrying amount decreases over time  and may become impaired  As is the case with property plant  and equipment the assets are not tested annually for impairment  Instead they are tested only when significant events suggest the need to test  The  company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether a significant event suggesting the need to test for impairment has occurred  Examples of  such events include a significant decrease in the market price or a significant adverse change in legal or economic factors  Impairment accounting for  intangible assets with a finite life is essentially the same as for tangible assets  the amount of the impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount of  the asset on the balance sheet and will reduce net income on the income statement 
15,471,     Impairment of Intangibles with Indefinite Lives
16,471,Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortised  Instead they are carried on the balance sheet at historical cost but are tested at least annually  for impairment  Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
17,471,     Impairment of Long Lived Assets Held for Sale
18,471,A long lived  non current  asset is reclassified as held for sale rather than held for use when it ceases to be used and management s intent is to sell it   For instance if a building ceases to be used and management s intent is to sell it the building is reclassified from property plant and equipment to  non current assets held for sale  At the time of reclassification assets previously held for use are tested for impairment  If the carrying amount at the  time of reclassification exceeds the fair value less costs to sell an impairment loss is recognised and the asset is written down to fair value less costs to  sell  Long lived assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortised 
19,471,     Reversals of Impairments of Long Lived Assets
20,471,After an asset has been deemed impaired and an impairment loss has been reported the asset s recoverable amount could potentially increase  For  instance a lawsuit appeal may successfully challenge a patent infringement by another company with the result that a patent previously written down  has a higher recoverable amount  IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed if the recoverable amount of an asset increases regardless of whether  the asset is classified as held for use or held for sale  Note that IFRS permit the reversal of impairment losses only  IFRS do not permit the revaluation  to the recoverable amount if the recoverable amount exceeds the previous carrying amount  Under US GAAP the accounting for reversals of  impairments depends on whether the asset is classified as held for use or held for sale    Under US GAAP once an impairment loss has been  recognised for assets held for use it cannot be reversed  In other words once the value of an asset held for use has been decreased by an impairment  charge it cannot be increased  For assets held for sale if the fair value increases after an impairment loss the loss can be reversed

2,472,   DERECOGNITION
3,472,A company derecognises an asset  i e  removes it from the financial statements  when the asset is disposed of or is expected to provide no future  benefits from either use or disposal  A company may dispose of a long lived operating asset by selling it exchanging it or abandoning it  As  previously described non current assets that are no longer in use and are to be sold are reclassified as non current assets held for sale 
4,472,     Sale of Long Lived Assets
5,472,The gain or loss on the sale of long lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale  An asset s  carrying amount is typically the net book value  i e  the historical cost minus accumulated depreciation  unless the asset s carrying amount has been  changed to reflect impairment and or revaluation as previously discussed 
6,472,EXAMPLE   
7,472,Calculation of Gain or Loss on the Sale of Long Lived Assets
8,472,Moussilauke Diners Inc  a hypothetical company as a result of revamping its menus to focus on healthier food items sells     used pizza  ovens and reports a gain on the sale of      million  The ovens had a carrying amount of      million  original cost of      million less       million of accumulated depreciation   At what price did Moussilauke sell the ovens 
9,472,A       million
10,472,B       million
11,472,C       million
12,472,Solution 
13,472,B is correct  The ovens had a carrying amount of      million and Moussilauke recognised a gain of      million  Therefore Moussilauke  sold the ovens at a price of      million  The gain on the sale of      million is the selling price of      million minus the carrying amount of       million  Ignoring taxes the cash flow from the sale is      million which would appear as a cash inflow from investing 
14,472,A gain or loss on the sale of an asset is disclosed on the income statement either as a component of other gains and losses or in a separate line item  when the amount is material  A company typically discloses further detail about the sale in the management discussion and analysis and or financial  statement footnotes  In addition a statement of cash flows prepared using the indirect method adjusts net income to remove any gain or loss on the  sale from operating cash flow and to include the amount of proceeds from the sale in cash from investing activities  Recall that the indirect method of  the statement of cash flows begins with net income and makes all adjustments to arrive at cash from operations including removal of gains or losses  from non operating activities 
15,472,     Long Lived Assets Disposed of Other Than by a Sale
16,472,Long lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale  e g  abandoned exchanged for another asset or distributed to owners in a spin off  are  classified as held for use until disposal    Thus the long lived assets continue to be depreciated and tested for impairment unless their carrying  amount is zero as required for other long lived assets owned by the company 
17,472,When an asset is retired or abandoned the accounting is similar to a sale except that the company does not record cash proceeds  Assets are reduced  by the carrying amount of the asset at the time of retirement or abandonment and a loss equal to the asset s carrying amount is recorded 
18,472,When an asset is exchanged accounting for the exchange typically involves removing the carrying amount of the asset given up adding a fair value  for the asset acquired and reporting any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value as a gain or loss  The fair value used is the fair  value of the asset given up unless the fair value of the asset acquired is more clearly evident  If no reliable measure of fair value exists the acquired  asset is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up  A gain is reported when the fair value used for the newly acquired asset exceeds the  carrying amount of the asset given up  A loss is reported when the fair value used for the newly acquired asset is less than the carrying amount of the  asset given up  If the acquired asset is valued at the carrying amount of the asset given up because no reliable measure of fair value exists no gain or  loss is reported 
19,472,When a spin off occurs typically an entire cash generating unit of a company with all its assets is spun off  As an illustration of a spin off Altria  Group Inc  effected a spin off of Kraft Foods on    March      by distributing about    percent of Kraft s shares to Altria s shareholders  The  company prepared unaudited pro forma income statements and balance sheets  for illustrative purposes only  as if the spin off had occurred at the  beginning of the year  Exhibit   summarizes information from the asset portion of the company s pro forma balance sheets  The items in the column  labeled  Spin off of Kraft  reflect Kraft s assets being removed from Altria s balance sheet at the time of the spin off  For example Kraft s property  plant and equipment  net of depreciation  totaled      billion

15,473,   PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURES
16,473,Under IFRS for each class of property plant and equipment a company must disclose the measurement bases the depreciation method the useful  lives  or equivalently the depreciation rate  used the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation at the beginning and end of the period  and a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period    In addition disclosures of restrictions on title and pledges as  security of property plant and equipment and contractual agreements to acquire property plant and equipment are required  If the revaluation model  is used the date of revaluation details of how the fair value was obtained the carrying amount under the cost model and the revaluation surplus must  be disclosed 
17,473,The disclosure requirements under US GAAP are less exhaustive    A company must disclose the depreciation expense for the period the balances of  major classes of depreciable assets accumulated depreciation by major classes or in total and a general description of the depreciation method s  used  in computing depreciation expense with respect to the major classes of depreciable assets 
18,473,Under IFRS for each class of intangible assets a company must disclose whether the useful lives are indefinite or finite  If finite for each class of  intangible asset a company must disclose the useful lives  or equivalently the amortisation rate  used the amortisation methods used the gross  carrying amount and the accumulated amortisation at the beginning and end of the period where amortisation is included on the income statement  and a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period    If an asset has an indefinite life the company must disclose the  carrying amount of the asset and why it is considered to have an indefinite life  Similar to property plant and equipment disclosures of restrictions on  title and pledges as security of intangible assets and contractual agreements to acquire intangible assets are required  If the revaluation model is used  the date of revaluation details of how the fair value was obtained the carrying amount under the cost model and the revaluation surplus must be  disclosed 
19,473,Under US GAAP companies are required to disclose the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortisation in total and by major class of  intangible assets the aggregate amortisation expense for the period and the estimated amortisation expense for the next five fiscal years   
20,473,The disclosures related to impairment losses also differ under IFRS and US GAAP  Under IFRS a company must disclose for each class of assets the  amounts of impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses recognised in the period and where those are recognised on the financial  statements    The company must also disclose in aggregate the main classes of assets affected by impairment losses and reversals of impairment  losses and the main events and circumstances leading to recognition of these impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses  Under US GAAP  there is no reversal of impairment losses  The company must disclose a description of the impaired asset what led to the impairment the method of  determining fair value the amount of the impairment loss and where the loss is recognised on the financial statements   
21,473,Disclosures about long lived assets appear throughout the financial statements  in the balance sheet the income statement the statement of cash flows  and the notes  The balance sheet reports the carrying value of the asset  For the income statement depreciation expense may or may not appear as a  separate line item  Under IFRS whether the income statement discloses depreciation expense separately depends on whether the company is using a   nature of expense  method or a  function of expense  method  Under the nature of expense method a company aggregates expenses  according to  their nature  for example depreciation purchases of materials transport costs employee benefits and advertising costs  and does not reallocate them  among functions within the entity     Under the function of expense method a company classifies expenses according to the function for example as  part of cost of sales or of SG A  selling general and administrative expenses   At a minimum a company using the function of expense method  must disclose cost of sales but the other line items vary 
22,473,The statement of cash flows reflects acquisitions and disposals of fixed assets in the investing section  In addition when prepared using the indirect  method the statement of cash flows typically shows depreciation expense  or depreciation plus amortisation  as a line item in the adjustments of net  income to cash flow from operations  The notes to the financial statements describe the company s accounting method s  the range of estimated  useful lives historical cost by main category of fixed asset accumulated depreciation and annual depreciation expense

2,477,Solution to   
3,477,Impairment losses are reported on the consolidated income statement  Exhibit     Impairment losses reduce the value of the assets impaired   Note    and are thus recognised within the consolidated balance sheet  Amortisation is included within the cost of sales line within the  consolidated income statement  Note

6,477,Solution to   
7,477,C is correct  The gains and losses arising in the year on asset revaluation are recognised directly in equity and shown on the consolidated  statement of recognised income and expense  They are also reported in the notes to the financial statements  Note     
8,477,Note that the exhibits in the previous example contain relatively brief excerpts from the company s disclosures  The complete text of the disclosures  concerning the company s non current assets spans seven different footnotes most of which are several pages long  In addition to information about  the discount rate and other assumptions used to calculate impairment charges the disclosures provide information about the sensitivity of impairment  charges to changes in the assumptions 
9,477,Overall an analyst can use the disclosures to understand a company s investments in tangible and intangible assets how those investments changed  during a reporting period how those changes affected current performance and what those changes might indicate about future performance 
10,477,Ratios used in analyzing fixed assets include the fixed asset turnover ratio and several asset age ratios  The fixed asset turnover ratio  total revenue  divided by average net fixed assets  reflects the relationship between total revenues and investment in PPE  The higher this ratio the higher the  amount of sales a company is able to generate with a given amount of investment in fixed assets  A higher asset turnover ratio is often interpreted as  an indicator of greater efficiency 
11,477,Asset age ratios generally rely on the relationship between historical cost and depreciation  Under the revaluation model  permitted under IFRS but  not US GAAP  the relationship between carrying amount accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense will differ when the carrying amount  differs significantly from the depreciated historical cost  Therefore the following discussion of asset age ratios applies primarily to PPE reported  under the cost model 
12,477,Asset age and remaining useful life two asset age ratios are important indicators of a company s need to reinvest in productive capacity  The older  the assets and the shorter the remaining life the more a company may need to reinvest to maintain productive capacity  The average age of a  company s asset base can be estimated as accumulated depreciation divided by depreciation expense  The average remaining life of a company s asset  base can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense  These estimates simply reflect the following relationships for assets accounted for  on a historical cost basis  total historical cost minus accumulated depreciation equals net PPE  and under straight line depreciation total historical  cost less salvage value divided by estimated useful life equals annual depreciation expense  Equivalently total historical cost less salvage value  divided by annual depreciation expense equals estimated useful life  Assuming straight line depreciation and no salvage value  for simplicity  we  have the following 
13,477,Estimated total useful life   Time elapsed since purchase  Age    Estimated remaining life Historical cost   annual depreciation expense   Estimated total useful life Historical cost   Accumulated depreciation
14,477,  Net PPE
15,477,Equivalently
16,477,Estimated total useful life Historical cost   annual depreciation expense
17,477,  Estimated age of equipment   Estimated remaining life   Accumulated depreciation   annual depreciation expense   Net PPE   annual depreciation expense
18,477,The application of these estimates can be illustrated by a hypothetical example of a company with a single depreciable asset  Assume the asset initially  cost      had an estimated useful life of    years and an estimated salvage value of     Each year the company records a depreciation expense of      so accumulated depreciation will equal     times the number of years since the asset was acquired  when the asset is   years old accumulated  depreciation will be       Equivalently the age of the asset will equal accumulated depreciation divided by the annual depreciation expense 
19,477,In practice such estimates are difficult to make with great precision  Companies use depreciation methods other than the straight line method and  have numerous assets with varying useful lives and salvage values including some assets that are fully depreciated so this approach produces an  estimate only  Moreover fixed asset disclosures are often quite general  Consequently these estimates may be primarily useful to identify areas for  further investigation 
20,477,One further measure compares a company s current reinvestment in productive capacity  Comparing annual capital expenditures to annual  depreciation expense provides an indication of whether productive capacity is being maintained  It is a very general indicator of the rate at which a  company is replacing its PPE relative to the rate at which PPE is being depreciated

39,478,The computations are explained using UPM s data  The estimated total useful life of PPE is total historical cost of PPE of        divided by  annual depreciation expense of      giving      years  Estimated age and estimated remaining life are obtained by dividing accumulated  depreciation of        and net PPE of       by the annual depreciation expense of      giving      years and     years respectively 
40,478,Ideally the estimates of asset lives illustrated in this example should exclude land which is not depreciable when the information is available   however IP does not separately disclose land  We will use UPM for which land appeared to be disclosed separately in the above table to  illustrate the estimates with adjusting for land  As an illustration of the calculations to exclude land excluding UPM s land would give an  estimated total useful life for the non land PPE of      years   total cost        minus land cost of       divided by annual depreciation  expense of      million

2,479,Solution to   
3,479,The estimated total useful life suggests that IP and UPM depreciate PPE over a much longer period than ABY       and      years for IP and  UPM respectively versus      years for ABY  This result can be compared to an extent to the useful life of assets noted by the companies  and the composition of fixed assets  For instance ABY and UPM depreciate their buildings over similar periods and their equipment over the  same period    to    years   That the estimated useful life of PPE overall differs so much between the companies suggests that equipment  reflects a higher proportion of ABY s assets  An inspection of the companies  footnoted information  not shown above  on asset composition  confirms that equipment accounts for a larger portion of ABY gross fixed assets       compared to UPM       
4,479,The estimated age of the equipment suggests that ABY has the newest PPE with an estimated age of     years  Additionally the estimates  suggest that around    percent of ABY s assets  useful lives have passed      years        years or equivalently C      million   C       million   In comparison around    percent of the useful lives of the PPE of UPM have passed  Items that can affect comparisons across the  companies include business differences such as differences in composition of the companies  operations and differences in acquisition and  divestiture activity  In addition the companies all report under different accounting standards and IP discloses that it uses the units of  production method for the largest component of its PPE  Differences in disclosures e g  in the categories of assets disclosed also can affect  comparisons 
5,479,Solution to   
6,479,Capital expenditure as a percentage of depreciation is    percent for ABY    percent for IP and    percent for UPM  Based on this measure  IP and UPM are replacing their PPE at rates closer to the rate PPE are being depreciated  ABY s measure suggests the company is replacing its  PPE at a slower rate than the PPE is being depreciated consistent with the company s apparently newer asset base 
7,479,Solution to   
8,479,Fixed asset turnover for each company is presented below calculated as total revenues divided by average net PPE  Net sales is used as an  approximation for total revenues because differences like sales returns are not consistently disclosed by companies  We can see that IP s fixed  asset turnover is highest implying it is able to generate more sales from each unit of investment in fixed assets

11,479,   INVESTMENT PROPERTY
12,479,Investment property is defined under IFRS as property that is owned  or in some cases leased under a finance lease  for the purpose of earning rentals  or capital appreciation or both    An example of investment property is a building owned by a company and leased out to tenants  In contrast other  long lived tangible assets  i e  property considered to be property plant and equipment  are owner occupied properties used for producing the  company s goods and services or for housing the company s administrative activities  Investment properties do not include long lived tangible assets  held for sale in the ordinary course of business  For example the houses and property owned by a housing construction company are considered to be  its inventory 
13,479,Under IFRS companies are allowed to value investment properties using either a cost model or a fair value model  The cost model is identical to the  cost model used for property plant and equipment  If the cost model is used the fair value of investment property must be disclosed    The fair value  model however differs from the revaluation model used for property plant and equipment  Under the revaluation model whether an asset  revaluation affects net income depends on whether the revaluation initially increases or decreases the carrying amount of the asset  In contrast under  the fair value model all changes in the fair value of the asset affect net income  To use the fair value model a company must be able to reliably  determine the property s fair value on a continuing basis

8,480,   Do the valuation gains and losses on investment properties indicate that the properties have been sold 
9,480,Solution to   
10,480,The primary cause of the company s net operating loss for the year ended    March      was the net valuation loss on investment properties   The net valuation loss of      million  valuation gain of       thousand minus the valuation loss of         thousand  exceeded the  company s net rental income plus its profit on disposal of investment properties 
11,480,Solution to   
12,480,The primary cause of the company s net operating profit for the year ended    March      was the     million net rental income   Additionally the company reported net valuation gains on investment properties of     million  valuation gain of        thousand minus the  valuation loss of        thousand  and profit on disposal of investment properties of    million 
13,480,Solution to   
14,480,The change from a net operating profit to a net operating loss was primarily due to valuation gains exceeding valuation losses  net valuation  gains  in      and valuation losses significantly exceeding valuation gains  net valuation losses  in      
15,480,Solution to   
16,480,No  The valuation gains and losses on investment properties arise from changes in the fair value of properties that are owned by the company   The gains and losses on properties that have been sold are reported as Profit  Loss  on Disposal of Investment Properties  In neither      nor       did the company experience a loss on disposal of investment properties so the line item was reported as Profit on Disposal of Investment  Properties 
17,480,In general a company must apply its chosen model  cost or fair value  to all of its investment property  If a company chooses the fair value model for  its investment property it must continue to use the fair value model until it disposes of the property or changes its use such that it is no longer  considered investment property  e g  it becomes owner occupied property or part of inventory   The company must continue to use the fair value  model for that property even if transactions on comparable properties used to estimate fair value become less frequent 
18,480,Certain valuation issues arise when a company changes the use of property such that it moves from being an investment property to owner occupied  property or part of inventory  If a company s chosen model for investment property is the cost model such transfers do not change the carrying  amount of the property transferred  If a company s chosen model is the fair value model transfers from investment property to owner occupied  property or to inventory are made at fair value  In other words the property s fair value at the time of transfer is considered to be its cost for ongoing  accounting for the property  If a company s chosen model for investment property is the fair value model and it transfers a property from owner  occupied to investment property the change in measurement of the property from depreciated cost to fair value is treated like a revaluation  If a  company s chosen model is the fair value model and it transfers a property from inventory to investment property any difference between the  inventory carrying amount and the property s fair value at the time of transfer is recognised as profit or loss 
19,480,Investment property appears as a separate line item on the balance sheet  Companies are required to disclose whether they use the fair value model or  the cost model for their investment property  If the company uses the fair value model it must make additional disclosures about how it determines  fair value and must provide reconciliation between the beginning and ending carrying amounts of investment property  If the company uses the cost  model it must make additional disclosures similar to those for property plant and equipment for example the depreciation method and useful lives  must be disclosed  In addition if the company uses the cost model it must also disclose the fair value of investment property 
20,480,Under US GAAP there is no specific definition of investment property  Most operating companies and real estate companies in the United States that  hold investment type property use the historical cost model

2,481,   LEASING
3,481,A lease is a contract between the owner of an asset the lessor and another party seeking use of the assets the lessee  Through the lease the  lessor grants the right to use the asset to the lessee  The right to use the asset can be a long period such as    years or a much shorter period such as a  month  In exchange for the right to use the asset the lessee makes periodic lease payments to the lessor  A lease then is a form of financing to the  lessee provided by the lessor that enables the lessee to purchase the use of the leased asset 
4,481,     The Lease versus Buy Decision
5,481,There are several advantages to leasing an asset compared to purchasing it  Leases can provide less costly financing usually require little if any down  payment and are often at fixed interest rates  The negotiated lease contract may contain less restrictive provisions than other forms of borrowing  A  lease can also reduce the risks of obsolescence residual value and disposition to the lessee because the lessee does not own the asset  The lessor may  be better positioned to manage servicing the asset and to take advantage of tax benefits of ownership  As a result leasing the asset may be less costly  than owning the asset for the lessee 
6,481,Leases also have perceived financial and tax reporting advantages  While providing a form of financing certain types of leases are not reported as debt  on the balance sheet  The items leased under these types of leases also do not appear as assets on the balance sheet  Therefore no interest expense or  depreciation expense is included in the income statement  Additionally in some countries such as the United States financial reporting standards may  differ from reporting under tax regulations  thus in some cases a company may own an asset for tax purposes  and thus obtain deductions for  depreciation expense for tax purposes  while not reflecting the ownership in its financial statements  A lease that is structured to provide a company  with the tax benefits of ownership while not requiring the asset to be reflected on the company s financial statements is known as a synthetic lease 
7,481,     Finance versus Operating Leases
8,481,Differences in economic substance and accounting have traditionally existed for two main types of leases finance and operating  The economic  substance of a finance  or capital    lease has been regarded as different from an operating lease as are the implications of each for the financial  statements of the lessee and lessor  In substance a finance lease is equivalent to the purchase of an asset  lease to own  by the buyer  lessee  that is  directly financed by the seller  lessor   An operating lease is an agreement allowing the lessee to use the asset for a period of time similar to a  rental 
9,481,Under previous international accounting standards if substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee the  lease was classified as a finance lease  Otherwise the lease was reported as an operating lease  Under the new international accounting standard  IFRS      the lessee is required to recognize leases of more than    months duration  other than small asset leases  on the balance sheet and the lessee can  no longer classify a lease as an operating lease  The lessor continues to classify its leases as operating or finance leases under IFRS    
10,481,While a similar principle of the transfer of benefits and risks guides US GAAP US accounting standards have been more prescriptive in their criteria  for classifying finance and operating leases  Under US GAAP a lease that meets any one of four specific requirements is classified as a finance  lease    however the new accounting standard  ASC Topic      requires the lessee to recognize a liability for its lease obligation  initially measured  at the present value of the future lease payments not yet paid over the lease term  and an asset for its right to use the underlying asset equal to the  lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement lease incentives and any initial direct costs 
11,481,The example below illustrates and compares the accounting and financial statement effects of buying an asset using debt leasing an asset under an  operating lease and leasing an asset under a finance lease  Under IFRS    the treatment of operating leases is similar to finance leases 
12,481,EXAMPLE   
13,481,Comparison of Accounting and Financial Statement Effects of the Buy  versus Lease Decision
14,481,Bi ly Company is considering the following alternatives in obtaining the use of a new piece of equipment at the beginning of Year   
15,481,Alternative  
16,481,Buy the equipment and finance the purchase with new debt 
17,481,Alternative

19,481,Alternative  
20,481,Lease the equipment under a finance lease  the equipment is reported as an asset and an obligation is recorded equal to  the present value of future lease payments

22,481,   For each alternative under consideration determine the effect on assets and liabilities at the beginning of Year   
23,481,   For each alternative determine the effect on the income statement in Year   
24,481,   For each alternative calculate Bi ly s return on assets and debt to asset ratio at the end of Year    For simplicity assume  that excluding any effects of Bi ly s choice among the three alternatives for obtaining the assets total assets at the beginning and end  of the year are       total liabilities at the beginning and end of the year are       and net income for the year is

13,483,       Accounting and Reporting by the Lessee
14,483,A finance lease has traditionally been viewed as economically similar to borrowing money and buying an asset  therefore a company that enters into a  finance lease as the lessee reports an asset  leased asset  and related debt  lease payable  on the balance sheet  The initial value of both the leased asset  and the lease payable is the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of future lease payments  On the income statement the  company reports interest expense on the debt  and if the asset acquired is depreciable the company reports depreciation expense   The lessor as we  illustrate in Section       reports the sale of an asset and the lease as a receivable  
15,483,An operating lease has been viewed as economically similar to renting an asset so the lessee has recorded a lease expense on its income statement  during the period of use with no asset or liability recorded on its balance sheet  The main accounting differences between a finance lease and an  operating lease are that under a finance lease reported debt and assets are higher and expenses are generally higher in the early years  Because of the  higher reported assets debt and expenses and therefore the lower ROA all else equal lessees have often preferred operating leases to finance  leases  As we illustrate in the next section lessors  preferences generally differ  Lessors would prefer a finance lease because under an operating  lease lessors continue to show the asset and its associated financing on their balance sheets 
16,483,On the lessee s statement of cash flows for an operating lease the full lease payment is shown as an operating cash outflow  For a finance lease only  the portion of the lease payment relating to interest expense potentially reduces operating cash flows   the portion of the lease payment that reduces  the lease liability appears as a cash outflow in the financing section 
17,483,A company reporting a lease as an operating lease will typically show higher profits in early years higher return measures in early years and a  stronger solvency position than an identical company reporting an identical lease as a finance lease  However the company reporting the lease as a  finance lease will show higher operating cash flows because a portion of the lease payment will be reflected as a financing cash outflow rather than an  operating cash outflow 
18,483,The following example illustrates the effect on a lessee s income debt and cash flows when reporting a lease as a finance lease versus an operating  lease  Example    uses current US GAAP and the recognition of operating leases 
19,483,EXAMPLE   
20,483,Financial Statement Impact of a Finance versus Operating Lease for the  Lessee
21,483,Assume two similar  hypothetical  companies CAPBS Inc  and OPIS Inc  enter into similar lease agreements for a piece of machinery on    January Year    The leases require four annual payments of        starting on   January Year    The useful life of the machine is four years  and its salvage value is zero  CAPBS accounts for the lease as a finance lease and uses straight line depreciation while OPIS has determined  the lease is an operating lease  For simplicity this example assumes that the accounting rules governing these hypothetical companies do not  mandate either type of lease  The present value of lease payments and fair value of the equipment is           A reminder relevant for present  value calculations  Lease payments are made at the beginning of each period  
22,483,At the beginning of Year   before entering into the lease agreements both companies reported liabilities of         and equity of           Each year the companies receive total revenues of        and all revenues are cash  Assume the companies have a tax rate of    percent and  use the same accounting for financial and tax purposes  Both companies  discount rate is    percent  In order to focus only on the differences  in the type of lease assume neither company incurs expenses other than those associated with the lease and neither invests excess cash 
23,483,   Which company reports higher expenses net income in Year    Over the four years 
24,483,   Which company reports higher total cash flow over the four years  Cash flow from operations 
25,483,   Based on return on equity  ROE  how do the two companies  profitability measures compare 
26,483,   Based on the ratio of debt to equity how do the two companies  solvency positions compare 
27,483,Solution to   
28,483,In Year   and Year   CAPBS reports higher expenses because the depreciation expense and interest expense of its finance lease exceeds the  lease expense of OPIS s operating lease  Therefore OPIS reports higher net income in Year   and Year    The companies  total expense over  the entire four year period however is equal as is the companies  total net income 
29,483,Each year OPIS reports lease expense of        associated with its operating lease  For CAPBS its finance lease is treated as being  economically similar to borrowing money and purchasing an asset  So on its income statement CAPBS reports depreciation expense on the  leased asset acquired and interest expense on the lease liability

19,486,In summary a company reporting a lease as an operating lease will typically show higher profits in early years higher return measures in early years  and a stronger solvency position than an identical company reporting an identical lease as a finance lease    However the company reporting the lease  as a finance lease will show higher operating cash flows because a portion of the lease payment will be reflected as a financing cash outflow rather  than an operating cash outflow 
20,486,The precisely defined accounting standards in the United States that determine when a company should report a capital  finance  versus an operating  lease enable a company to structure a lease so as to avoid meeting any of the four capital lease criteria and thereby record an operating lease  Similar  to debt disclosures lease disclosures show payments under both capital and operating leases for the next five years and afterwards  Future payments  under US GAAP are disclosed year by year for the first five years and then aggregated for all subsequent years  Under IFRS future payments are  disclosed for the first year in aggregate for years two through five and then in aggregate for all subsequent years  These disclosures can help to  estimate the extent of a company s off balance sheet lease financing through operating leases  Example    illustrates the disclosures under current US  GAAP and how these disclosures can be used to determine the effect on the financial statements if all operating leases were capitalised as under IFRS

5,487,A  Calculate the implicit interest rate used to discount the  scheduled annual maturities  under capital leases to obtain the  present  value of future minimum lease payments  of        disclosed in the Commitments and Contingencies footnote  To simplify the  calculation assume that future minimum lease payments on the company s capital leases for the  thereafter  lump sum are as  follows        on    December of each year from      to      and      in       Assume annual lease payments are made at  the end of each year 
6,487,B  Why is the implicit interest rate estimate in Part A important in assessing a company s leases 
7,487,   If the operating lease agreements had been treated as capital leases what additional amount would be reported as a lease obligation on  the balance sheet at    December       To simplify the calculation assume that future minimum lease payments on the company s  operating leases for the  thereafter  lump sum are as follows         on    December each year from      to      and        in        Based on the implicit interest rate obtained in Part  A use        to discount future cash flows on the operating leases 
8,487,   What would be the effect on the debt to equity ratio of treating all operating leases as finance leases  i e  the ratio of total liabilities to  equity  at    December      
9,487,Solution to  A 
10,487,The implicit interest rate on finance leases is       percent  The implicit interest rate used to discount the finance lease payments is the internal  rate of return on the stream of cash flows  i e  the interest rate that will make the present value of the lease payments equal to         You  can use an Excel spreadsheet or a financial calculator for the computations  Set the cash flow at time zero equal to         note on Excel and  on most financial calculators you will input this amount as a negative number  input each of the annual payments on the finance leases and  solve for the internal rate of return 
11,487,To demonstrate how the internal rate of return corresponds to the individual present values refer to the following schedule of the undiscounted  minimum lease payments based on information from footnote   and the assumptions given  Exhibit    presents the present value  computations

22,487,The interest rate of       percent approximately equates the future minimum lease payments with the present value of future minimum lease  payments of        that CEC reports 
23,487,Solution to  B 
24,487,The implicit interest rate is important because it will be used to estimate the present value of the lease obligations reported as a liability the  value of the leased assets on the balance sheet the interest expense and the lease amortisation on the income statement  For instance by  selecting a higher rate a company could if desired opportunistically reduce the present value of its finance leases and thus its reported debt   The reasonableness of the implicit interest rate can be gauged by comparing it to the interest rates of the company s other debt instruments  outstanding which are disclosed in financial statement footnotes and by considering recent market conditions  Note however that the interest  rate implicit in capitalisation of the finance lease obligations reflects the interest rate at the time the lease occurred and thus may differ from  current rates

21,488,Lessors that report under US GAAP determine whether a lease is a finance  also called  capital lease   or operating lease using the same four criteria  as a lessee plus additional revenue recognition criteria  If a lessor enters into an operating lease the lessor records any lease revenue when earned   The lessor also continues to report the leased asset on the balance sheet and the asset s associated depreciation expense on the income statement 
22,488,Under a finance lease the lessor reports a lease receivable based on the present value of future lease payments and the lessor also reduces its assets by  the carrying amount of the asset leased  Under both US GAAP and IFRS the carrying amount of the asset leased relative to the present value of lease  payments distinguishes a direct financing lease from a sales type lease  The income statement will show interest revenue on the lease

5,489,   Based on ROE how do the two companies  profitability measures compare 
6,489,Solution to   
7,489,LOPER reports higher expenses in Year   because under an operating lease the lessor retains ownership of the asset and continues to report  associated depreciation expense  DIRFIN treating the lease as a finance lease does not reflect ownership of the asset or the associated  depreciation expense  DIRFIN has higher net income in Year   because the interest revenue component of the lease payment in that year  exceeds the lease revenue net of depreciation reported by LOPER

10,491,From the comparisons above DIRFIN looks more profitable in the early years of the lease but less profitable in the later years 
11,491,US GAAP make a further distinction in defining two types of non operating leases      direct financing leases and     sales type leases from the  lessor s perspective    A direct financing lease results when the present value of lease payments  and thus the amount recorded as a lease receivable   equals the carrying amount of the leased asset  Because there is no  profit  on the asset itself the lessor is essentially providing financing to the lessee  and the revenues earned by the lessor are financing in nature  i e  interest revenue   If however the present value of lease payments  and thus the  amount recorded as a lease receivable  exceeds the carrying value of the leased asset the lease is treated as a sale 
12,491,When a company enters into a sales type lease a lease agreement where the present value of lease payment is greater than the value of the leased asset  to the lessor it will show a profit on the transaction in the year of inception and interest revenue over the life of the lease 
13,491,EXAMPLE   
14,491,Financial Statement Impact of a Sales type Lease for the Lessor
15,491,Assume a  hypothetical  company Selnow Inc  owns a piece of machinery and enters into an agreement to lease the machinery on   January  Year    In the lease contract the company requires four annual payments of        starting on   January Year    The present value of the  lease payments  using a    percent discount rate  is         and the fair value of the equipment is         The useful life of the machinery  is four years and its salvage value is zero 
16,491,   Is the lease a direct financing or sales type lease 
17,491,   What is Selnow s income related to the lease in Year    In Year    Ignore taxes 
18,491,Solution to   
19,491,This is a sales type lease  The present value of lease payments is more than the lessor s carrying amount of the leased asset  The difference  between the present value of the lease payments and the carrying amount of the leased asset is the lessor s profit from selling the machinery   The lessor will record a profit of        on the sale of the leased equipment in Year            present value of lease payments receivable  less        value of leased equipment  
20,491,Solution to   
21,491,In Year   Selnow shows income of        related to the lease  One part of this is the        gain on the sale of the lease equipment  sales  revenues of         less costs of goods sold of          Selnow also shows interest revenue of       on its financing of the lease  lease  receivable of        after the initial lease payment is received times the    percent discount rate   In Year   Selnow reports only the interest  revenue of        lease receivable of        after the   January lease payment is received times the    percent discount rate   The table  below shows lease payments received interest revenue and reduction of the lease receivable for Selnow s sales type lease  Note that this table  is the same as DIRFIN s table in the previous example with the direct financing lease  They are the same because the present value of the lease  payments in both cases is the same  It is the fair value of the equipment that differs between the two examples

2,492,Understanding the reporting of long lived assets at inception requires distinguishing between expenditures that are capitalised  i e  reported as long  lived assets  and those that are expensed  Once a long lived asset is recognised it is reported under the cost model at its historical cost less  accumulated depreciation  amortisation  and less any impairment or under the revaluation model at its fair value  IFRS permit the use of either the  cost model or the revaluation model whereas US GAAP require the use of the cost model  Most companies reporting under IFRS use the cost model   The choice of different methods to depreciate  amortise  long lived assets can create challenges for analysts comparing companies 
3,492,Key points include the following 
4,492,  Expenditures related to long lived assets are capitalised as part of the cost of assets if they are expected to provide future benefits typically  beyond one year  Otherwise expenditures related to long lived assets are expensed as incurred 
5,492,  Although capitalising expenditures rather than expensing them results in higher reported profitability in the initial year it results in lower  profitability in subsequent years  however if a company continues to purchase similar or increasing amounts of assets each year the  profitability enhancing effect of capitalisation continues 
6,492,  Capitalising an expenditure rather than expensing it results in a greater amount reported as cash from operations because capitalised  expenditures are classified as an investing cash outflow rather than an operating cash outflow 
7,492,  Companies must capitalise interest costs associated with acquiring or constructing an asset that requires a long period of time to prepare for its  intended use 
8,492,  Including capitalised interest in the calculation of interest coverage ratios provides a better assessment of a company s solvency 
9,492,  IFRS require research costs be expensed but allow all development costs  not only software development costs  to be capitalised under certain  conditions  Generally US accounting standards require that research and development costs be expensed  however certain costs related to  software development are required to be capitalised 
10,492,  When one company acquires another company the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in which the  company identified as the acquirer allocates the purchase price to each asset acquired  and each liability assumed  on the basis of its fair value   Under acquisition accounting if the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the sum of the amounts that can be allocated to individual  identifiable assets and liabilities the excess is recorded as goodwill 
11,492,  The capitalised costs of long lived tangible assets and of intangible assets with finite useful lives are allocated to expense in subsequent periods  over their useful lives  For tangible assets this process is referred to as depreciation and for intangible assets it is referred to as amortisation 
12,492,  Long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or  circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
13,492,  Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually 
14,492,  Impairment disclosures can provide useful information about a company s expected cash flows 
15,492,  Methods of calculating depreciation or amortisation expense include the straight line method in which the cost of an asset is allocated to  expense in equal amounts each year over its useful life  accelerated methods in which the allocation of cost is greater in earlier years  and the  units of production method in which the allocation of cost corresponds to the actual use of an asset in a particular period 
16,492,  Estimates required for depreciation and amortisation calculations include the useful life of the equipment  or its total lifetime productive  capacity  and its expected residual value at the end of that useful life  A longer useful life and higher expected residual value result in a smaller  amount of annual depreciation relative to a shorter useful life and lower expected residual value 
17,492,  IFRS permit the use of either the cost model or the revaluation model for the valuation and reporting of long lived assets but the revaluation  model is not allowed under US GAAP 
18,492,  Under the revaluation model carrying amounts are the fair values at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation or  amortisation 
19,492,  In contrast with depreciation and amortisation charges which serve to allocate the cost of a long lived asset over its useful life impairment  charges reflect an unexpected decline in the fair value of an asset to an amount lower than its carrying amount 
20,492,  IFRS permit impairment losses to be reversed with the reversal reported in profit  US GAAP do not permit the reversal of impairment losses 
21,492,  The gain or loss on the sale of long lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the time of sale 
22,492,  Estimates of average age and remaining useful life of a company s assets reflect the relationship between assets accounted for on a historical  cost basis and depreciation amounts 
23,492,  The average remaining useful life of a company s assets can be estimated as net PPE divided by depreciation expense although the accounting  useful life may not necessarily correspond to the economic useful life 
24,492,  Long lived assets reclassified as held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortised  Long lived assets to be disposed of other than by a sale  e g   by abandonment exchange for another asset or distribution to owners in a spin off  are classified as held for use until disposal  Thus they  continue to be depreciated and tested for impairment 
25,492,  Investment property is defined as property that is owned  or in some cases leased under a finance lease  for the purpose of earning rentals  capital appreciation or both 
26,492,  Under IFRS companies are allowed to value investment properties using either a cost model or a fair value model  The cost model is identical  to the cost model used for property plant and equipment but the fair value model differs from the revaluation model used for property plant  and equipment  Under the fair value model all changes in the fair value of investment property affect net income 
27,492,  Under US GAAP investment properties are generally measured using the cost model

2,493,  Accounting standards have traditionally defined two types of leases  operating leases and finance  or capital  leases  US GAAP specify four  criteria to determine when a lease is classified as a capital lease although proposed standards would eliminate those specific criteria  IFRS have  been less prescriptive in determining the classification of a lease as a finance lease  The new IFRS    requires that both operating leases and  financing leases are recognized and accounted for as finance leases by the lessee 
3,493,  When a lessee reports a lease as an operating lease rather than a finance lease it usually appears more profitable in early years of the lease and  less so later and it appears less leveraged over the entire lease period 
4,493,  When a lessor reports a lease as a finance lease rather than an operating lease it usually appears more profitable in early years of the lease

11,500,B  higher fixed asset turnover 
12,500,C  higher total liabilities to total assets ratio 
13,500,The following information relates to Questions      
14,500,Brian Jordan is interviewing for a junior equity analyst position at Orion Investment Advisors  As part of the interview process Mary Benn Orion s  Director of Research provides Jordan with information about two hypothetical companies Alpha and Beta and asks him to comment on the  information on their financial statements and ratios  Both companies prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards  IFRS  and are identical in all respects except for their accounting choices 
15,500,Jordan is told that at the beginning of the current fiscal year both companies purchased a major new computer system and began building new  manufacturing plants for their own use  Alpha capitalised and Beta expensed the cost of the computer system  Alpha capitalised and Beta expensed the  interest costs associated with the construction of the manufacturing plants  In mid year both companies leased new office headquarters  Alpha  classified the lease as an operating lease and Beta classified it as a finance lease 
16,500,Benn asks Jordan  What was the impact of these decisions on each company s current fiscal year financial statements and ratios  
17,500,Jordan responds  Alpha s decision to capitalise the cost of its new computer system instead of expensing it results in lower net income lower total  assets and higher cash flow from operating activities in the current fiscal year  Alpha s decision to capitalise its interest costs instead of expensing  them results in a lower fixed asset turnover ratio and a higher interest coverage ratio  Alpha s decision to classify its lease as an operating lease instead  of a finance lease results in higher net income higher cash flow from operating activities and stronger solvency and activity ratios compared to Beta  
18,500,Jordan is told that Alpha uses the straight line depreciation method and Beta uses an accelerated depreciation method  both companies estimate the  same useful lives for long lived assets  Many companies in their industry use the units of production method 
19,500,Benn asks Jordan  What are the financial statement implications of each depreciation method and how do you determine a company s need to  reinvest in its productive capacity  
20,500,Jordan replies  All other things being equal the straight line depreciation method results in the least variability of net profit margin over time while  an accelerated depreciation method results in a declining trend in net profit margin over time  The units of production can result in a net profit margin  trend that is quite variable  I use a three step approach to estimate a company s need to reinvest in its productive capacity  First I estimate the average  age of the assets by dividing net property plant and equipment by annual depreciation expense  Second I estimate the average remaining useful life  of the assets by dividing accumulated depreciation by depreciation expense  Third I add the estimates of the average remaining useful life and the  average age of the assets in order to determine the total useful life  
21,500,Jordan is told that at the end of the current fiscal year Alpha revalued a manufacturing plant  this increased its reported carrying amount by     percent  There was no previous downward revaluation of the plant  Beta recorded an impairment loss on a manufacturing plant  this reduced its  carrying by    percent 
22,500,Benn asks Jordan  What was the impact of these decisions on each company s current fiscal year financial ratios  
23,500,Jordan responds  Beta s impairment loss increases its debt to total assets and fixed asset turnover ratios and lowers its cash flow from operating  activities  Alpha s revaluation increases its debt to capital and return on assets ratios and reduces its return on equity  
24,500,At the end of the interview Benn thanks Jordan for his time and states that a hiring decision will be made shortly 
25,500,    Jordan s response about the financial statement impact of Alpha s decision to capitalise the cost of its new computer system is most likely  correct with respect to 
26,500,A  lower net income 
27,500,B  lower total assets 
28,500,C  higher cash flow from operating activities 
29,500,    Jordan s response about the ratio impact of Alpha s decision to capitalise interest costs is most likely correct with respect to the

24,501,   B is correct  Only costs necessary for the machine to be ready to use can be capitalized  Therefore Total capitalized costs                                      
25,501,   C is correct  When property and equipment are purchased the assets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost  Costs for the assets include all  expenditures required to prepare the assets for their intended use  Any other costs are expensed  Costs to train staff for using the machine are not  required to prepare the property and equipment for their intended use and these costs are expensed 
26,501,   B is correct  When a company constructs an asset borrowing costs incurred directly related to the construction are generally capitalized  If the  asset is constructed for sale the borrowing costs are classified as inventory 
27,501,   A is correct  Borrowing costs can be capitalized under IFRS until the tangible asset is ready for use  Also under IFRS income earned on  temporarily investing the borrowed monies decreases the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalization  Therefore Total capitalized  interest        million           years       million       million 
28,501,   B is correct  A product patent with a defined expiration date is an intangible asset with a finite useful life  A copyright with no expiration date is  an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  Goodwill is no longer considered an intangible asset under IFRS and is considered to have an  indefinite useful life 
29,501,   C is correct  An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized whereas an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not 
30,501,   A is correct  The costs to internally develop intangible assets are generally expensed when incurred 
31,501,   C is correct  Under both International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  and US GAAP if an item is acquired in a business combination and  cannot be recognized as a tangible asset or identifiable intangible asset it is recognized as goodwill  Under US GAAP assets arising from  contractual or legal rights and assets that can be separated from the acquired company are recognized separately from goodwill 
32,501,   A is correct  In the fiscal year when long lived equipment is purchased the assets on the balance sheet increase and depreciation expense on the  income statement increases because of the new long lived asset 
33,501,    B is correct  Company Z s return on equity based on year end equity value will be       Company Z will have an additional         of  expenses compared with Company X  Company Z expensed the printer for         rather than capitalizing the printer and having a  depreciation expense of         like Company X  Company Z s net income and shareholders  equity will be         lower                     than that of Company X

5,502,    A is correct  If the company uses the straight line method the depreciation expense will be one fifth     percent  of the depreciable cost in Year     If it uses the units of production method the depreciation expense will be    percent              of the depreciable cost in Year     Therefore if the company uses the straight line method its depreciation expense will be higher and its net income will be lower 
6,502,    C is correct  The operating income or earnings before interest and taxes will be lowest for the method that results in the highest depreciation  expense  The double declining balance method results in the highest depreciation expense in the first year of use

11,502,    C is correct  If Martinez wants to minimize tax payments in the first year of the machine s life he should use an accelerated method such as the  double declining balance method 
12,502,    A is correct  Using the straight line method depreciation expense amounts to
13,502,Depreciation expense                        years          
14,502,    B is correct  Using the units of production method depreciation expense amounts to
15,502,Depreciation expense                                                 
16,502,    A is correct  The straight line method is the method that evenly distributes the cost of an asset over its useful life because amortization is the  same amount every year 
17,502,    A is correct  A higher residual value results in a lower total depreciable cost and therefore a lower amount of amortization in the first year after  acquisition  and every year after that  
18,502,    C is correct  Shifting at the end of Year   from double declining balance to straight line depreciation methodology results in depreciation  expense being the same in each of Years     and    Shifting to the straight line methodology at the beginning of Year   results in a greater  depreciation expense in Year   than would have been calculated using the double declining balance method

34,502,Depreciation expense                                    
35,502,    B is correct  As shown in the following calculations under the double declining balance method the annual amortization expense in Year   is  closest to      million 
36,502,Annual amortization expense       Straight line amortization rate   Net book value 
37,502,Amortization expense Year                   million        million 
38,502,    A is correct  As shown in the following calculations at the end of Year   the difference between the net book values calculated using straight  line versus double declining balance is closest to        
39,502,Net book value end of Year   using straight line method                                         
40,502,Net book value end of Year   using double declining balance method                                   
41,502,    B is correct  In this case the value increase brought about by the revaluation should be recorded directly in equity  The reason is that under  IFRS an increase in value brought about by a revaluation can only be recognized as a profit to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease  of the same asset previously recognized in the income statement 
42,502,    B is correct  The impairment loss equals

4,503,           
5,503,    B is correct  Under IFRS an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s recoverable amount  The  recoverable amount is the higher of the asset s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use  Value in use is a discounted measure of expected  future cash flows  Under US GAAP assessing recoverability is separate from measuring the impairment loss  If the asset s carrying amount  exceeds its undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset s carrying amount is considered unrecoverable and the impairment loss is  measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value 
6,503,    B is correct  The result on the sale of the vehicle equals

8,503,  Sale proceeds    Acquisition cost   Accumulated depreciation

11,503,    A is correct  Gain or loss on the sale   Sale proceeds   Carrying amount  Rearranging this equation Sale proceeds   Carrying amount   Gain or  loss on sale  Thus Sale price       million     million          million        million 
12,503,    C is correct  The carrying amount of the asset on the balance sheet is reduced by the amount of the impairment loss and the impairment loss is  reported on the income statement 
13,503,    A is correct  The gain or loss on the sale of long lived assets is computed as the sales proceeds minus the carrying amount of the asset at the  time of sale  This is true under the cost and revaluation models of reporting long lived assets  In the absence of impairment losses under the  cost model the carrying amount will equal historical cost net of accumulated depreciation 
14,503,    B is correct  IFRS do not require acquisition dates to be disclosed 
15,503,    A is correct  IFRS do not require fair value of intangible assets to be disclosed 
16,503,    C is correct  Under US GAAP companies are required to disclose the estimated amortization expense for the next five fiscal years  Under US  GAAP there is no reversal of impairment losses  Disclosure of the useful lives finite or indefinite and additional related details is required  under IFRS 
17,503,    B is correct  Investment property earns rent  Investment property and property plant and equipment are tangible and long lived 
18,503,    C is correct  When a company uses the fair value model to value investment property changes in the fair value of the property are reported in  the income statement not in other comprehensive income 
19,503,    A is correct  Investment property earns rent  Inventory is held for resale and property plant and equipment are used in the production of goods  and services 
20,503,    C is correct  A company will change from the fair value model to either the cost model or revaluation model when the company transfers  investment property to property plant and equipment 
21,503,    A is correct  Under both the revaluation model for property plant and equipment and the fair model for investment property the asset s fair  value must be able to be measured reliably  Under the fair value model net income is affected by all changes in the asset s fair value  Under the  revaluation model any increase in an asset s value to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrease will be recognized on the  income statement and increase net income 
22,503,    A is correct  Under IFRS when using the cost model for its investment properties a company must disclose useful lives  The method for  determining fair value as well as reconciliation between beginning and ending carrying amounts of investment property is a required disclosure  when the fair value model is used 
23,503,    C is correct  A lease can reduce the risks of obsolescence to the lessee because the lessee does not own the asset  Under a finance lease a leased  asset and a lease obligation are reported on the balance sheet and depreciation expense and interest expense are reported on the income  statement 
24,503,    C is correct  Expensing rather than capitalising an investment in long term assets will result in higher expenses and lower net income and net  profit margin in the current year  Future years  incomes will not include depreciation expense related to these expenditures  Consequently year  to year growth in profitability will be higher  If the expenses had been capitalised the carrying amount of the assets would have been higher and  the      total asset turnover would have been lower 
25,503,    C is correct  In      switching to an accelerated depreciation method would increase depreciation expense and decrease income before taxes  taxes payable and net income  Cash flow from operating activities would increase because of the resulting tax savings 
26,503,    B is correct       net income and net profit margin are lower because of the impairment loss  Consequently net profit margins in subsequent  years are likely to be higher  An impairment loss suggests that insufficient depreciation expense was recognized in prior years and net income  was overstated in prior years  The impairment loss is a non cash item and will not affect operating cash flows 
27,503,    A is correct  The estimated average remaining useful life is       years

2,504,                      
3,504,    A is correct  When leases are classified as finance leases the lessee initially reports an asset and liability at a carrying amount equal to the lower  of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the future lease payments  Under an operating lease the lessee does not report an  asset or liability  Therefore total asset turnover  total revenue   average total assets  would be lower if the leases were classified as finance  leases 
4,504,    C is correct  Total liabilities to assets would be higher  When leases are classified as finance leases the lessee initially reports an asset and  liability at a carrying amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the future lease payments  Both the  numerator and denominator would increase by an equal amount but the proportional increase in the numerator is higher and the ratio would be  higher  The following exhibit shows what would happen to      total liabilities assets and total liabilities to assets if      million the fair  value of the leased equipment is added to AMRC s total liabilities and assets  This simple example ignores the impact of accounting for the       lease payment

7,504,     Hypothetical Under Finance Lease                  
8,504,The depreciation and interest expense under a finance lease tends to be higher than the operating lease payment in the early years of the lease   The finance lease would result in lower net income and net profit margin  Long lived  fixed  assets are higher under a finance lease and fixed  asset turnover is lower 
9,504,    C is correct  The decision to capitalise the costs of the new computer system results in higher cash flow from operating activities  the  expenditure is reported as an outflow of investing activities  The company allocates the capitalised amount over the asset s useful life as  depreciation or amortisation expense rather than expensing it in the year of expenditure  Net income and total assets are higher in the current  fiscal year 
10,504,    B is correct  Alpha s fixed asset turnover will be lower because the capitalised interest will appear on the balance sheet as part of the asset being  constructed  Therefore fixed assets will be higher and the fixed asset turnover ratio  total revenue average net fixed assets  will be lower than if  it had expensed these costs  Capitalised interest appears on the balance sheet as part of the asset being constructed instead of being reported as  interest expense in the period incurred  However the interest coverage ratio should be based on interest payments not interest expense  earnings  before interest and taxes interest payments  and should be unchanged  To provide a true picture of a company s interest coverage the entire  amount of interest expenditure both the capitalised portion and the expensed portion should be used in calculating interest coverage ratios 
11,504,    C is correct  The cash flow from operating activities will be lower not higher because the full lease payment is treated as an operating cash  outflow  With a finance lease only the portion of the lease payment relating to interest expense potentially reduces operating cash outflows  A  company reporting a lease as an operating lease will typically show higher profits in early years because the lease expense is less than the sum  of the interest and depreciation expense  The company reporting the lease as an operating lease will typically report stronger solvency and  activity ratios 
12,504,    A is correct  Accelerated depreciation will result in an improving not declining net profit margin over time because the amount of depreciation  expense declines each year  Under straight line depreciation the amount of depreciation expense will remain the same each year  Under the  units of production method the amount of depreciation expense reported each year varies with the number of units produced 
13,504,    B is correct  The estimated average total useful life of a company s assets is calculated by adding the estimates of the average remaining useful  life and the average age of the assets  The average age of the assets is estimated by dividing accumulated depreciation by depreciation expense   The average remaining useful life of the asset base is estimated by dividing net property plant and equipment by annual depreciation expense 
14,504,    C is correct  The impairment loss is a non cash charge and will not affect cash flow from operating activities  The debt to total assets and fixed  asset turnover ratios will increase because the impairment loss will reduce the carrying amount of fixed assets and therefore total assets 
15,504,    A is correct  In an asset revaluation the carrying amount of the assets increases  The increase in the asset s carrying amount bypasses the  income statement and is reported as other comprehensive income and appears in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus  Therefore  shareholders  equity will increase but net income will not be affected so return on equity will decline  Return on assets and debt to capital ratios  will also decrease

4,507,   INTRODUCTION
5,507,For those companies reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  IAS      Income Taxes  covers accounting for a company s income taxes and the reporting of  deferred taxes  For those companies reporting under United States generally accepted  accounting principles  US GAAP  FASB ASC Topic      Income Taxes  is the primary source  for information on accounting for income taxes  Although IFRS and US GAAP follow similar  conventions on many income tax issues there are some key differences that will be discussed in  the reading 
6,507,Differences between how and when transactions are recognized for financial reporting purposes  relative to tax reporting can give rise to differences in tax expense and related tax assets and  liabilities  To reconcile these differences companies that report under either IFRS or US GAAP  create a provision on the balance sheet called deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities  depending on the nature of the situation 
7,507,Deferred tax assets or liabilities usually arise when accounting standards and tax authorities  recognize the timing of revenues and expenses at different times  Because timing differences  such as these will eventually reverse over time they are called  temporary differences    Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been recognized for tax reporting purposes  or  often the carrying forward of losses from previous periods  but have not yet been recognized on  the income statement prepared for financial reporting purposes  Deferred tax liabilities represent  tax expense that has appeared on the income statement for financial reporting purposes but has  not yet become payable under tax regulations 
8,507,This reading provides a primer on the basics of income tax accounting and reporting  The  reading is organized as follows  Section   describes the differences between taxable income and  accounting profit  Section   explains the determination of tax base which relates to the  valuation of assets and liabilities for tax purposes  Section   discusses several types of timing  differences between the recognition of taxable and accounting profit  Section   examines  unused tax losses and tax credits  Section   describes the recognition and measurement of  current and deferred tax  Section   discusses the disclosure and presentation of income tax  information on companies  financial statements and illustrates its practical implications for  financial analysis  Section   provides an overview of the similarities and differences for  income tax reporting between IFRS and US GAAP  A summary of the key points and practice  problems in the CFA Institute multiple choice format conclude the reading

2,508,   DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACCOUNTING  PROFIT AND TAXABLE INCOME
3,508,A company s accounting profit is reported on its income statement in accordance with  prevailing accounting standards  Accounting profit  also referred to as income before taxes or  pretax income  does not include a provision for income tax expense   A company s taxable  income is the portion of its income that is subject to income taxes under the tax laws of its  jurisdiction  Because of different guidelines for how income is reported on a company s  financial statements and how it is measured for income tax purposes accounting profit and  taxable income may differ 
4,508,A company s taxable income is the basis for its income tax payable  a liability  or  recoverable  an asset  which is calculated on the basis of the company s tax rate and appears on  its balance sheet  A company s tax expense or tax benefit in the case of a recovery appears  on its income statement and is an aggregate of its income tax payable  or recoverable in the case  of a tax benefit  and any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
5,508,When a company s taxable income is greater than its accounting profit then its income taxes  payable will be higher than what would have otherwise been the case had the income taxes been  determined based on accounting profit  Deferred tax assets which appear on the balance  sheet arise when an excess amount is paid for income taxes  taxable income higher than  accounting profit  and the company expects to recover the difference during the course of future  operations  Actual income taxes payable will thus exceed the financial accounting income tax  expense  which is reported on the income statement and is determined based on accounting  profit   Related to deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance which is a reserve created  against deferred tax assets  The valuation allowance is based on the likelihood of realizing the  deferred tax assets in future accounting periods  Deferred tax liabilities which also appear on  the balance sheet arise when a deficit amount is paid for income taxes and the company expects  to eliminate the deficit over the course of future operations  In this case financial accounting  income tax expense exceeds income taxes payable 
6,508,Income tax paid in a period is the actual amount paid for income taxes  not a provision but  the actual cash outflow   The income tax paid may be less than the income tax expense because  of payments in prior periods or refunds received in the current period  Income tax paid reduces  the income tax payable which is carried on the balance sheet as a liability 
7,508,The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount at which the asset or liability is valued for  tax purposes whereas the carrying amount is the amount at which the asset or liability is  valued according to accounting principles   Differences between the tax base and the carrying  amount also result in differences between accounting profit and taxable income  These  differences can carry through to future periods  For example a tax loss carry forward occurs  when a company experiences a loss in the current period that may be used to reduce future  taxable income  The company s tax expense on its income statement must not only reflect the  taxes payable based on taxable income but also the effect of these differences

2,509,     Current Tax Assets and Liabilities
3,509,A company s current tax liability is the amount payable in taxes and is based on current taxable  income  If the company expects to receive a refund for some portion previously paid in taxes  the amount recoverable is referred to as a current tax asset  The current tax liability or asset  may however differ from what the liability would have been if it was based on accounting  profit rather than taxable income for the period  Differences in accounting profit and taxable  income are the result of the application of different rules  Such differences between accounting  profit and taxable income can occur in several ways including 
4,509,  Revenues and expenses may be recognized in one period for accounting purposes and a  different period for tax purposes 
5,509,  Specific revenues and expenses may be either recognized for accounting purposes and not  for tax purposes  or not recognized for accounting purposes but recognized for tax  purposes 
6,509,  The carrying amount and tax base of assets and or liabilities may differ 
7,509,  The deductibility of gains and losses of assets and liabilities may vary for accounting and  income tax purposes 
8,509,  Subject to tax rules tax losses of prior years might be used to reduce taxable income in  later years resulting in differences in accounting and taxable income  tax loss  carryforward   and
9,509,  Adjustments of reported financial data from prior years might not be recognized equally  for accounting and tax purposes or might be recognized in different periods 
10,509,     Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
11,509,Deferred tax assets represent taxes that have been paid  or often the carrying forward of losses  from previous periods  but have not yet been recognized on the income statement  Deferred tax  liabilities occur when financial accounting income tax expense is greater than regulatory  income tax expense  Deferred tax assets and liabilities usually arise when accounting standards  and tax authorities recognize the timing of taxes due at different times  for example when a  company uses accelerated depreciation when reporting to the tax authority  to increase expense  and lower tax payments in the early years  but uses the straight line method on the financial  statements  Although not similar in treatment on a year to year basis  e g  depreciation of    percent on a straight line basis may be permitted for accounting purposes whereas    percent is  allowed for tax purposes  over the life of the asset both approaches allow for the total cost of  the asset to be depreciated  or amortized   Because these timing differences will eventually  reverse or self correct over the course of the asset s depreciable life they are called  temporary  differences  
12,509,Under IFRS deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as noncurrent  Under US  GAAP however deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified on the balance sheet as current  and noncurrent based on the classification of the underlying asset or liability

2,510,Any deferred tax asset or liability is based on temporary differences that result in an excess or a  deficit amount paid for taxes which the company expects to recover from future operations   Because taxes will be recoverable or payable at a future date it is only a temporary difference  and a deferred tax asset or liability is created  Changes in the deferred tax asset or liability on  the balance sheet reflect the difference between the amounts recognized in the previous period  and the current period  The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are added to income tax  payable to determine the company s income tax expense  or credit  as it is reported on the  income statement 
3,510,At the end of each fiscal year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recalculated by comparing  the tax bases and carrying amounts of the balance sheet items  Identified temporary differences  should be assessed on whether the difference will result in future economic benefits  For  example Pinto Construction  a hypothetical company  depreciates equipment on a straight line  basis of    percent per year  The tax authorities allow depreciation of    percent per year  At  the end of the fiscal year the carrying amount of the equipment for accounting purposes would  be greater than the tax base of the equipment thus resulting in a temporary difference  A  deferred tax item may only be created if it is not doubtful that the company will realize  economic benefits in the future  In our example the equipment is used in the core business of  Pinto Construction  If the company is a going concern and stable there should be no doubt that  future economic benefits will result from the equipment and it would be appropriate to create  the deferred tax item 
4,510,Should it be doubtful that future economic benefits will be realized from a temporary difference   such as Pinto Construction being under liquidation  the temporary difference will not lead to  the creation of a deferred tax asset or liability  If a deferred tax asset or liability resulted in the  past but the criteria of economic benefits is not met on the current balance sheet date then  under IFRS an existing deferred tax asset or liability related to the item will be reversed  Under  US GAAP a valuation allowance is established  In assessing future economic benefits much is  left to the discretion of the auditor in assessing the temporary differences and the issue of future  economic benefits

2,511,The financial performance and accounting profit of Reston Partners on this income  statement is based on accounting principles appropriate for the jurisdiction in which  Reston Partners operates  The principles used to calculate accounting profit  profit  before tax in the example above  may differ from the principles applied for tax purposes   the calculation of taxable income   For illustrative purposes however assume that all  income and expenses on the income statement are treated identically for tax and  accounting purposes except depreciation 
3,511,The depreciation is related to equipment owned by Reston Partners  For simplicity  assume that the equipment was purchased at the beginning of the      fiscal year   Depreciation should thus be calculated and expensed for the full year  Assume that  accounting standards permit equipment to be depreciated on a straight line basis over a     year period whereas the tax standards in the jurisdiction specify that equipment  should be depreciated on a straight line basis over a   year period  For simplicity  assume a salvage value of    at the end of the equipment s useful life  Both methods  will result in the full depreciation of the asset over the respective tax or accounting life 
4,511,The equipment was originally purchased for         In accordance with accounting  standards over the next    years the company will recognize annual depreciation of                      as an expense on its income statement and for the determination  of accounting profit  For tax purposes however the company will recognize                     in depreciation each year  Each fiscal year the depreciation expense  related to the use of the equipment will therefore differ for tax and accounting purposes   tax base vs  carrying amount  resulting in a difference between accounting profit and  taxable income

2,512,At each balance sheet date the tax base and carrying amount of all assets and liabilities  must be determined  The income tax payable by Reston Partners will be based on the  taxable income of each fiscal year  If a tax rate of    percent is assumed then the  income taxes payable for           and      are                                         and                     
3,512,Remember though that if the tax obligation is calculated based on accounting profits it  will differ because of the differences between the tax base and the carrying amount of  equipment  The difference in each fiscal year is reflected in the table above  In each  fiscal year the carrying amount of the equipment exceeds its tax base  For tax purposes  therefore the asset tax base is less than its carrying value under financial accounting  principles  The difference results in a deferred tax liability 
4,512,   Millions                 Deferred tax liability                    Difference between tax base and carrying amount    tax rate                                                                                                                  
5,512,The comparison of the tax base and carrying amount of equipment shows what the  deferred tax liability should be on a particular balance sheet date  In each fiscal year  only the change in the deferred tax liability should be included in the calculation of the  income tax expense reported on the income statement prepared for accounting purposes 
6,512,On the income statement the company s income tax expense will be the sum of change  in the deferred tax liability and the income tax payable

5,513,   DETERMINING THE TAX BASE OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES
6,513,As mentioned in Section   temporary differences arise from a difference in the tax base and  carrying amount of assets and liabilities  The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount  attributed to the asset or liability for tax purposes whereas the carrying amount is based on  accounting principles  Such a difference is considered temporary if it is expected that the taxes  will be recovered or payable at a future date 
7,513,     Determining the Tax Base of an Asset
8,513,The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in future periods  as the economic benefits become realized and the company recovers the carrying amount of the  asset 
9,513,For example our previously mentioned Reston Partners  from Example    depreciates  equipment on a straight line basis at a rate of    percent per year  The tax authorities allow  depreciation of approximately    percent per year  At the end of the fiscal year the carrying  amount of equipment for accounting purposes is greater than the asset tax base thus resulting in  a temporary difference

14,514,   Development costs  First we assume that development costs will generate  economic benefits for Entiguan Sports  Therefore it may be included as an asset  on the balance sheet for the purposes of this example  Second the amortization  allowed by the tax authorities exceeds the amortization accounted for based on  accounting rules  Therefore the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its tax base   The carrying amount is                                 whereas the tax  base is

2,515,   Research costs  We assume that research costs will result in future economic  benefits for the company  If this were not the case creation of a deferred tax asset  or liability would not be allowed  The tax base of research costs exceeds their  carrying amount  The carrying amount is    because the full amount has been  expensed for financial reporting purposes in the year in which it was incurred   Therefore there would not have been a balance sheet item  Research costs  for  tax purposes and only a proportion may be deducted in the current fiscal year   The tax base of the asset is                                 
3,515,   Accounts receivable  The economic benefits that should have been received from  accounts receivable have already been included in revenues included in the  calculation of the taxable income when the sales occurred  Because the receipt of  a portion of the accounts receivable is doubtful the provision is allowed  The  provision based on tax legislation results in a greater amount allowed in the  current fiscal year than would be the case under accounting principles  This  results in the tax base of accounts receivable being lower than its carrying amount   Note that the example specifically states that the balance sheet amount for  accounts receivable after the provision for accounting purposes amounts to            Therefore accounts receivable before any provision was                                 The tax base is calculated as                                                                 
4,515,     Determining the Tax Base of a Liability
5,515,The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will be  deductible for tax purposes in the future  With respect to payments from customers received in  advance of providing the goods and services the tax base of such a liability is the carrying  amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in future  Keep in mind the  following fundamental principle  In general a company will recognize a deferred tax asset or  liability when recovery settlement of the carrying amount will affect future tax payments by  either increasing or reducing the taxable profit  Remember an analyst is not only evaluating the  difference between the carrying amount and the tax base but the relevance of that difference on  future profits and losses and thus by implication future taxes 
6,515,IFRS offers specific guidelines with regard to revenue received in advance  IAS    states that  the tax base is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxed at a  future date  Under US GAAP an analysis of the tax base would result in a similar outcome  The  tax legislation within the jurisdiction will determine the amount recognized on the income  statement and whether the liability  revenue received in advance  will have a tax base greater  than zero  This will depend on how tax legislation recognizes revenue received in advance

2,516,Determining the Tax Base of a Liability
3,516,The following information pertains to Entiguan Sports for the      year end  The  treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes is based on fictitious accounting and  tax standards and is not specific to a particular jurisdiction  Calculate the tax base and  carrying amount for each item 
4,516,   Donations  Entiguan Sports made donations of         in the current fiscal year   The donations were expensed for financial reporting purposes but are not tax  deductible based on applicable tax legislation 
5,516,   Interest received in advance  Entiguan Sports received in advance interest of           The interest is taxed because tax authorities recognize the interest to  accrue to the company  part of taxable income  on the date of receipt 
6,516,   Rent received in advance  Entiguan recognized     million for rent received in  advance from a lessee for an unused warehouse building  Rent received in  advance is deferred for accounting purposes but taxed on a cash basis 
7,516,   Loan  Entiguan Sports secured a long term loan for         in the current fiscal  year  Interest is charged at      percent per annum and is payable at the end of  each fiscal year

14,516,   Donations  The amount of         was immediately expensed on Entiguan s  income statement  therefore the carrying amount is     Tax legislation does not  allow donations to be deducted for tax purposes so the tax base of the donations  equals the carrying amount  Note that while the carrying amount and tax base are  the same the difference in the treatment of donations for accounting and tax  purposes  expensed for accounting purposes but not deductible for tax purposes   represents a permanent difference  a difference that will not be reversed in future    Permanent and temporary differences are elaborated on in Section   and it will  refer to this particular case with an expanded explanation

2,517,   Interest received in advance  Based on the information provided for tax purposes  interest is deemed to accrue to the company on the date of receipt  For tax  purposes it is thus irrelevant whether it is for the current or a future accounting  period  it must be included in taxable income in the financial year received   Interest received in advance is for accounting purposes though included in the  financial period in which it is deemed to have been earned  For this reason the  interest income received in advance is a balance sheet liability  It was not included  on the income statement because the income relates to a future financial year   Because the full         is included in taxable income in the current fiscal year  the tax base is                        Note that although interest received in  advance and rent received in advance are both taxed the timing depends on how  the particular item is treated in tax legislation 
3,517,   Rent received in advance  The result is similar to interest received in advance  The  carrying amount of rent received in advance would be           while the tax  base is    
4,517,   Loan  Repayment of the loan has no tax implications  The repayment of the  capital amount does not constitute an income or expense  The interest paid is  included as an expense in the calculation of taxable income as well as accounting  income  Therefore the tax base and carrying amount is     For clarity the interest  paid that would be included on the income statement for the year amounts to                           if the loan was acquired at the beginning of the  current fiscal year 
5,517,     Changes in Income Tax Rates
6,517,The measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on current tax law  But if there  are subsequent changes in tax laws or new income tax rates existing deferred tax assets and  liabilities must be adjusted for the effects of these changes  The resulting effects of the changes  are also included in determining accounting profit in the period of change 
7,517,When income tax rates change the deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to the new tax  rate  If income tax rates increase deferred taxes  that is the deferred tax assets and liabilities   will also increase  Likewise if income tax rates decrease deferred taxes will decrease  A  decrease in tax rates decreases deferred tax liabilities which reduces future tax payments to the  taxing authorities  A decrease in tax rates will also decrease deferred tax assets which reduces  their value toward the offset of future tax payments to the taxing authorities 
8,517,To illustrate the effect of a change in tax rate consider Example   again  In that illustration the  timing difference that led to the recognition of a deferred tax liability for Reston Partners was  attributable to differences in the method of depreciation and the related effects on the  accounting carrying value and the asset tax base  The relevant information is restated below 
9,517,The carrying amount and tax base for the equipment is

8,518,At a    percent income tax rate the deferred tax liability was then determined as follows 
9,518,   Millions  Deferred tax liability     Difference between tax base and carrying amount                                                                                                                      
10,518,                   
11,518,         
12,518,For this illustration assume that the taxing authority has changed the income tax rate to     percent for       Although the difference between the carrying amount and the tax base of the  depreciable asset are the same the deferred tax liability for      will be       instead of       or a reduction of      in the liability                                       
13,518,Reston Partners  provision for income tax expense is also affected by the change in tax rates   Taxable income for      will now be taxed at a rate of    percent  The benefit of the       accelerated depreciation tax shield is now only                   instead of the previous        a reduction of       In addition the reduction in the beginning carrying value of the deferred  tax liability for       the year of change  further reduces the income tax expense for       The  reduction in income tax expense attributable to the change in tax rate is                                        Note that these two components together account for the reduction in the  deferred tax liability                    
14,518,As may be seen from this discussion changes in the income tax rate have an effect on a  company s deferred tax asset and liability carrying values as well as an effect on the  measurement of income tax expense in the year of change  The analyst must thus note that  proposed changes in tax law can have a quantifiable effect on these accounts  and any related  financial ratios that are derived from them  if the proposed changes are subsequently enacted  into law

2,519,   TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TAXABLE AND  ACCOUNTING PROFIT
3,519,Temporary differences arise from a difference between the tax base and the carrying amount of  assets and liabilities  The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability from a temporary difference  is only possible if the difference reverses itself at some future date and to such an extent that the  balance sheet item is expected to create future economic benefits for the company  IFRS and  US GAAP both prescribe the balance sheet liability method for recognition of deferred tax  This  balance sheet method focuses on the recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability should there  be a temporary difference between the carrying amount and tax base of balance sheet items  
4,519,Permanent differences are differences between tax and financial reporting of revenue   expenses  that will not be reversed at some future date  Because they will not be reversed at a  future date these differences do not give rise to deferred tax  These items typically include
5,519,  Income or expense items not allowed by tax legislation and
6,519,  Tax credits for some expenditures that directly reduce taxes 
7,519,Because no deferred tax item is created for permanent differences all permanent differences  result in a difference between the company s effective tax rate and statutory tax rate  The  effective tax rate is also influenced by different statutory taxes should an entity conduct  business in more than one tax jurisdiction  The formula for the reported effective tax rate is thus  equal to 
8,519,Reported effective tax rate   Income tax expense   Pretax income  accounting profit 
9,519,The net change in deferred tax during a reporting period is the difference between the balance  of the deferred tax asset or liability for the current period and the balance of the previous period 
10,519,     Taxable Temporary Differences
11,519,Temporary differences are further divided into two categories namely taxable temporary  differences and deductible temporary differences  Taxable temporary differences are  temporary differences that result in a taxable amount in a future period when determining the  taxable profit as the balance sheet item is recovered or settled  Taxable temporary differences  result in a deferred tax liability when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its tax base and  in the case of a liability when the tax base of the liability exceeds its carrying amount 
12,519,Under US GAAP a deferred tax asset or liability is not recognized for unamortizable goodwill   Under IFRS a deferred tax account is not recognized for goodwill arising in a business  combination  Since goodwill is a residual the recognition of a deferred tax liability would  increase the carrying amount of goodwill  Discounting deferred tax assets or liabilities is  generally not allowed for temporary differences related to business combinations as it is for  other temporary differences

2,520,IFRS provides an exemption  that is deferred tax is not provided on the temporary difference   for the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that  a  is not a business  combination  e g  joint ventures branches and unconsolidated investments   and b  affects  neither accounting profit nor taxable profit at the time of the transaction  US GAAP does not  provide an exemption for these circumstances 
3,520,As a simple example of a temporary difference with no recognition of deferred tax liability  assume that a fictitious company Corporate International a holding company of various leisure  related businesses and holiday resorts buys an interest in a hotel in the current financial year   The goodwill related to the transaction will be recognized on the financial statements but the  related tax liability will not as it relates to the initial recognition of goodwill 
4,520,     Deductible Temporary Differences
5,520,Deductible temporary differences are temporary differences that result in a reduction or  deduction of taxable income in a future period when the balance sheet item is recovered or  settled  Deductible temporary differences result in a deferred tax asset when the tax base of an  asset exceeds its carrying amount and in the case of a liability when the carrying amount of the  liability exceeds its tax base  The recognition of a deferred tax asset is only allowed to the  extent there is a reasonable expectation of future profits against which the asset or liability  that  gave rise to the deferred tax asset  can be recovered or settled 
6,520,To determine the probability of sufficient future profits for utilization one must consider the  following     Sufficient taxable temporary differences must exist that are related to the same tax  authority and the same taxable entity  and    The taxable temporary differences that are  expected to reverse in the same periods as expected for the reversal of the deductible temporary  differences 
7,520,As with deferred tax liabilities IFRS states that deferred tax assets should not be recognized in  cases that would arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in transactions that are  not a business combination and when at the time of the transaction there is no impact on either  accounting or taxable profit  Subsequent to initial recognition under IFRS and US GAAP any  deferred tax assets that arise from investments in subsidiaries branches associates and  interests in joint ventures are recognized as a deferred tax asset 
8,520,IFRS and US GAAP allow the creation of a deferred tax asset in the case of tax losses and tax  credits  These two unique situations will be further elaborated on in Section    IAS    does not allow the creation of a deferred tax asset arising from negative goodwill  Negative goodwill  arises when the amount that an entity pays for an interest in a business is less than the net fair  market value of the portion of assets and liabilities of the acquired company based on the  interest of the entity

2,522,   Dividends receivable  As a result of non taxability the carrying amount equals the  tax base of dividends receivable  This constitutes a permanent difference and will  not result in the recognition of any deferred tax asset or liability  A temporary  difference constitutes a difference that will at some future date be reversed   Although the timing of recognition is different for tax and accounting purposes in  the end the full carrying amount will be expensed recognized as income  A  permanent difference will never be reversed  Based on tax legislation dividends  from a subsidiary are not recognized as income  Therefore no amount will be  reflected as dividend income when calculating the taxable income and the tax  base of dividends receivable must be the total amount received namely            The taxable income and accounting profit will permanently differ  with the amount of dividends receivable even on future financial statements as an  effect on the retained earnings reflected on the balance sheet 
3,522,   Development costs  The difference between the carrying amount and tax base is a  temporary difference that in the future will reverse  In this fiscal year it will  result in a deferred tax liability 
4,522,   Research costs  The difference between the carrying amount and tax base is a  temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset  Remember the  explanation in Section   for deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset arises  because of an excess amount paid for taxes  when taxable income is greater than  accounting profit  which is expected to be recovered from future operations   Based on accounting principles the full amount was deducted resulting in a lower  accounting profit while the taxable income by implication should be greater  because of the lower amount expensed

2,523,   Interest received in advance  Interest received in advance results in a temporary  difference that gives rise to a deferred tax asset  A deferred tax asset arises  because of an excess amount paid for taxes  when taxable income is greater than  accounting profit  which is expected to be recovered from future operations 
3,523,   Rent received in advance  The difference between the carrying amount and tax  base is a temporary difference that leads to the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
4,523,   Loan  There are no temporary differences as a result of the loan or interest paid  and thus no deferred tax item is recognized 
5,523,     Temporary Differences at Initial Recognition of Assets  and Liabilities
6,523,In some situations the carrying amount and tax base of a balance sheet item may vary at initial  recognition  For example a company may deduct a government grant from the initial carrying  amount of an asset or liability that appears on the balance sheet  For tax purposes such grants  may not be deducted when determining the tax base of the balance sheet item  In such  circumstances the carrying amount of the asset or liability will be lower than its tax base   Differences in the tax base of an asset or liability as a result of the circumstances described  above may not be recognized as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
7,523,For example a government may offer grants to Small Medium and Micro Enterprises   SMME  in an attempt to assist these entrepreneurs in their endeavors that contribute to the  country s GDP and job creation  Assume that a particular grant is offered for infrastructure  needs  office furniture property plant and equipment etc    In these circumstances although  the carrying amount will be lower than the tax base of the asset the related deferred tax may not  be recognized  As mentioned earlier deferred tax assets and liabilities should not be recognized  in cases that would arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in transactions that  are not a business combination and when at the time of the transaction there is no impact on  either accounting or taxable profit 
8,523,A deferred tax liability will also not be recognized at the initial recognition of goodwill   Although goodwill may be treated differently across tax jurisdictions which may lead to  differences in the carrying amount and tax base of goodwill IAS    does not allow the  recognition of such a deferred tax liability  Any impairment that an entity should for  accounting purposes impose on goodwill will again result in a temporary difference between its  carrying amount and tax base  Any impairment that an entity should for accounting purposes  impose on goodwill and if part of the goodwill is related to the initial recognition that part of  the difference in tax base and carrying amount should not result in any deferred taxation  because the initial deferred tax liability was not recognized  Any future differences between the  carrying amount and tax base as a result of amortization and the deductibility of a portion of  goodwill constitute a temporary difference for which provision should be made

2,524,The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination is determined on the  acquisition date and may differ from the previous carrying amount  It is highly probable that the  values of acquired intangible assets including goodwill would differ from their carrying  amounts  This temporary difference will affect deferred taxes as well as the amount of goodwill  recognized as a result of the acquisition 
3,524,     Investments in Subsidiaries Branches Associates and  Interests in Joint Ventures
4,524,Investments in subsidiaries branches associates and interests in joint ventures may lead to  temporary differences on the consolidated versus the parent s financial statements  The related  deferred tax liabilities as a result of temporary differences will be recognized unless both of the  following criterion are satisfied 
5,524,  The parent is in a position to control the timing of the future reversal of the temporary  difference and
6,524,  It is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the future 
7,524,With respect to deferred tax assets related to subsidiaries branches and associates and interests  deferred tax assets will only be recognized if the following criteria are satisfied 
8,524,  The temporary difference will reverse in the future and
9,524,  Sufficient taxable profits exist against which the temporary difference can be used 
10,524,   UNUSED TAX LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS
11,524,IAS    allows the recognition of unused tax losses and tax credits only to the extent that it is  probable that in the future there will be taxable income against which the unused tax losses and  credits can be applied  Under US GAAP a deferred tax asset is recognized in full but is then  reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax  asset will not be realized  The same requirements for creation of a deferred tax asset as a result  of deductible temporary differences also apply to unused tax losses and tax credits  The  existence of tax losses may indicate that the entity cannot reasonably be expected to generate  sufficient future taxable income  All other things held constant the greater the history of tax  losses the greater the concern regarding the company s ability to generate future taxable profits 
12,524,Should there be concerns about the company s future profitability then the deferred tax asset  may not be recognized until it is realized  When assessing the probability that sufficient taxable  profit will be generated in the future the following criteria can serve as a guide 
13,524,  If there is uncertainty as to the probability of future taxable profits a deferred tax asset as  a result of unused tax losses or tax credits is only recognized to the extent of the available  taxable temporary differences

2,525,  Assess the probability that the entity will in fact generate future taxable profits before the  unused tax losses and or credits expire pursuant to tax rules regarding the carry forward  of the unused tax losses 
3,525,  Verify that the above is with the same tax authority and based on the same taxable entity 
4,525,  Determine whether the past tax losses were a result of specific circumstances that are  unlikely to be repeated  and
5,525,  Discover if tax planning opportunities are available to the entity that will result in future  profits  These may include changes in tax legislation that is phased in over more than one  financial period to the benefit of the entity 
6,525,It is imperative that the timing of taxable and deductible temporary differences also be  considered before creating a deferred tax asset based on unused tax credits 
7,525,   RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF  CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX
8,525,Current taxes payable or recoverable from tax authorities are based on the applicable tax rates at  the balance sheet date  Deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that is expected to  apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled  With respect to the income tax for a  current or prior period not yet paid it is recognized as a tax liability until paid  Any amount  paid in excess of any tax obligation is recognized as an asset  The income tax paid in excess or  owed to tax authorities is separate from deferred taxes on the company s balance sheet 
9,525,When measuring deferred taxes in a jurisdiction there are different forms of taxation such as  income tax capital gains tax  any capital gains made  or secondary tax on companies  tax  payable on the dividends that a company declares  and possibly different tax bases for a balance  sheet item  as in the case of government grants influencing the tax base of an asset such as  property   In assessing which tax laws should apply it is dependent on how the related asset or  liability will be settled  It would be prudent to use the tax rate and tax base that is consistent  with how it is expected the tax base will be recovered or settled 
10,525,Although deferred tax assets and liabilities are related to temporary differences expected to be  recovered or settled at some future date neither are discounted to present value in determining  the amounts to be booked  Both must be adjusted for changes in tax rates 
11,525,Deferred taxes as well as income taxes should always be recognized on the income statement of  an entity unless it pertains to 
12,525,  Taxes or deferred taxes charged directly to equity or
13,525,  A possible provision for deferred taxes relates to a business combination 
14,525,The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets and liabilities should also be assessed  The  carrying amounts may change even though there may have been no change in temporary  differences during the period evaluated  This can result from

3,526,  Reassessments of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  or
4,526,  Changes in the expectations for how an asset will be recovered and what influences the  deferred tax asset or liability 
5,526,All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed at the balance sheet date  and measured against the criteria of probable future economic benefits  If such a deferred asset  is likely to be recovered it may be appropriate to recognize the related deferred tax asset 
6,526,Different jurisdictions have different requirements for determining tax obligations that can  range from different forms of taxation to different tax rates based on taxable income  When  comparing financial statements of entities that conduct business in different jurisdictions subject  to different tax legislation the analyst should be cautious in reaching conclusions because of the  potentially complex tax rules that may apply 
7,526,     Recognition of a Valuation Allowance
8,526,Deferred tax assets must be assessed at each balance sheet date  If there is any doubt whether  the deferral will be recovered then the carrying amount should be reduced to the expected  recoverable amount  Should circumstances subsequently change and suggest the future will lead  to recovery of the deferral the reduction may be reversed 
9,526,Under US GAAP deferred tax assets are reduced by creating a valuation allowance   Establishing a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax asset and income in the period in  which the allowance is established  Should circumstances change to such an extent that a  deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reduced the reversal will increase the deferred  tax asset and operating income  Because of the subjective judgment involved an analyst should  carefully scrutinize any such changes 
10,526,     Recognition of Current and Deferred Tax Charged Directly  to Equity
11,526,In general IFRS and US GAAP require that the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and  current income tax should be treated similarly to the asset or liability that gave rise to the  deferred tax liability or income tax based on accounting treatment  Should an item that gives  rise to a deferred tax liability be taken directly to equity the same should hold true for the  resulting deferred tax 
12,526,The following are examples of such items 
13,526,  Revaluation of property plant and equipment  revaluations are not permissible under US  GAAP  
14,526,  Long term investments at fair value 
15,526,  Changes in accounting policies 
16,526,  Errors corrected against the opening balance of retained earnings

2,527,  Initial recognition of an equity component related to complex financial instruments  and
3,527,  Exchange rate differences arising from the currency translation procedures for foreign  operations 
4,527,Whenever it is determined that a deferred tax liability will not be reversed an adjustment  should be made to the liability  The deferred tax liability will be reduced and the amount by  which it is reduced should be taken directly to equity  Any deferred taxes related to a business  combination must also be recognized in equity 
5,527,Depending on the items that gave rise to the deferred tax liabilities an analyst should exercise  judgment regarding whether the taxes should be included with deferred tax liabilities or whether  it should be taken directly to equity  It may be more appropriate simply to ignore deferred taxes 
6,527,EXAMPLE  
7,527,Taxes Charged Directly to Equity
8,527,The following information pertains to Anderson Company  a hypothetical company   A  building owned by Anderson Company was originally purchased for          on    January       For accounting purposes buildings are depreciated at   percent a year on  a straight line basis and depreciation for tax purposes is    percent a year on a straight  line basis  On the first day of      the building is revalued at           It is  estimated that the remaining useful life of the building from the date of revaluation is     years  Important  For tax purposes the revaluation of the building is not recognized

8,528,   December       On    December      different treatments for depreciation  expense result in a temporary difference that gives rise to a deferred tax liability  The  difference in the tax base and carrying amount of the building was a result of different  depreciation amounts for tax and accounting purposes  Depreciation appears on the  income statement  For this reason the deferred tax liability will also be reflected on the  income statement  If we assume that the applicable tax rate in      was    percent then  the resulting deferred tax liability will be                                    
9,528,   December       As of    December      the carrying amount of the building  remains greater than the tax base  The temporary difference again gives rise to a  deferred tax liability  Again assuming the applicable tax rate to be    percent the  deferred tax liability from the building is                                    
10,528,   December       On    December      the carrying amount of the building again  exceeds the tax base  This is not the result of disposals or additions but is a result of the  revaluation at the beginning of the      fiscal year and the different rates of  depreciation  The deferred tax liability would seem to be                                       but the treatment is different than it was for the      and        In      revaluation of the building gave rise to a balance sheet equity account namely   Revaluation Surplus  in the amount of         which is not recognized for tax  purposes 
11,528,The deferred tax liability would usually have been calculated as follows

2,529,The change in the deferred tax liability in      is        in                                 and it would seem in                                   In       although it would seem that the balance for deferred tax liability should be         the  revaluation is not recognized for tax purposes  Only the portion of the difference  between the tax base and carrying amount that is not a result of the revaluation is  recognized as giving rise to a deferred tax liability 
3,529,The effect of the revaluation surplus and the associated tax effects are accounted for in a  direct adjustment to equity  The revaluation surplus is reduced by the tax provision  associated with the excess of the fair value over the carry value and it affects retained  earnings                           
4,529,The deferred tax liability that should be reflected on the balance sheet is thus not          but only                             Given the balance of deferred tax  liability at the beginning of the      fiscal year in the amount of        the change in  the deferred tax liability is only                          
5,529,In the future at the end of each year an amount equal to the depreciation as a result of  the revaluation minus the deferred tax effect will be transferred from the revaluation  reserve to retained earnings  In      this will amount to a portion of depreciation  resulting from the revaluation                       minus the deferred tax effect of                       thus

7,534,   MU discloses a valuation allowance of       million  see Exhibit    against  gross deferred assets of       million in       Does the existence of this  valuation allowance have any implications concerning MU s future earning  prospects 
8,534,   How would MU s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities be affected if the  federal statutory tax rate was changed to    percent  Would a change in the rate  to    percent be beneficial to MU 
9,534,   How would reported earnings have been affected if MU were not using a  valuation allowance 
10,534,   How would MU s       million in net operating loss carryforwards in       see  Exhibit    affect the valuation that an acquiring company would be willing to  offer 
11,534,   Under what circumstances should the analyst consider MU s deferred tax liability  as debt or as equity  Under what circumstances should the analyst exclude MU s  deferred tax liability from both debt and equity when calculating the debt to  equity ratio 
12,534,Solution to   
13,534,According to Exhibit   MU s deferred tax assets expire gradually until            to       for the net operating loss carryforwards and      to      for the tax credit  carryforwards  
14,534,Because the company is still relatively young it is likely that most of these expirations  occur toward the end of that period  Because cumulative US tax net operating loss  carryforwards total      billion the valuation allowance could imply that MU is not  reasonably expected to earn      billion over the next    years  However as we can see  in Exhibit   MU earned a profit for      and      thereby showing that the allowance  could be adjusted downward if the company continues to generate profits in the future  and making it more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be recognized

2,535,Solution to   
3,535,MU s total deferred tax assets exceed total deferred tax liabilities by      million  A  change in the federal statutory tax rate to    percent from the current rate of    percent  would make these net deferred assets less valuable  Also because it is possible that the  deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be adjusted downward in the future  see  discussion to solution    the impact could be far greater in magnitude 
4,535,Solution to   
5,535,The disclosure in Exhibit   shows that the increase in the valuation allowance increased  the income tax provision as reported on the income statement by     million in        Additional potential reductions in the valuation allowance could similarly reduce  reported income taxes  actual income taxes would not be affected by a valuation  allowance established for financial reporting  in future years  see discussion to solution     
6,535,Solution to   
7,535,If an acquiring company is profitable it may be able to use MU s tax loss carryforwards  to offset its own tax liabilities  The value to an acquirer would be the present value of  the carryforwards based on the acquirer s tax rate and expected timing of realization   The higher the acquiring company s tax rate and the more profitable the acquirer the  sooner it would be able to benefit  Therefore an acquirer with a high current tax rate  would theoretically be willing to pay more than an acquirer with a lower tax rate 
8,535,Solution to   
9,535,The analyst should classify the deferred tax liability as debt if the liability is expected to  reverse with subsequent tax payment  If the liability is not expected to reverse there is  no expectation of a cash outflow and the liability should be treated as equity  By way of  example future company losses may preclude the payment of any income taxes or  changes in tax laws could result in taxes that are never paid  The deferred tax liability  should be excluded from both debt and equity when both the amounts and timing of tax  payments resulting from the reversals of temporary differences are uncertain 
10,535,   COMPARISON OF IFRS AND US GAAP
11,535,As mentioned earlier though IFRS and US GAAP follow similar conventions on many tax  issues there are some notable differences  such as revaluation   Exhibit   summarizes many of  the key similarities and differences between IFRS and US GAAP  Though both frameworks  require a provision for deferred taxes there are differences in the methodologies

8,540,SUMMARY
9,540,Income taxes are a significant category of expense for profitable companies  Analyzing income  tax expenses is often difficult for the analyst because there are many permanent and temporary  timing differences between the accounting that is used for income tax reporting and the  accounting that is used for financial reporting on company financial statements  The financial  statements and notes to the financial statements of a company provide important information  that the analyst needs to assess financial performance and to compare a company s financial  performance with other companies  Key concepts in this reading are as follows 
10,540,  Differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and accounting  purposes may result in taxable income differing from accounting profit  The discrepancy  is a result of different treatments of certain income and expenditure items 
11,540,  The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes as an  expense in the calculation of taxable income as the company expenses the tax basis of the  asset  If the economic benefit will not be taxable the tax base of the asset will be equal to  the carrying amount of the asset 
12,540,  The tax base of a liability is the carrying amount of the liability less any amounts that will  be deductible for tax purposes in the future  With respect to revenue received in advance  the tax base of such a liability is the carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that  will not be taxable in the future 
13,540,  Temporary differences arise from recognition of differences in the tax base and carrying  amount of assets and liabilities  The creation of a deferred tax asset or liability as a result  of a temporary difference will only be allowed if the difference reverses itself at some  future date and to the extent that it is expected that the balance sheet item will create  future economic benefits for the company

2,541,  Permanent differences result in a difference in tax and financial reporting of revenue   expenses  that will not be reversed at some future date  Because it will not be reversed at  a future date these differences do not constitute temporary differences and do not give  rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
3,541,  Current taxes payable or recoverable are based on the applicable tax rates on the balance  sheet date of an entity  in contrast deferred taxes should be measured at the tax rate that  is expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability settled 
4,541,  All unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities must be reassessed on the appropriate  balance sheet date and measured against their probable future economic benefit 
5,541,  Deferred tax assets must be assessed for their prospective recoverability  If it is probable  that they will not be recovered at all or partly the carrying amount should be reduced   Under US GAAP this is done through the use of a valuation allowance

21,546,A  decreased prospect for future profitability 
22,546,B  increased prospects for future profitability 
23,546,C  assets being carried at a higher value than their tax base 
24,546,SOLUTIONS
25,546,   C is correct  Because the differences between tax and financial accounting will correct  over time the resulting deferred tax liability for which the expense was charged to the  income statement but the tax authority has not yet been paid will be a temporary  difference  A valuation allowance would only arise if there was doubt over the company s  ability to earn sufficient income in the future to require paying the tax 
26,546,   A is correct  The taxes a company must pay in the immediate future are taxes payable 
27,546,   C is correct  Higher reported tax expense relative to taxes paid will increase the deferred  tax liability whereas lower reported tax expense relative to taxes paid increases the  deferred tax asset

2,547,   B is correct  If the liability is expected to reverse  and thus require a cash tax payment   the deferred tax represents a future liability 
3,547,   A is correct  If the liability will not reverse there will be no required tax payment in the  future and the  liability  should be treated as equity 
4,547,   C is correct  The deferred tax liability should be excluded from both debt and equity  when both the amounts and timing of tax payments resulting from the reversals of  temporary differences are uncertain 
5,547,   C is correct  Accounting items that are not deductible for tax purposes will not be  reversed and thus result in permanent differences 
6,547,   C is correct  Tax credits that directly reduce taxes are a permanent difference and  permanent differences do not give rise to deferred tax 
7,547,   A is correct  The capitalization will result in an asset with a positive tax base and zero  carrying value  The amortization means the difference is temporary  Because there is a  temporary difference on an asset resulting in a higher tax base than carrying value a  deferred tax asset is created 
8,547,    B is correct  The difference is temporary and the tax base will be lower  because of more  rapid amortization  than the carrying value of the asset  The result will be a deferred tax  liability 
9,547,    A is correct  The advances represent a liability for the company  The carrying value of the  liability exceeds the tax base  which is now zero   A deferred tax asset arises when the  carrying value of a liability exceeds its tax base 
10,547,    B is correct  The income tax provision in      was        consisting of        in  current income taxes of which       were deferred 
11,547,    B is correct  The effective tax rate of      percent                  was higher than  the effective rates in      and      
12,547,    A is correct  In      the effective tax rate on foreign operations was      percent                            and the effective US tax rate was                                   percent  In      the effective tax rate on foreign operations was       percent and the US rate was      percent  In      the foreign rate was      percent and  the US rate was      percent 
13,547,    B is correct  The valuation allowance is taken against deferred tax assets to represent  uncertainty that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the assets  By  decreasing the allowance Zimt is signaling greater likelihood that future earnings will be  offset by the deferred tax asset 
14,547,    C is correct  The valuation allowance is taken when the company will  more likely than  not  fail to earn sufficient income to offset the deferred tax asset  Because the valuation  allowance equals the asset by extension the company expects no taxable income prior to  the expiration of the deferred tax assets 
15,547,    A is correct  A lower tax rate would increase net income on the income statement and  because the company has a net deferred tax liability the net liability position on the  balance sheet would also improve  be smaller

2,548,    C is correct  The reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a corresponding  reduction in the income tax provision 
3,548,    B is correct  The net deferred tax liability was smaller in      than it was in       indicating that in addition to meeting the tax payments provided for in      the company  also paid taxes that had been deferred in prior periods 
4,548,    C is correct  The income tax provision at the statutory rate of    percent is a benefit of          suggesting that the pre tax income was a loss of                            The income tax provision was                                          
5,548,    C is correct  Accounting expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes result in a  permanent difference and thus do not give rise to deferred taxes 
6,548,    B is correct  Over the three year period changes in the valuation allowance reduced  cumulative income taxes by           The reductions to the valuation allowance were  a result of the company being  more likely than not  to earn sufficient taxable income to  offset the deferred tax assets 
7,548,NOTES
8,548, As defined under IAS    paragraph   
9,548, The terms  tax base  and  tax basis  are interchangeable   Tax basis  is more commonly used in the United  States  Similarly  carrying amount  and  book value  refer to the same concept 
10,548, Previously IAS    required recognition of deferred tax based on the deferred method  also known as the income  statement method  which focused on timing differences  Timing differences are differences in the recognition of  income and expenses for accounting and tax purposes that originate in one period and will reverse in a future  period  Given the definition of timing differences all timing differences are temporary differences such as the  different treatment of depreciation for tax and accounting purposes  although the timing is different with regard to  the allowed depreciation for tax and accounting purposes the asset will eventually be fully depreciated

3,550,   BONDS PAYABLE
4,550,This section discusses accounting for bonds payable a common form of long term debt  In some contexts  e g  some  government debt obligations  the word  bond  is used only for a debt security with a maturity of    years or longer   note   refers to a debt security with a maturity between   and    years  and  bill  refers to a debt security with a maturity of less than    years  In this reading we use the terms bond and note interchangeably because the accounting treatments of bonds payable and  long term notes payable are similar  In the following sections we discuss bond issuance  initial recognition and measurement    bond amortisation interest expense and interest payments  market rates and fair value  subsequent measurement   repayment of  bonds including retirements and redemptions  derecognition   and other issues concerning disclosures related to debt  We also  discuss debt covenants 
5,550,     Accounting for Bond Issuance
6,550,Bonds are contractual promises made by a company  or other borrowing entity  to pay cash in the future to its lenders  i e   bondholders  in exchange for receiving cash in the present  The terms of a bond contract are contained in a document called an  indenture  The cash or sales proceeds received by a company when it issues bonds is based on the value  price  of the bonds at  the time of issue  the price at the time of issue is determined as the present value of the future cash payments promised by the  company in the bond agreement 
7,550,Ordinarily bonds contain promises of two types of future cash payments     the face value of the bonds and    periodic interest  payments  The face value of the bonds is the amount of cash payable by the company to the bondholders when the bonds  mature  The face value is also referred to as the principal par value stated value or maturity value  The date of maturity of the  bonds  the date on which the face value is paid to bondholders  is stated in the bond contract and typically is a number of years  in the future  Periodic interest payments are made based on the interest rate promised in the bond contract applied to the bonds   face value  The interest rate promised in the contract which is the rate used to calculate the periodic interest payments is  referred to as the coupon rate nominal rate or stated rate  Similarly the periodic interest payment is referred to as the coupon  payment or simply the coupon  For fixed rate bonds  the primary focus of our discussion here  the coupon rate remains  unchanged throughout the life of the bonds  The frequency with which interest payments are made is also stated in the bond  contract  For example bonds paying interest semi annually will make two interest payments per year  
8,550,The future cash payments are discounted to the present to arrive at the market value of the bonds  The market rate of interest is the rate demanded by purchasers of the bonds given the risks associated with future cash payment obligations of the particular  bond issue  The market rate of interest at the time of issue often differs from the coupon rate because of interest rate fluctuations  that occur between the time the issuer establishes the coupon rate and the day the bonds are actually available to investors  If the  market rate of interest when the bonds are issued equals the coupon rate the market value  price  of the bonds will equal the  face value of the bonds  Thus ignoring issuance costs the issuing company will receive sales proceeds  cash  equal to the face  value of the bonds  When a bond is issued at a price equal to its face value the bond is said to have been issued at par 
9,550,If the coupon rate when the bonds are issued is higher than the market rate the market value of the bonds and thus the amount  of cash the company receives will be higher than the face value of the bonds  In other words the bonds will sell at a premium  to face value because they are offering an attractive coupon rate compared to current market rates  If the coupon rate is lower  than the market rate the market value and thus the sale proceeds from the bonds will be less than the face value of the bonds   the bond will sell at a discount to face value  The market rate at the time of issuance is the effective interest rate or borrowing  rate that the company incurs on the debt  The effective interest rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the two  types of promised future cash payments to their selling price  For the issuing company interest expense reported for the bonds  in the financial statements is based on the effective interest rate 
10,550,On the issuing company s statement of cash flows the cash received  sales proceeds  from issuing bonds is reported as a  financing cash inflow  On the issuing company s balance sheet at the time of issue bonds payable normally are measured and  reported at the sales proceeds  In other words the bonds payable are initially reported at the face value of the bonds minus any  discount or plus any premium

2,551,Using a three step approach the following two examples illustrate accounting for bonds issued at face value and then  accounting for bonds issued at a discount to face value  Accounting for bonds issued at a premium involves steps similar to the  steps followed in the examples below  For simplicity these examples assume a flat interest rate yield curve  i e  that the market  rate of interest is the same for each period   More precise bond valuations use the interest rate applicable to each time period in  which a payment of interest or principal occurs 
3,551,EXAMPLE  
4,551,Bonds Issued at Face Value
5,551,Debond Corp   a hypothetical company  issues          worth of five year bonds dated   January      when the  market interest rate on bonds of comparable risk and terms is   percent per annum  The bonds pay   percent interest  annually on    December  What are the sales proceeds of the bonds when issued and how is the issuance reflected in  the financial statements 
6,551,Solution 
7,551,Calculating the value of the bonds at issuance and thus the sales proceeds involves three steps     identifying key  features of the bonds and the market interest rate    determining future cash outflows and    discounting the future  cash flows to the present 
8,551,First identify key features of the bonds and the market interest rate necessary to determine sales proceeds

15,551,Each annual interest payment is the face value times the coupon rate                   If interest is paid other than annually adjust the interest rate to match the  interest payment period  e g  divide the annual coupon rate by two for semi annual  interest payments  
16,551,Second determine future cash outflows  Debond will pay bondholders          when the bonds mature in five years   On    December of each year until the bonds mature Debond will make an interest payment of        
17,551,Third sum the present value  of the future payments of interest and principal to obtain the value of the bonds and thus  the sales proceeds from issuing the bonds  In this example the sum is

2,552,The sales proceeds of the bonds when issued are           There is no discount or premium because these bonds are  issued at face value  The issuance is reflected on the balance sheet as an increase of cash and an increase in a long term  liability bonds payable of           The issuance is reflected in the statement of cash flows as a financing cash  inflow of          
3,552,The price of bonds is often expressed as a percentage of face value  For example the price of bonds issued at par as in  Example   is      i e      percent of face value   In Example   in which bonds are issued at a discount the price is         i e        percent of face value

35,552,In Example   the bonds were issued at a discount to face value because the bonds  coupon rate of   percent was less than the  market rate  Bonds are issued at a premium to face value when the bonds  coupon rate exceeds the market rate

2,553,Bonds issued with a coupon rate of zero  zero coupon bonds  are always issued at a discount to face value  The value of zero  coupon bonds is based on the present value of the principal payment only because there are no periodic interest payments 
3,553,Such issuance costs as printing legal fees commissions and other types of charges are costs incurred when bonds are issued   Under International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  all debt issuance costs are included in the measurement of the  liability bonds payable  Under US generally accepted accounting principles  US GAAP  companies generally used to show  these debt issuance costs as an asset  a deferred charge  which was amortised on a straight line basis to the relevant expense   e g  legal fees  over the life of the bonds  Under US GAAP debt issuance costs are deducted from the related debt liability   Companies reporting under US GAAP may still report debt issuance costs for lines of credit as an asset because the SEC  indicated that it would not object to this treatment  Under IFRS and US GAAP cash outflows related to bond issuance costs are  included in the financing section of the statement of cash flows usually netted against bond proceeds 
4,553,     Accounting for Bond Amortisation Interest Expense and Interest Payments
5,553,In this section we discuss accounting and reporting for bonds after they are issued  Most companies maintain the historical cost   sales proceeds  of the bonds after issuance and they amortise any discount or premium over the life of the bond  The amount  reported on the balance sheet for bonds is thus the historical cost plus or minus the cumulative amortisation which is referred to  as amortised cost  Companies also have the option to report the bonds at their current fair values 
6,553,The rationale for reporting the bonds at amortised historical cost is the company s intention to retain the debt until it matures   Therefore changes in the underlying economic value of the debt are not relevant from the issuing company s perspective  From  an investor s perspective however analysis of a company s underlying economic liabilities and solvency is more difficult when  debt is reported at amortised historical cost  The rest of this section illustrates accounting and reporting of bonds at amortised  historical cost  Section     discusses the alternative of reporting bonds at fair value 
7,553,Companies initially report bonds as a liability on their balance sheet at the amount of the sales proceeds net of issuance costs  under both IFRS and US GAAP ignoring any bond issuance costs  The amount at which bonds are reported on the company s  balance sheet is referred to as the carrying amount carrying value book value or net book value  If the bonds are issued at par  the initial carrying amount will be identical to the face value and usually the carrying amount will not change over the life of  the bonds   For bonds issued at face value the amount of periodic interest expense will be the same as the amount of periodic  interest payment to bondholders 
8,553,If however the market rate differs from the bonds  coupon rate at issuance such that the bonds are issued at a premium or  discount the premium or discount is amortised systematically over the life of the bonds as a component of interest expense  For  bonds issued at a premium to face value the carrying amount of the bonds is initially greater than the face value  As the  premium is amortised the carrying amount  amortised cost  of the bonds will decrease to the face value  The reported interest  expense will be less than the coupon payment  For bonds issued at a discount to face value the carrying amount of the bonds is  initially less than the face value  As the discount is amortised the carrying amount  amortised cost  of the bonds will increase to  the face value  The reported interest expense will be higher than the coupon payment 
9,553,The accounting treatment for bonds issued at a discount reflects the fact that the company essentially paid some of its borrowing  costs at issuance by selling its bonds at a discount  Rather than there being an actual cash transfer in the future this  payment   was made in the form of accepting less than the face value for the bonds at the date of issuance  The remaining borrowing cost  occurs as a cash interest payment to investors each period  The total interest expense reflects both components of the borrowing  cost  the periodic interest payments plus the amortisation of the discount  The accounting treatment for bonds issued at a  premium reflects the fact that the company essentially received a reduction on its borrowing costs at issuance by selling its  bonds at a premium  Rather than there being an actual reduced cash transfer in the future this  reduction  was made in the form  of receiving more than face value for the bonds at the date of issuance  The total interest expense reflects both components of  the borrowing cost  the periodic interest payments less the amortisation of the premium  When the bonds mature the carrying  amount will be equal to the face value regardless of whether the bonds were issued at face value a discount or a premium 
10,553,Two methods for amortising the premium or discount of bonds that were issued at a price other than par are the effective  interest rate method and the straight line method  The effective interest rate method is required under IFRS and preferred under  US GAAP because it better reflects the economic substance of the transaction  The effective interest rate method applies the  market rate in effect when the bonds were issued  historical market rate or effective interest rate  to the current amortised cost   carrying amount  of the bonds to obtain interest expense for the period  The difference between the interest expense  based on  the effective interest rate and amortised cost  and the interest payment  based on the coupon rate and face value  is the  amortisation of the discount or premium  The straight line method of amortisation evenly amortises the premium or discount  over the life of the bond similar to straight line depreciation on long lived assets  Under either method as the bond approaches  maturity the amortised cost approaches face value 
11,553,Example   illustrates both methods of amortisation for bonds issued at a discount  Example   shows amortisation for bonds  issued at a premium

24,554,Solution to   
25,554,Under the straight line method the discount  or premium  is evenly amortised over the life of the bonds  In this  example the        discount would be amortised by                  divided by   years  each year under the  straight line method  So the annual interest expense under the straight line method would be                   plus

6,556,The reporting of interest payments on the statement of cash flows can differ under IFRS and US GAAP  Under IFRS interest  payments on bonds can be included as an outflow in either the operating section or the financing section of the statement of  cash flows  US GAAP requires interest payments on bonds to be included as an operating cash outflow   Some financial  statement users consider the placement of interest payments in the operating section to be inconsistent with the placement of  bond issue proceeds in the financing section of the statement of cash flows   Typically cash interest paid is not shown directly  on the statement of cash flows but companies are required to disclose interest paid separately 
7,556,Amortisation of a discount  premium  is a non cash item and thus apart from its effect on taxable income has no effect on cash  flow  In the section of the statement of cash flows that reconciles net income to operating cash flow amortisation of a discount   premium  is added back to  subtracted from  net income 
8,556,     Current Market Rates and Fair Value Reporting Option
9,556,Reporting bonds at amortised historical costs  historical cost plus or minus the cumulative amortisation  reflects the market rate  at the time the bonds were issued  i e  historical market rate or effective interest rate   As market interest rates change the  bonds  carrying amount diverges from the bonds  fair market value  When market interest rates decline the fair value of a bond  with a fixed coupon rate increases  As a result a company s economic liabilities may be higher than its reported debt based on  amortised historical cost  Conversely when market interest rates increase the fair value of a bond with a fixed coupon rate  decreases and the company s economic liability may be lower than its reported debt  Using financial statement amounts based  on amortised cost may underestimate  or overestimate  a company s debt to total capital ratio and similar leverage ratios 
10,556,Companies recently have been given the option to report financial liabilities at fair values  Financial liabilities reported at fair  value are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  Even if a company does not opt to report financial  liabilities at fair value the availability of fair value information in the financial statements has increased  IFRS and US GAAP  require fair value disclosures in the financial statements unless the carrying amount approximates fair value or the fair value  cannot be reliably measured  
11,556,A company selecting the fair value option for a liability with a fixed coupon rate will report gains  losses  when market interest  rates increase  decrease   When market interest rates increase or other factors cause the fair value of a company s bonds to  decline the company reports a decrease in the fair value of its liability and a corresponding gain  When interest rates decrease  or other factors cause the fair value of a company s bonds to increase the company reports an increase in the fair value of its  liability and a corresponding loss  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair values are recognised in profit or loss 
12,556,Few companies have selected the option to report financial liabilities at fair value  Those that have are primarily companies in  the financial sector  Reporting standards for financial investments and derivatives already required these companies to report a  significant portion of their assets at fair values  Measuring financial liabilities at other than fair value when financial assets are  measured at fair value results in earnings volatility  This volatility is the result of using different bases of measurement for  financial assets and financial liabilities  Goldman Sachs elected to account for some financial liabilities at fair value under the  fair value option  In its fiscal year         K filing  page     Goldman explains this choice 
13,556,The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis  to mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes and to address simplification and cost  benefit considerations 
14,556,Most companies as required under IFRS and US GAAP disclose the fair values of financial liabilities  The primary exception  to the disclosure occurs when fair value cannot be reliably measured  Example   illustrates Sony s fair value disclosures  including the fair values of long term debt

4,557,Excerpt from Note    Summary of significant accounting policies
5,557,   The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities    permits companies to choose  to measure on an instrument by instrument basis various financial instruments and certain other items at  fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  The fair value measurement election is  irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings    Sony did not elect the fair  value option for any assets or liabilities that were not previously carried at fair value 
6,557,Excerpt from Note     Fair value measurements
7,557,The estimated fair values of Sony s financial instruments are summarised as follows  The following  summary excludes cash and cash equivalents call loans time deposits notes and accounts receivable trade  call money short term borrowings notes and accounts payable trade and deposits from customers in the  banking business because the carrying values of these financial instruments approximated their fair values  due to their short term nature

12,557,The fair values of long term debt including the current portion and investment contracts included in  policyholders  account in the life insurance business were estimated based on either the market value or the  discounted future cash flows using Sony s current incremental borrowing rates for similar liabilities 
13,557,Use the excerpts from the notes to Sony s financial statements to address the following questions 
14,557,   Does Sony report the fair values of its long term debt on the balance sheet 
15,557,   How does Sony measure the long term debt reported on the balance sheet 
16,557,   As of    March      and    March      what is the percent difference in the carrying amount and fair value of  Sony s long term debt 
17,557,Solution to   
18,557,Sony does not report the fair values of its long term debt on the balance sheet  Sony discloses that it did not elect the fair  value option for any assets or liabilities that were not previously carried at fair value in Note    In Note    we also  observe that Sony discloses the estimated fair value of long term debt separately from its carrying amount 
19,557,Solution to   
20,557,Notes   and    indicate that Sony did not elect the fair value option  Therefore the carrying amount of its debt must be  its amortised historical cost

2,558,In each year the fair value of Sony s long term debt is less than      greater than its carrying amount                                  on    March      and                              on    March       Although the  estimated fair values are higher the difference is small and would most likely not materially affect an analysis of the  company 
3,558,     Derecognition of Debt
4,558,Once bonds are issued a company may leave the bonds outstanding until maturity or redeem the bonds before maturity either  by calling the bonds  if the bond issue includes a call provision  or by purchasing the bonds in the open market  If the bonds  remain outstanding until the maturity date the company pays bondholders the face value of the bonds at maturity  The discount  or premium on the bonds would be fully amortised at maturity  the carrying amount would equal face value  Upon repayment  bonds payable is reduced by the carrying amount at maturity  face value  of the bonds and cash is reduced by an equal amount   Repayment of the bonds appears in the statement of cash flows as a financing cash outflow 
5,558,If a company decides to redeem bonds before maturity and thus extinguish the liability early bonds payable is reduced by the  carrying amount of the redeemed bonds  The difference between the cash required to redeem the bonds and the carrying amount  of the bonds is a gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt  Under IFRS debt issuance costs are included in the measurement  of the liability and are thus part of its carrying amount  Under US GAAP debt issuance costs are accounted for separately from  bonds payable and are amortised over the life of the bonds  Any unamortised debt issuance costs must be written off at the time  of redemption and included in the gain or loss on debt extinguishment 
6,558,For example a company reporting under IFRS has a     million bond issuance with a carrying amount equal to its face value  and five years remaining until maturity  The company redeems the bonds at a call price of      The redemption cost is        million        million          The company s loss on redemption would be      thousand      million carrying amount  minus       million cash paid to redeem the callable bonds  
7,558,A gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt is disclosed on the income statement in a separate line item when the amount is  material  A company typically discloses further detail about the extinguishment in the management discussion and analysis   MD A  and or notes to the financial statements   In addition in a statement of cash flows prepared using the indirect method  net income is adjusted to remove any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt from operating cash flows and the cash paid to  redeem the bonds is classified as cash used for financing activities   Recall that the indirect method of the statement of cash  flows begins with net income and makes necessary adjustments to arrive at cash from operations including removal of gains or  losses from non operating activities  
8,558,To illustrate the financial statement impact of the extinguishment of debt consider the notes payable repurchase by B H Ocean  Carriers in Example   below

55,559,  The carrying amount of the Company s variable rate long term debt approximates fair value 
56,559,Excerpt from NOTE    BONDS PAYABLE
57,559,On December         the Company issued     million of unsecured bonds  Interest on the bonds is  equal to Libor plus    payable quarterly in arrears    During the  th quarter of      the Company  repurchased the unsecured bonds with a face value of      million and realized a      million gain 
58,559,   The balance in bonds payable was reduced at redemption by

60,559,B           
61,559,C           
62,559,Solution to   
63,559,C is correct  The bonds payable is reduced at redemption by the carrying amount of the bonds redeemed  The cash paid  to extinguish the bonds plus the gain on redemption equals the carrying amount of the bonds  The carrying amount of  the bonds was           In this case the carrying amount equals the face value  The company recognised a gain of           when it extinguished the debt of          by paying only

2,560,     Debt Covenants
3,560,Borrowing agreements  the bond indenture  often include restrictions called covenants that protect creditors by restricting  activities of the borrower  Debt covenants benefit borrowers to the extent that they lower the risk to the creditors and thus  reduce the cost of borrowing  Affirmative covenants restrict the borrower s activities by requiring certain actions  For instance  covenants may require that the borrower maintain certain ratios above a specified amount or perform regular maintenance on  real assets used as collateral  Negative covenants require that the borrower not take certain actions  Covenants may restrict the  borrower s ability to invest pay dividends or make other operating and strategic decisions that might adversely affect the  company s ability to pay interest and principal 
4,560,Common covenants include limitations on how borrowed monies can be used maintenance of collateral pledged as security  if  any  restrictions on future borrowings requirements that limit dividends and requirements to meet specific working capital  requirements  Covenants may also specify minimum acceptable levels of financial ratios such as debt to equity current or  interest coverage 
5,560,When a company violates a debt covenant it is a breach of contract  Depending on the severity of the breach and the terms of  the contract lenders may choose to waive the covenant be entitled to a penalty payment or higher interest rate renegotiate or  call for payment of the debt  Bond contracts typically require that the decision to call for immediate repayment be made on  behalf of all the bondholders by holders of some minimum percentage of the principal amount of the bond issue

8,560,Illustration of Debt Covenant Disclosures
9,560,The following excerpt is from TORM A S from the Risk Factors section of Item   Key Information in its fiscal year          F filing  The excerpt illustrates debt covenants and their disclosure 
10,560,Certain of our loan agreements contain restrictive covenants which may limit our liquidity and corporate  activities and prevent proper service of debt which could result in the loss of our vessels 
11,560,Some loan agreements impose operating and financial restrictions upon us  These restrictions may limit our  ability to 
12,560,  change the management of our vessels without the lenders  consent  which they are not entitled to  unreasonably withhold   and
13,560,  enter into mergers or corporate restructurings or effect material divestments if such would be  materially adverse to the company 
14,560,Our lenders  interests may be different from ours and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain our  lenders  permission when needed  This may prevent us from taking actions that are in our best interest 
15,560,The following excerpt is an additional excerpt from  Note    Bonds Payable  of B H Ocean Carriers that was  referenced in Example   
16,560,The bond facility contains certain restrictive covenants which restrict the payment of dividends  The facility  requires a minimum value adjusted equity ratio  as defined  of      At December         the Company  was in compliance with these covenants and is likely to remain in compliance throughout       However  the bond agreement contains a cross default provision that essentially enables the lender to call the bonds if  the Company defaults on a separate loan facility  The Company reclassified its long term debt because of a  determination prospectively that certain covenants in certain long term agreements may be breached during        As such the Company has recorded the entire balance of the bonds as current as of December          
17,560,   Which of the covenants described in the above excerpts is an affirmative covenant 
18,560,   Based on the excerpt from B H Ocean Carriers what is the implied consequence of breaching certain covenants 
19,560,Solution to   
20,560,The requirement that  a minimum value adjusted equity ratio  as defined  of    percent  be maintained by B H Ocean  Carriers is an example of an affirmative covenant  It requires the issuer to do something  The covenants on TORM A S  require that TORM not take certain actions  e g  not change management of vessels without lenders  consent and not  enter into mergers that would be materially adverse  and are negative covenants

2,561,Solution to   
3,561,If B H Ocean Carriers breaches certain covenants it seems that the entire balance of bonds payable becomes due  The  bonds payable have been prospectively moved from non current to current liabilities 
4,561,     Presentation and Disclosure of Long Term Debt
5,561,The non current  long term  liabilities section of the balance sheet usually includes a single line item of the total amount of a  company s long term debt due after one year with the portion of long term debt due in the next twelve months shown as a  current liability  Notes to the financial statements provide more information on the types and nature of a company s debt  These  note disclosures can be used to determine the amount and timing of future cash outflows  The notes generally include stated and  effective interest rates maturity dates restrictions imposed by creditors  covenants  and collateral pledged  if any   The amount  of scheduled debt repayments for the next five years also is shown in the notes

17,562,   Why are the effective interest rates unchanged from      and      for the first    borrowings listed 
18,562,   Why does the carrying amount of the        Debentures due       remain the same in      and      
19,562,   Why does the carrying amount of the        Notes due       decrease from      to      
20,562,Solution to   
21,562,The effective interest rate is the market rate at which the bonds are issued and does not change from year to year 
22,562,Solution to   
23,562,The carrying amount of the        Debentures due       remains the same because the effective interest rate at which  the debentures were issued is the same as the coupon rate  The debentures were issued at par and the carrying amount  does not change 
24,562,Solution to   
25,562,The notes are denominated in euros with a face value of    billion  The dollar euro translation exchange rate at the end  of      was lower than the exchange rate at the end of              versus          That decline explains the decrease  in carrying value  Note that the face amount of the debt at the translation rate  at the end of         billion times                billion  is higher than the carrying amount  at the end of            billion   The reason for this difference is  that the notes were issued at a discount  the effective interest rate of      percent is higher than the      percent coupon  rate  The carrying amount of the notes thus reflects the amortisation of the discount at issuance  the amortisation of the  discount will increase the carrying amount 
26,562,In this reading we focus on accounting for simple debt contracts  Debt contracts can take on additional features which lead to  more complexity  For instance convertible debt and debt with warrants are more complex instruments that have both debt and  equity features  Convertible debt gives the debt holder the option to exchange the debt for equity  Bonds issued with warrants  give holders the right to purchase shares of the issuer s common stock at a specific price similar to stock options  Issuance of  bonds with warrants is more common by non US companies  Example   provides an example of a financial statement  disclosure of bonds with warrants issued by a Chinese company

4,563,Excerpt from NOTE     DEBENTURES PAYABLE
5,563,On    February      the Company issued convertible bonds with stock warrants due      with an  aggregate principal amount of RMB    billion in the PRC  the  Bonds with Warrants    The Bonds with  Warrants with fixed interest rate of      per annum and interest payable annually were issued at par value  of RMB      The Bonds with Warrants were guaranteed by Sinopec Group Company  Each lot of the  Bonds with Warrants comprising ten Bonds with Warrants are entitled to warrants  the  Warrants   to  subscribe      A shares of the Company during the   trading days prior to   March      at an initial  exercise price of RMB       per share subject to adjustment for amongst other things cash dividends  subdivision or consolidation of shares bonus issues rights issues capital distribution change of control and  other events which have a dilutive effect on the issued share capital of the Company

9,563,In addition to disclosures in the notes to the financial statements an MD A commonly provides other information about a  company s capital resources including debt financing and off balance sheet financing  In the MD A management often  provides a qualitative discussion on any material trends favorable or unfavorable in capital resources and indicates any  expected material changes in their mix and relative cost  Additional quantitative information is typically provided including  schedules summarising a company s contractual obligations  e g  bond payables  and other commitments  e g  lines of credit  and guarantees  in total and over the next five years 
10,563,   LEASES
11,563,A company wishing to obtain the use of an asset can either purchase the asset or lease the asset  Section     describes some  advantages to leasing from the viewpoint of the lessee  the party obtaining the use of an asset through a lease   Section      describes the classification of leases  Section       describes the accounting treatments of different types of leases from the  perspective of the lessee and section       discusses leases from the perspective of the lessor  the owner of the asset  
12,563,     Advantages of Leasing
13,563,A lease is a contract between the owner of an asset the lessor and another party seeking use of the asset the lessee   Through the lease the lessor grants the right to use the asset to the lessee  The right to use the asset can be for a long period  such as    years or a much shorter period such as a month  In exchange for the right to use the asset the lessee makes periodic  lease payments to the lessor  A lease then is a form of financing to the lessee provided by the lessor that enables the lessee to  obtain the use of the leased asset 
14,563,There are several advantages to leasing an asset compared to purchasing it  Leases can provide less costly financing  they  usually require little if any down payment and often are at lower fixed interest rates than those incurred if the asset was  purchased  This financing advantage is the result of the lessor having advantages over the lessee and or another lender  The  lessor may be in a better position to take advantage of tax benefits of ownership such as depreciation and interest  The lessor  may be better able to value and bear the risks associated with ownership such as obsolescence residual value and disposition  of asset  The lessor may enjoy economies of scale for servicing assets  As a result of these advantages the lessor may offer  attractive lease terms and leasing the asset may be less costly for the lessee than owning the asset  Further the negotiated lease  contract may contain less restrictive provisions than other forms of borrowing

2,564,Companies have also used certain types of leases because of perceived financial reporting and tax advantages  Although they  provide a form of financing certain types of leases are not shown as debt on the balance sheet  The items leased under these  operating leases have not appeared as assets on the balance sheet  Therefore no interest expense or depreciation expense is  included in the income statement  In addition in some countries including the United States because financial reporting  rules differ from tax regulations a company may own an asset for tax purposes  and thus obtain deductions for depreciation  expense for tax purposes  while not reflecting the ownership in its financial statements  A lease that is structured to provide a  company with the tax benefits of ownership while not requiring the asset to be reflected on the company s financial statements  is known as a synthetic lease 
3,564,     Finance  or Capital  Leases versus Operating Leases
4,564,There are two main classifications of leases  finance leases  or capital leases  and operating leases   The economic  substance of a finance  or capital  lease is very different from an operating lease as are the implications of each for the financial  statements for the lessee and lessor  In substance a finance  capital  lease is equivalent to the purchase of some asset  lease to  own  by the buyer  lessee  that is directly financed by the seller  lessor   An operating lease is an agreement allowing the lessee  to use some asset for a period of time as if it were a rental 
5,564,Under the existing IFRS standard  IAS     the classification of a lease as a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the  transfer of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset  If substantially all the risks and rewards are  transferred to the lessee the lease is classified as a finance lease and the lessee reports a leased asset and lease obligation on its  balance sheet  Otherwise the lease is reported as an operating lease in which case the lessee reports neither an asset nor a  liability only the lease expense  Similarly if the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to legal  ownership the lease is reported as a finance lease and the lessor reports a lease receivable on its balance sheet and removes the  leased asset from its balance sheet  Otherwise the lease is reported as an operating lease and the lessor keeps the leased asset  on its balance sheet  Examples of situations that would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease include the  following  
6,564,  The lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term 
7,564,  The lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the  date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain at the inception of the lease that the option will be  exercised 
8,564,  The lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if the title is not transferred 
9,564,  At the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the  fair value of the leased asset 
10,564,  The leased assets are of such a specialized nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications 
11,564,As mentioned previously a new IFRS standard for accounting for leases  IFRS     is applicable for financial years beginning    January       IFRS    defines a lease as a contract or part of a contract that conveys the right to use an asset  the underlying  asset  for a period of time in exchange for consideration  
12,564,Under IFRS    if a contract meets the above criteria the lessee is required to recognize all of its leases on the balance sheet   This involves recognizing both a  right to use  asset and a lease liability in the lessee s balance sheet  In essence IFRS     requires lessees to record both finance and operating leases in an identical manner that is as assets and associated liabilities in  the lessee s balance sheet 
13,564,Although accounting for leases under US GAAP is guided by a similar principle of the transfer of benefits and risks US GAAP  is more prescriptive in its criteria for classifying capital and operating leases  Under US GAAP   leases can be recognized as  either a capital  finance  or an operating lease  Four criteria are specified to identify when a lease is a capital lease   
14,564,   Ownership of the leased asset transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease 
15,564,   The lease contains an option for the lessee to purchase the leased asset cheaply  bargain purchase option  
16,564,   The lease term is    percent or more of the useful life of the leased asset 
17,564,   The present value of lease payments is    percent or more of the fair value of the leased asset 
18,564,Only one of these criteria has to be met for the lease to be considered a capital lease by the lessee  On the lessor side satisfying  at least one of these four criteria plus meeting revenue recognition requirements  that is being reasonably assured of cash  collection and having performed substantially under the lease  determine a capital lease  If none of the four criteria are met or if  the revenue recognition requirement is not met the lessor reports the lease as an operating lease

2,565,       Accounting and Reporting by the Lessee
3,565,Because a finance lease is economically similar to borrowing money and buying an asset a company that enters into a finance  lease as the lessee reports an asset  leased asset  and related debt  lease payable  on its balance sheet  The initial value of both  the leased asset and lease payable is the lower of the present value of future lease payments and the fair value of the leased  asset  in many cases these will be equal  On the income statement the company reports interest expense on the debt and if the  asset acquired is depreciable the company reports depreciation expense   The lessor as we illustrate in the next section reports  the sale of an asset and a lease as receivable   Note that following the introduction of IFRS    all contracts meeting the criteria  of a lease are classified as finance leases by the lessee and the lessor continues to classify leases as either financial or operating 
4,565,Because an operating lease is economically similar to renting an asset a company that enters into an operating lease as the  lessee records a lease expense on its income statement during the period it uses the asset  No asset or liability is recorded on its  balance sheet  This has led lessees to often prefer operating leases to finance leases   Although classifying a lease as an  operating lease can make reported profitability ratios and debt to equity ratios appear better financial analysts are aware of this  impact and typically adjust the reported numbers accordingly  
5,565,On the lessee s statement of cash flows for an operating lease the lease payment is shown as an operating cash outflow  For a  finance lease only the portion of the lease payment relating to interest expense potentially reduces operating cash flow  the  portion of the lease payment that reduces the lease liability appears as a cash outflow in the financing section

9,565,CAPBS Inc  enters into a lease agreement to acquire the use of a piece of machinery for four years beginning on    January       The lease requires four annual payments of        starting on   January       The useful life of the  machine is four years and its salvage value is zero  CAPBS accounts for the lease as a finance lease  The fair value of  the machine is          The present value of the lease payments using the company s discount rate of    percent is            A reminder is relevant for present value calculations  Lease payments are made at the beginning of each  period   The company uses straight line depreciation 
10,565,   Comment on the appropriateness of CAPBS treating the lease agreement as a finance lease under IFRS and a  capital lease under US GAAP 
11,565,   What is the amount reported as a leased asset on the balance sheet on   January       What depreciation expense  is reported in fiscal year      
12,565,   What is the amount of the machinery reported as a leased asset on the balance sheet on    December      
13,565,   What is the amount of the lease liability reported on the balance sheet on   January       What interest expense  is reported in fiscal year      
14,565,   What is the amount of the lease liability reported on the balance sheet on    December       What interest  expense is reported in fiscal year      
15,565,   If CAPBS had determined that the above lease was an operating lease what amount of expenses would be  reported on the income statements in fiscal      and       How does this expense compare to the expenses  reported under a capital lease 
16,565,Solution to   
17,565,CAPBS should treat this lease as a finance lease under IFRS  The machine is leased for the major part of its useful life   the useful life of the machine and the lease are each four years   Also the present value of lease payments equals  substantially the fair value of the machine  both are           CAPBS should treat this lease as a capital lease under  US GAAP  The machine is leased for more than    percent of its useful life and the present value of the lease payments  exceeds    percent of the fair value of the leased asset 
18,565,Solution to   
19,565,The amount initially reported as a leased asset on   January      is          Depreciation expense each year is                           years

5,567,Solution to   
6,567,As an operating lease a rent expense of        would be reported on the income statement each year  Under a capital  lease the expenses related to the lease are depreciation and interest expense  In      the depreciation expense is         and the interest expense is        In      the depreciation expense is        and the interest expense is        
7,567,A company reporting a lease as an operating lease will typically show higher profits in early years higher return measures in  early years and a stronger solvency position than an identical company reporting an identical lease as a finance lease  However  the company reporting the lease as a finance lease will show higher operating cash flows because the portion of the lease  payment that reduces the carrying amount of the lease liability will be reflected as a financing cash outflow rather than an  operating cash outflow  The interest expense portion of the lease payment on the statement of cash flows can be treated as  operating or financing cash outflow under IFRS and is treated as an operating cash outflow under US GAAP  However the  effect of reporting under either an operating lease or finance lease over the life of the lease is neutral with respect to pretax  profits 
8,567,The explicit standards in the United States that determine when a company should report a capital lease versus an operating  lease make it easier for a company to structure a lease so that it is reported as an operating lease  The company structures the  lease so that none of the four capital lease identifying criteria is met  Similar to debt disclosures however lease disclosures  show payments under both capital and operating leases for the next five years and afterward  These disclosures can help to  estimate the extent of a company s off balance sheet lease financing through operating leases  Example    illustrates the  disclosures of operating and finance leases  Although these disclosures can be used to determine the effect on the financial  statements if all operating leases were capitalized this reading focuses solely on the information that is disclosed

15,573,The debt to equity ratio increased to       percent in      from       percent in       This increase is primarily  attributable to an increase in short term debt  From Note     A  disclosures short term debt increased by       million   from       million in      to       million in       while the current portion of long term debt decreased by       million  from       million to       million  and the non current portion of debt increased by only       million   from        million to        million   The financing section of the statement of cash flows discloses that Shell  issued       million in short term debt in      compared with repaying short term debt in      
16,573,       Accounting and Reporting by the Lessor
17,573,Similar to accounting and reporting on the lessee side the lessor also must determine whether a lease is classified as operating  or finance  Under IFRS the determination of a finance lease on the lessor s side mirrors that of the lessee s  That is in a finance  lease the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to legal ownership    Under US GAAP the lessor  determines whether a lease is a capital or operating lease using the same four identifying criteria as a lessee plus the additional  revenue recognition criteria  That is the lessor must be reasonably assured of cash collection and has performed substantially  under the lease  From the lessor s perspective US GAAP distinguishes between types of capital leases  There are two main  types of capital leases from a lessor s perspective     direct financing leases and    sales type leases   
18,573,Under IFRS and US GAAP if a lessor enters into an operating lease the lessor records any lease revenue when earned  The  lessor also continues to report the leased asset on the balance sheet and the asset s associated depreciation expense on the  income statement 
19,573,Under IFRS if a lessor enters into a finance lease the lessor reports a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the  lease  the present value of the minimum lease payments receivable and any estimated unguaranteed residual value accruing to  the lessor     The leased asset is derecognised  assets are reduced by the carrying amount of the leased asset  Initial direct costs  incurred by a lessor other than a manufacturer or dealer lessor are added to the receivable and reduce the amount of income  recognised over the lease term  The lease payment is treated as repayment of principal  reduces lease receivable  and finance  income  The recognition of finance income should reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor s net investment in the  lease  Under the new IFRS on lease accounting  IFRS     lessors continue to recognize leases as either finance or operating  leases in a similar manner to IAS

2,574,For lessors that are manufacturers or dealers the initial direct costs are treated as an expense when the selling profit is  recognised  typically selling profit is recognised at the beginning of the lease term  Sales revenue equals the lower of the fair  value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments  The cost of sale is the carrying amount of the leased  asset less the present value of the estimated unguaranteed residual value 
3,574,Under US GAAP a direct financing lease results when the present value of lease payments  and thus the amount recorded as a  lease receivable  equals the carrying value of the leased asset  Because there is no  profit  on the asset itself the lessor is  essentially providing financing to the lessee and the revenues earned by the lessor are financing in nature  i e  interest revenue    If however the present value of lease payments  and thus the amount recorded as a lease receivable  exceeds the carrying  amount of the leased asset the lease is treated as a sales type lease 
4,574,Both types of capital leases have similar effects on the balance sheet  The lessor reports a lease receivable based on the present  value of future lease payments and derecognises the leased asset  The carrying value of the leased asset relative to the present  value of lease payments distinguishes a direct financing lease from a sales type lease  A direct financing lease is reported when  the present value of lease payment is equal to the value of the leased asset to the lessor  When the present value of lease  payments is greater than the value of the leased asset the lease is a sales type lease  The income statement effect will thus differ  based on the type of lease 
5,574,In a direct financing lease the lessor exchanges a lease receivable for the leased asset no longer reporting the leased asset on its  books  The lessor s revenue is derived from interest on the lease receivable  In a sales type lease the lessor  sells  the asset to  the lessee and also provides financing on the sale  Therefore in a sales type lease a lessor reports revenue from the sale cost of  goods sold  i e  the carrying amount of the asset leased  profit on the sale and interest revenue earned from financing the sale   The lessor will show a profit on the transaction in the year of inception and interest revenue over the life of the lease

13,574,   If DIRFIN had determined the above lease was an operating lease what amount of income would be reported on  the income statement in fiscal year      
14,574,Solution to   
15,574,Treating this lease as a finance lease under IFRS and a capital lease under US GAAP is appropriate  Under the old  international standard the lease needed to meet at least two of the suggested criteria for a finance lease     The lease  term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset and    at inception of the lease the present value of the  minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset  Under IFRS    most  long term leases are accounted for as finance leases  Under US GAAP the lease meets more than one of the required  criteria for a capital lease     The lease term is    percent or more of the useful life of the leased asset  the lease term  and useful life are both four years  and    the present value is    percent or more of the fair value of the leased asset   the present value of lease payments approximately equals the fair value of the machine   The revenue recognition  requirement also is met  Under US GAAP this capital lease is classified as a direct financing lease because the present  value of lease payment is equal to the value of the leased asset

6,576,Solution to   
7,576,Treating this lease as a finance lease under IFRS and a capital lease under US GAAP is appropriate 
8,576,Under IFRS the lease meets at least two of the suggested criteria for a finance lease     The lease term is for the major  part of the economic life of the asset  the lease term and useful life of the machine are both four years  and    at  inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair  value of the leased asset  the present value of lease payments equals the fair value of the machine   Note that under IFRS     the lessor needs to account for the lease as a finance lease even if the above criteria are not met 
9,576,Under US GAAP the lease meets more than one of the required capital lease criteria including the following     The  lease term is    percent or more of the useful life of the leased asset  the lease term and useful life of the machine are  both four years  and    the present value is    percent or more of the fair value of the leased asset  The revenue  recognition requirement also is met  Selnow is confident that the payments will be received   Further under US GAAP  this lease is classified as a sales type lease because the present value of the lease payments is greater than the carrying  amount of the leased asset 
10,576,There is no difference however in accounting between IFRS and US GAAP as a result of this additional classification  under US GAAP  The present value of the future lease payments is more than the lessor s carrying amount for the  machine and the difference is the lessor s profit from selling the machine  The lessor will record a profit of        on  the sale of the machine in               present value of lease payments receivable less        value of the  machine

25,577,   INTRODUCTION TO PENSIONS AND OTHER POST  EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
26,577,Pensions and other post employment benefits give rise to non current liabilities reported by many companies  Companies may  offer various types of benefits to their employees following retirement such as pension plans health care plans medical  insurance and life insurance  Pension plans often are the most significant post employment benefits provided to retired  employees 
27,577,The accounting and reporting for pension plans depends on the type of pension plan offered  Two common types of pension  plans are defined contribution pension plans and defined benefit pension plans  Under a defined contribution plan a  company contributes an agreed upon  defined  amount into the plan  The agreed upon amount is the pension expense  The  amount the company contributes to the plan is treated as an operating cash outflow  The only impact on assets and liabilities is a  decrease in cash although if some portion of the agreed upon amount has not been paid by fiscal year end a liability would be  recognised on the balance sheet  Because the amount of the contribution is defined and the company has no further obligation  once the contribution has been made accounting for a defined contribution plan is fairly straightforward

2,578,Accounting for a defined benefit plan is more complicated  Under a defined benefit plan a company makes promises of future  benefits to be paid to the employee during retirement  For example a company could promise an employee annual pension  payments equal to    percent of his final salary at retirement until death  Estimating the eventual amount of the obligation  arising from that promise requires the company to make many assumptions such as the employee s expected salary at  retirement and the number of years the employee is expected to live beyond retirement  The company estimates the future  amounts to be paid and discounts the future estimated amounts to a present value  using a rate reflective of a high quality  corporate bond yield  to determine the pension obligation  The discount rate used to determine the pension obligation  significantly affects the amount of the pension obligation  The pension obligation is allocated over the employee s employment  as part of pension expense 
3,578,Most defined benefit pension plans are funded through a separate legal entity typically a pension trust fund  A company makes  payments into the pension fund and retirees are paid from the fund  The payments that a company makes into the fund are  invested until they are needed to pay the retirees  If the fair value of the fund s assets is higher than the present value of the  estimated pension obligation the plan has a surplus and the company s balance sheet will reflect a net pension asset    Conversely if the present value of the estimated pension obligation exceeds the fund s assets the plan has a deficit and the  company s balance sheet will reflect a net pension liability    Thus a company reports either a net pension asset or a net  pension liability  Each period the change in the net pension asset or liability is recognised either in profit or loss or in other  comprehensive income 
4,578,Under IFRS the change in the net pension asset or liability each period is viewed as having three general components  Two of  the components of this change are recognised as pension expense in profit and loss      employees  service costs and     the net  interest expense or income accrued on the beginning net pension asset or liability  The service cost during the period for an  employee is the present value of the increase in the pension benefit earned by the employee as a result of providing one more  year of service  The service cost also includes past service costs which are changes in the present value of the estimated  pension obligation related to employees  service in prior periods such as might arise from changes in the plan  The net interest  expense or income is calculated as the net pension asset or liability multiplied by the discount rate used in estimating the present  value of the pension obligation  The third component of the change in the net pension asset or liability during a  period  remeasurements  is recognised in other comprehensive income  Remeasurements are not amortised into profit or  loss over time 
5,578,Remeasurements include  a  actuarial gains and losses and  b  the actual return on plan assets less any return included in the net  interest expense or income  Actuarial gains and losses can occur when changes are made to the assumptions on which a  company bases its estimated pension obligation  e g  employee turnover mortality rates retirement ages compensation  increases   The actual return on plan assets would likely differ from the amount included in the net interest expense or income  which is calculated using a rate reflective of a high quality corporate bond yield  plan assets are typically allocated across  various asset classes including equity as well as bonds 
6,578,Under US GAAP the change in net pension asset or liability each period is viewed as having five components some of which  are recognised in profit and loss in the period incurred and some of which are recognised in other comprehensive income and  amortised into profit and loss over time  The three components recognised in profit and loss in the period incurred are      employees  service costs for the period     interest expense accrued on the beginning pension obligation and     expected  return on plan assets which reduces the amount of expense recognised  The other two components are past service costs and  actuarial gains and losses  Past service costs are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise and  then subsequently amortised into pension expense over the future service period of the employees covered by the plan   Actuarial gains and losses are also recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and then  amortised into pension expense over time  In effect US GAAP allows companies to  smooth  the effects on pension expense  over time for these latter two components 
7,578,Similar to other forms of employee compensation for a manufacturing company the pension expense related to production  employees is added to inventory and expensed through cost of sales  cost of goods sold   For employees not involved directly in  the production process the pension expense is included with salaries and other administrative expenses  Therefore pension  expense is not directly reported on the income statement  Rather extensive disclosures are included in the notes to the financial  statements

2,579,The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans throughout the world  In a few countries the  group still operates defined benefit plans  The costs for the year for defined benefit plans are determined  using the projected unit credit method  This reflects services rendered by employees to the dates of  valuation and is based on actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the  present value of benefits projected rates of remuneration growth and long term expected rates of return for  plan assets  Discount rates are based on the market yields of high rated corporate bonds in the country  concerned

2,580,   EVALUATING SOLVENCY  LEVERAGE AND COVERAGE  RATIOS
3,580,Solvency refers to a company s ability to meet its long term debt obligations including both principal and interest payments  In  evaluating a company s solvency ratio analyses can provide information about the relative amount of debt in the company s  capital structure and the adequacy of earnings and cash flow to cover interest expense and other fixed charges  such as lease or  rental payments  as they come due  Ratios are useful to evaluate a company s performance over time compared to the  performance of other companies and industry norms  Ratio analysis has the advantage of allowing the comparison of companies  regardless of their size and reporting currency 
4,580,The two primary types of solvency ratios are leverage ratios and coverage ratios  Leverage ratios focus on the balance sheet and  measure the extent to which a company uses liabilities rather than equity to finance its assets  Coverage ratios focus on the  income statement and cash flows and measure the ability of a company to cover its debt related payments 
5,580,Exhibit   describes the two types of commonly used solvency ratios  The first three leverage ratios use total debt in the  numerator    The debt to assets ratio expresses the percentage of total assets financed with debt  Generally the higher the  ratio the higher the financial risk and thus the weaker the solvency  The debt to capital ratio measures the percentage of a  company s total capital  debt plus equity  financed through debt  The debt to equity ratio measures the amount of debt  financing relative to equity financing  A debt to equity ratio of     indicates equal amounts of debt and equity which is the  same as a debt to capital ratio of    percent  Interpretations of these ratios are similar  Higher debt to capital or debt to equity  ratios imply weaker solvency  A caveat must be made when comparing debt ratios of companies in different countries  Within  certain countries companies historically have obtained more capital from debt than equity financing so debt ratios tend to be  higher for companies in these countries

13,580,a In this reading debt is defined as the sum of interest bearing short term and long term debt 
14,580,b EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes 
15,580,The financial leverage ratio  also called the  leverage ratio  or  equity multiplier   measures the amount of total assets  supported by one money unit of equity  For example a value of   for this ratio means that each    of equity supports    of total  assets  The higher the financial leverage ratio the more leveraged the company in the sense of using debt and other liabilities to  finance assets  This ratio often is defined in terms of average total assets and average total equity and plays an important role in  the DuPont decomposition of return on equity   
16,580,The interest coverage ratio measures the number of times a company s EBIT could cover its interest payments  A higher  interest coverage ratio indicates stronger solvency offering greater assurance that the company can service its debt from  operating earnings  The fixed charge coverage ratio relates fixed financing charges or obligations to the cash flow generated  by the company  It measures the number of times a company s earnings  before interest taxes and lease payments  can cover  the company s interest and lease payments

4,582,B  Nokia s leverage ratios all increased from      to      suggesting weakening solvency  Comparing debt year to  year we observe that leverage ratios increased because of a significant increase in short term borrowings and an  increase in long term interest bearing debt without a similar increase in shareholders  equity  In fact shareholders   equity declined 
5,582,On the other hand Ericsson s leverage ratios appear fairly similar for      and       During      it appears as  though Ericsson shifted away from short borrowings to long term debt

15,582,C  Nokia s ability to cover interest payments is greater than Ericsson s although both companies appear to have  sufficient operating earnings to cover interest payments 
16,582,SUMMARY
17,582,Non current liabilities arise from different sources of financing and different types of creditors  Bonds are a common source of  financing from debt markets  Bonds are initially valued at fair value when issued and then companies have the choice of  whether to subsequently measure bonds at fair value or amortised cost 
18,582,Leases are related to the use of specific assets  In a finance lease the lessee assumes substantially all the risks and benefits of  ownership of the leased asset so the lessee reports an asset and related obligation  Typically the lessor will report a lease  receivable and derecognise the asset  In an operating lease the lessee secures the right to use the leased asset but substantially  all the risk and rewards of ownership are not transferred  The lessor does not derecognise the asset and reports lease  rent   income  Under IFRS    leases of more than one year are treated in a manner similar to finance leases that is as assets and  associated liabilities in the lessee s balance sheet 
19,582,Pensions and other post employment benefits are additional forms of compensation  Employees work currently to earn current  salaries and wages and also to earn benefits for retirement or post employment  Companies with defined contribution plans  report the agreed upon contribution paid into a plan as an expense  Defined benefit plans provide for agreed upon future  benefits  Understanding the reporting of non current liabilities when they arise and how they are subsequently valued is  important in assessing a company s solvency and potential changes in its solvency 
20,582,Key points in accounting and reporting of non current liabilities include the following 
21,582,  The sales proceeds of a bond issue are determined by discounting future cash payments using the market rate of interest at  the time of issuance  effective interest rate   The reported interest expense on bonds is based on the effective interest rate 
22,582,  Future cash payments on bonds usually include periodic interest payments  made at the stated interest rate or coupon rate   and the principal amount at maturity

2,583,  When the market rate of interest equals the coupon rate for the bonds the bonds will sell at par  i e  at a price equal to the  face value   When the market rate of interest is higher than the bonds  coupon rate the bonds will sell at a discount   When the market rate of interest is lower than the bonds  coupon rate the bonds will sell at a premium 
3,583,  An issuer amortises any issuance discount or premium on bonds over the life of the bonds 
4,583,  If a company redeems bonds before maturity it reports a gain or loss on debt extinguishment computed as the net  carrying amount of the bonds  including bond issuance costs under IFRS  less the amount required to redeem the bonds 
5,583,  Debt covenants impose restrictions on borrowers such as limitations on future borrowing or requirements to maintain a  minimum debt to equity ratio 
6,583,  The carrying amount of bonds is typically amortised historical cost which can differ from their fair value 
7,583,  Companies are required to disclose the fair value of financial liabilities including debt  Although permitted to do so few  companies opt to report debt at fair values on the balance sheet 
8,583,  Accounting standards have traditionally required leases to be classified as either operating leases or finance  capital   leases  Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of legal ownership are  transferred to the lessee 
9,583,  When a lessee reports a lease as an operating lease rather than a finance lease the lessee usually reports higher profits  before tax in the early years of the lease and lower profits in later years  however the impact on pretax profits will be  neutral between the choice of leases 
10,583,  When a lessor reports a lease as a finance lease rather than an operating lease the lessor usually appears more profitable  in the early years of the lease 
11,583,  In a finance lease where the present value of lease payments equals the carrying amount of the leased asset a lessor earns  only interest revenue  In a finance lease where the present value of lease payments exceeds the carrying amount of the  leased asset a lessor earns both interest revenue and a profit  or loss  on the sale of the leased asset 
12,583,  Two types of pension plans are defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans  In a defined contribution plan the  amount of contribution into the plan is specified  i e  defined  and the amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the  plan  received by the retiree  depends on the performance of the plan s assets  In a defined benefit plan the amount of  pension that is ultimately paid by the plan  received by the retiree  is defined usually according to a benefit formula 
13,583,  Under a defined contribution plan the cash payment made into the plan is recognised as pension expense 
14,583,  Under both IFRS and US GAAP companies must report the difference between the defined benefit pension obligation  and the pension assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
15,583,  Under IFRS the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is recognised as a cost of the period with two  components of the change  service cost and net interest expense or income  recognised in profit and loss and one  component  remeasurements  of the change recognised in other comprehensive income 
16,583,  Under US GAAP the change in the defined benefit plan net asset or liability is also recognised as a cost of the period  with three components of the change  current service costs interest expense on the beginning pension obligation and  expected return on plan assets  recognised in profit and loss and two components  past service costs and actuarial gains  and losses  recognised in other comprehensive income 
17,583,  Solvency refers to a company s ability to meet its long term debt obligations 
18,583,  In evaluating solvency leverage ratios focus on the balance sheet and measure the amount of debt financing relative to  equity financing 
19,583,  In evaluating solvency coverage ratios focus on the income statement and cash flows and measure the ability of a  company to cover its interest payments

3,590,   B is correct  The market interest rate at the time of issuance is the effective interest rate that the company incurs on the  debt  The effective interest rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the coupon payments and face value  to their selling price  Consequently the effective interest rate is       
4,590,   B is correct  The bonds will be issued at a discount because the market interest rate is higher than the stated rate   Discounting the future payments to their present value indicates that at the time of issue the company will record          as both a liability and a cash inflow from financing activities  Interest expense in      is                  times     percent   During the year the company will pay cash of        related to the interest payment but interest  expense on the income statement will also reflect       related to amortisation of the initial discount         interest  expense less the        interest payment   Thus the value of the liability at    December      will reflect the initial  value           plus the amortised discount         for a total of          The cash outflow of        may be  presented as either an operating or financing activity under IFRS

32,591,The carrying amount at the end of the year is found by adding the amortization of the discount to the carrying amount at  the beginning of the year  As a result the carrying amount on    December      is

35,591,    B is correct  The interest expense for a given year is equal to the carrying amount at the beginning of the year times the  effective interest of     Under the effective interest rate method the difference between the interest expense and the  interest payment  based on the coupon rate and face value  is the discount amortized in the period which increases the  carrying amount annually  For      the interest expense is the beginning carrying amount            times the  effective interest of

8,592,    B is correct  The amortization of the premium equals the interest payment minus the interest expense  The interest  payment is constant and the interest expense decreases as the carrying amount decreases  As a result the amortization of  the premium increases each year 
9,592,    B is correct  Under the straight line method the bond premium is amortized equally over the life of the bond  The annual  interest payment is                           and annual amortization of the premium under the straight line method  is                                    The interest expense is the interest payment less the amortization of the  premium                              
10,592,    C is correct  A gain of      million  carrying amount less amount paid  will be reported on the income statement 
11,592,    B is correct  If a company decides to redeem a bond before maturity bonds payable is reduced by the carrying amount of  the debt  The difference between the cash required to redeem the bonds and the carrying amount of the bonds is a gain or  loss on the extinguishment of debt  Because the call price is     and the face value is          the redemption cost is       of          or           The company s loss on redemption would be                 carrying amount of  debt minus          cash paid to redeem the callable bonds  
12,592,    A is correct  The value of the liability for zero coupon bonds increases as the discount is amortised over time   Furthermore the amortised interest will reduce earnings at an increasing rate over time as the value of the liability  increases  Higher relative debt and lower relative equity  through retained earnings  will cause the debt to equity ratio to  increase as the zero coupon bonds approach maturity 
13,592,    A is correct  When interest rates rise bonds decline in value  Thus the carrying amount of the bonds being carried on the  balance sheet is higher than the market value  The company could repurchase the bonds for less than the carrying amount  so the economic liabilities are overestimated  Because the bonds are issued at a fixed rate there is no effect on interest  coverage 
14,592,    C is correct  Affirmative covenants require certain actions of the borrower  Requiring the company to perform regular  maintenance on equipment pledged as collateral is an example of an affirmative covenant because it requires the  company to do something  Negative covenants require that the borrower not take certain actions  Prohibiting the borrower  from entering into mergers and preventing the borrower from issuing excessive additional debt are examples of negative  covenants 
15,592,    C is correct  Covenants protect debtholders from excessive risk taking typically by limiting the issuer s ability to use  cash or by limiting the overall levels of debt relative to income and equity  Issuing additional equity would increase the  company s ability to meet its obligations so debtholders would not restrict that ability 
16,592,    C is correct  The non current liabilities section of the balance sheet usually includes a single line item of the total amount  of a company s long term debt due after   year and the current liabilities section shows the portion of a company s long  term debt due in the next    months  Notes to the financial statements generally present the stated and effective interest  rates and maturity dates for a company s debt obligations
17,592,    B is correct  An operating lease is not recorded on the balance sheet  debt is lower  and lease payments are entirely  categorised as rent  interest expense is lower   Because the rent expense is an operating outflow but principal repayments  are financing cash flows the operating lease will result in lower cash flow from operating activity 
18,592,    B is correct  The lessee will disclose the future obligation by maturity of its operating leases  The future obligations by  maturity leased assets and lease liabilities will all be shown for finance leases 
19,592,    B is correct  When a lease is classified as an operating lease the underlying asset remains on the lessor s balance sheet   The lessor will record a depreciation expense that reduces the asset s value over time 
20,592,    A is correct  A sales type lease treats the lease as a sale of the asset and revenue is recorded at the time of sale equal to  the present value of future lease payments  Under a direct financing lease only interest income is reported as earned   Under an operating lease revenue from rent is reported when collected 
21,592,    A is correct  A portion of the payments for capital leases either direct financing or sales type is reported as interest  income  With an operating lease all revenue is recorded as rental revenue 
22,592,    A is correct  An operating lease is an agreement that allows the lessee to use an asset for a period of time  Thus an  operating lease is similar to renting an asset whereas a finance lease is equivalent to the purchase of an asset by the lessee  that is directly financed by the lessor

2,593,    C is correct  If the present value of the lease payments is greater than     of the fair value of the asset the lease is  considered a capital lease  A lease with a term that is     or more of the useful life of the asset is deemed to be a capital  lease  The option to purchase the asset must be deemed to be cheap  bargain purchase option  not just include the option  to purchase the asset 
3,593,    A is correct  A finance lease is similar to borrowing money and buying an asset  a company that enters into a finance  lease as the lessee reports an asset  leased asset  and related debt  lease payable  on its balance sheet  A company that  enters into a finance lease as the lessee will report interest expense and depreciation expense on its income statement  A  company that enters into an operating lease will report the lease payment on its income statement  For a finance lease  only the portion of the lease payment relating to interest expense reduces operating cash flow  the portion of the lease  payment that reduces the lease liability appears as a cash outflow in the financing section  A company that enters into an  operating lease as the lessee will report the full lease payment as an operating cash outflow 
4,593,    A is correct  A company that enters into a finance lease reports the value of both the leased asset and lease payable as the  lower of the present value of future lease payments and the fair value of the leased asset  The present value of the future  lease payments           is lower than the fair market value of the leased asset            The company will  record a lease payable on the balance sheet of           
5,593,    B is correct  An operating lease is economically similar to renting an asset  A company that enters into an operating lease  as a lessee reports a lease expense on its income statement during the period it uses the asset and reports no asset or  liability on its balance sheet  The operating lease is disclosed in notes to the financial statements 
6,593,    C is correct  The current debt to total capital ratio is                            To adjust for the lease commitments an  analyst should add      to both the numerator and denominator                            
7,593,    C is correct  The financial leverage ratio is calculated as follows 
8,593,Average total assets Average shareholder s equity
9,593, 
10,593,       million        million
11,593,         million
12,593,    B is correct  Company B has the lowest debt to equity ratio indicating the lowest financial leverage and the highest  interest coverage ratio indicating the greatest number of times that EBIT covers interest payments 
13,593,    A is correct because the debt to assets  total debt   total assets  ratio is                                       
14,593,    B is correct  The company will report a net pension obligation of    million equal to the pension obligation      million   less the plan assets     million  
15,593,    A is correct  A company that offers a defined benefit plan makes payments into a pension fund and the retirees are paid  from the fund  The payments that a company makes into the fund are invested until they are needed to pay retirees  If the  fair value of the fund s assets is higher than the present value of the estimated pension obligation the plan has a surplus  and the company s balance sheet will reflect a net pension asset  Because the fair value of the fund s assets is              and the present value of estimated pension obligations is             the company will present a net  pension asset of            on its balance sheet 
16,593,NOTES
17,593, Interest rates are stated on an annual basis regardless of the frequency of payment 
18,593, Alternative ways to calculate the present value include    to treat the five annual interest payments as an annuity and use the formula for finding the  present value of an annuity and then add the present value of the principal payment or    to use a financial calculator to calculate the total present value

20,596,   INTRODUCTION
21,596,Ideally analysts would always have access to financial reports that are based on sound financial reporting standards  such as those from the International Accounting Standards Board  IASB  and the Financial Accounting Standards  Board  FASB  and are free from manipulation  But in practice the quality of financial reports can vary greatly  High  quality financial reporting provides information that is useful to analysts in assessing a company s performance and  prospects  Low quality financial reporting contains inaccurate misleading or incomplete information

2,597,Extreme lapses in financial reporting quality have given rise to high profile scandals that resulted not only in investor  losses but also in reduced confidence in the financial system  Financial statement users who were able to accurately  assess financial reporting quality were better positioned to avoid losses  These lapses illustrate the challenges analysts  face as well as the potential costs of failing to recognize practices that result in misleading or inaccurate financial  reports   Examples of misreporting can provide an analyst with insight into various signals that may indicate poor  quality financial reports 
3,597,It is important to be aware however that high profile financial scandals reflect only those instances of misreporting  that were identified  Although no one can know the extent of undetected misreporting some research suggests that it is  relatively widespread  An Ernst   Young      survey of more than      board members executives managers and  other employees in    countries across Europe the Middle East India and Africa indicates that     of the respondents  had seen manipulation  such as overstated sales and understated costs  occurring in their own companies and     of  board directors and senior managers were aware of some type of irregular financial reporting in their own companies   Ernst   Young        Another survey of     chief financial officers of public US companies found that they  believed on average that about     of companies intentionally distort earnings to misrepresent economic  performance even while adhering to US GAAP and for such companies the magnitude of misrepresentation is about      of reported earnings  Dichev Graham Harvey and Rajgopal      and       
4,597,This reading addresses financial reporting quality which pertains to the quality of information in financial reports  including disclosures in notes  High quality reporting provides decision useful information which is relevant and  faithfully represents the economic reality of the company s activities during the reporting period as well as the  company s financial condition at the end of the period  A separate but interrelated attribute of quality is quality of  reported results or earnings quality which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company s actual  economic activities and the resulting financial condition  The term  earnings quality  is commonly used in practice and  will be used broadly to encompass the quality of earnings cash flow and or balance sheet items  High quality earnings  result from activities that a company will likely be able to sustain in the future and provide a sufficient return on the  company s investment  The concepts of earnings quality and financial reporting quality are interrelated because a  correct assessment of earnings quality is possible only when there is some basic level of financial reporting quality   Beyond this basic level as the quality of reporting increases the ability of financial statement users to correctly assess  earnings quality and to develop expectations for future performance arguably also increases 
5,597,Section   provides a conceptual overview of reporting quality  Section   discusses motivations that might cause and  conditions that might enable management to issue financial reports that are not high quality and mechanisms that aim  to provide discipline to financial reporting quality  Section   describes choices made by management that can affect  financial reporting quality presentation choices accounting methods and estimates as well as warning signs of  poor quality financial reporting 
6,597,   CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW
7,597,As indicated in the introduction financial reporting quality and results or earnings quality are interrelated attributes of  quality  Exhibit   illustrates this interrelationship and its implications

2,598,As can be seen in Exhibit   if financial reporting quality is low the information provided is not useful to assess the  company s performance and thus to make investment and other decisions 
3,598,Financial reporting quality varies across companies  High quality reports contain information that is relevant complete  neutral and free from error  The lowest quality reports contain information that is pure fabrication  Earnings  results   quality can range from high and sustainable to low and unsustainable  Providers of resources prefer high and  sustainable earnings  Combining the two measures of quality financial reporting and earnings the overall quality of  financial reports from a user perspective can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest to the lowest   Exhibit   presents a quality spectrum that provides a basis for evaluating better versus poorer quality reports  This  spectrum ranges from reports that are of high financial reporting quality and reflect high and sustainable earnings  quality to reports that are not useful because of poor financial reporting quality 
4,598,Exhibit    Quality Spectrum of Financial Reports
5,598,     GAAP Decision Useful Sustainable and Adequate Returns
6,598,At the top of the spectrum labeled in Exhibit   as  GAAP decision useful sustainable and adequate returns  are high  quality reports that provide useful information about high quality earnings 
7,598,  High quality financial reports conform to the generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  of the  jurisdiction such as International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS  US GAAP or other home country  GAAP  The exhibit uses the term GAAP to refer generically to the accounting standards accepted in a company s  jurisdiction 
8,598,  In addition to conforming to GAAP high quality financial reports also embody the characteristics of decision  useful information such as those defined in the Conceptual Framework   Recall that the fundamental  characteristics of useful information are relevance and faithful representation  Relevant information is defined as  information that can affect a decision and encompasses the notion of materiality   Information is considered  material if  omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that users make on the basis of the financial  information of a specific reporting entity     Faithful representation of economic events is complete neutral and  free from error

2,599,The Conceptual Framework also enumerates enhancing characteristics of useful information  comparability  verifiability timeliness and understandability  Of course the desirable characteristics for financial information  require trade offs  For example financial reports must balance the aim of providing information that is produced  quickly enough to be timely and thus relevant and yet not so quickly that errors occur  Financial reports must  balance the aim of providing information that is complete but not so exhaustive that immaterial information is  included  High quality information results when these and other tradeoffs are made in an unbiased skillful  manner 
3,599,  High quality earnings indicate an adequate level of return on investment and derive from activities that a  company will likely be able to sustain in the future  An adequate level of return on investment exceeds the cost of  the investment and also equals or exceeds the expected return  Sustainable activities and sustainable earnings are  those expected to recur in the future  Sustainable earnings that provide a high return on investment contribute to  higher valuation of a company and its securities 
4,599,     GAAP Decision Useful but Sustainable 
5,599,The next level down in Exhibit    GAAP decision useful but sustainable   refers to circumstances in which high  quality reporting provides useful information but that information reflects results or earnings that are not sustainable   lower earnings quality   The earnings may not be sustainable because the company cannot expect earnings that  generate the same level of return on investment in the future or because the earnings although replicable will not  generate sufficient return on investment to sustain the company  Earnings quality is low in both cases  Reporting can be  high quality even when the economic reality being depicted is not of high quality  For example consider a company  that generates a loss or earnings that do not provide an adequate return on investment or earnings that resulted from  non recurring activities  The relatively undesirable economic reality could nonetheless be depicted in financial  reporting that provides high quality decision useful information 
6,599,Exhibit   presents an excerpt from the fiscal year      first quarter results of Toyota Motor Corporation a Japanese  automobile company  As highlighted by a Wall Street Journal article  the company sold fewer cars but reported an      increase in operating profits compared with the prior year primarily because of the change in exchange rates  The  weaker yen benefited Toyota both because the company manufacturers more cars in Japan  compared with its  competitors  and because the company sells a significant number of cars outside of Japan  Exchange rate weakening is  a less sustainable source of profits than manufacturing and selling cars  In summary this example is a case of high  quality financial reporting coupled with lower earnings quality

10,599,     Biased Accounting Choices
11,599,The next level down in the spectrum in Exhibit   is  Within GAAP but biased choices   Biased choices result in  financial reports that do not faithfully represent economic phenomena  The problem with bias in financial reporting as  with other deficiencies in financial reporting quality is that it impedes an investor s ability to correctly assess a  company s past performance to accurately forecast future performance and thus to appropriately value the company

2,600,Choices are deemed to be  aggressive  if they increase a company s reported performance and financial position in the  current period  The choice can increase the amount of revenues earnings and or operating cash flow reported in the  period or decrease the amount of expenses reported in the period and or the amount of debt reported on the balance  sheet  Aggressive choices may decrease the company s reported performance and financial position in later periods  In  contrast choices are deemed  conservative  if they decrease a company s reported performance and financial position  in the current period  Conservative choices may decrease the amount of revenues earnings and or operating cash flow  reported in the period or increase the amount of expenses reported in the period and or the amount of debt reported on  the balance sheet  Conservative choices may increase the company s reported performance and financial position in  later periods 
3,600,Another type of bias is understatement of earnings volatility so called earnings  smoothing   Earnings smoothing can  result from conservative choices to understate earnings in periods when a company s operations are performing well  plus aggressive choices in periods when the company s operations are struggling 
4,600,Biased choices can be made not only in the context of reported amounts but also in the context of how information is  presented  For example companies can disclose information transparently and in a manner that facilitates analysis or  they can disclose information in a manner that aims to obscure unfavorable information and or to emphasize favorable  information

12,601,   Based on the segment data excerpted from the notes to the financial statements was PACCAR s truck  segment profitable in      
13,601,   Based on the data about the truck s gross margin presented in the MD A was PACCAR s truck segment  profitable in      
14,601,   What is the main difference between the note presentation and the MD A presentation 
15,601,   The SEC complaint stated that  PACCAR failed to report the operating results of its aftermarket parts  business separately from its truck sales business as required under segment reporting requirements which  are in place to ensure that investors gain the same insight into a company as its executives   Is the  PACCAR situation an example of issues with financial reporting quality earnings quality or both 
16,601,Solution to   
17,601,Yes the segment data presented in the note to the financial statements indicates that the Truck segment earned        million in      
18,601,Solution to   
19,601,No the segment data presented in the MD A indicates that the Truck segment had a negative gross margin 
20,601,Solution to   
21,601,The main difference between the note presentation and the MD A presentation is that the aftermarket parts  business is combined with the trucks business in the notes but separated in the MD A  Although the data are  not exactly comparable in the two disclosures  because the note shows income before taxes and the MD A  shows gross profit  the two disclosures present a different picture of PACCAR s profits from truck sales 
22,601,Solution to   
23,601,The PACCAR situation appears to be an example of issues with both financial reporting quality and earnings  quality  The substantial decrease in truck sales and the negative gross margin reflect poor earnings quality  The  failure to disclose clear segment information is an instance of poor financial reporting quality

2,602,While choices exist within GAAP for the presentation of a desired economic picture non GAAP reporting adds yet  another dimension of management discretion  Non GAAP reporting includes both non GAAP financial metrics and  non GAAP operating metrics   Non GAAP financial metrics relate directly to the financial statements  A common non  GAAP financial metric is  non GAAP earnings  which are earnings metrics created by reporting companies  that  adjust standards compliant earnings to exclude items required by accounting standards or to include items not permitted by accounting standards   Ciesielski and Henry        In contrast non GAAP operating metrics do not relate directly  to the financial statements and include metrics that are typically industry driven such as subscribers active users and  occupancy rates 
3,602,Non GAAP financial reporting has become increasingly common  this development presents challenges to analysts  An  important challenge is that non GAAP financial reporting diminishes comparability across financial statements  The  adjustments that companies make to create non GAAP earnings for example are generally ad hoc and thus differ  significantly across companies  When evaluating non GAAP financial metrics investors must decide the extent to  which specific adjustments should be incorporated into their analysis  In general for all non GAAP metrics investors  need to decide how such metrics should be incorporated into their analyses and forecasts  
4,602,Management emphasis on non GAAP financial measures such as pro forma earnings  also sometimes called  adjusted  earnings   to deflect attention from less than desirable financial results is an example of an aggressive presentation  choice 
5,602,Since      if a company uses a non GAAP financial measure  in an SEC filing it is required to display the most  directly comparable GAAP measure with equal prominence and to provide a reconciliation between the non GAAP  measure and the equivalent GAAP measure  In other words a company is not allowed to give more prominence to a  non GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing 
6,602,Similarly the IFRS Practice Statement  Management Commentary  issued December      requires disclosures when  non IFRS measures are included in financial reports 
7,602,If information from the financial statements has been adjusted for inclusion in management commentary  that fact should be disclosed  If financial performance measures that are not required or defined by IFRSs  are included within management commentary those measures should be defined and explained including  an explanation of the relevance of the measure to users  When financial performance measures are derived  or drawn from the financial statements those measures should be reconciled to measures presented in the  financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs   Page    
8,602,The reconciliation between as reported measures  GAAP financial measures presented in the financial statements  and  as adjusted measures  non GAAP financial measures presented in places other than the financial statements  can  provide important information

15,603,A  The first page of the interim report includes the following statement as a second quarter       highlight   Nokia Group achieved underlying operating profitability for the fourth consecutive  quarter with a Q  non IFRS operating margin of          
16,603,B  Nokia s Consolidated Income Statements  found on page    of the interim report  report a EUR     million net loss

2,604,Solution to   
3,604,As shown in Note   the company uses the term  underlying  to refer to non IFRS metrics  The non IFRS  metric disclosed in A  non IFRS operating margin  by definition does not appear within financial  statements prepared in accordance with IFRS  Here it is referred to as a non IFRS metric because information  on the company s financial statements has been adjusted  In contrast the IFRS metric disclosed in B  net loss   is clearly presented on an income statement prepared in accordance with IFRS  Another difference between  Disclosures A and B is that they refer to two different metrics  A refers to operating profit and B refers to net  profit  loss   These two items appear on two different lines of the income statement  In general operating profit   or operating loss  is before deductions for non operating items such as interest and taxes  The company s  operating profit in accordance with IFRS was a negative EUR    million in other words a EUR    million  operating loss  Note that as shown in Exhibit   the second quarter non IFRS operating profit was EUR     million and second quarter net sales totaled EUR     million  As indicated in Disclosure A the non IFRS  operating margin is                   
4,604,Overall there are three key differences between Disclosures A and B      A refers to a non IFRS metric rather  than an IFRS metric      A refers to operating profit which was positive rather than to net income which was  negative  and     A highlights a positive economic outcome  An analyst should be aware of the alternative  means by which earnings announcements can paint a positive picture of companies  results 
5,604,Solution to   
6,604,The heading  Q       EUR    million  refers to the difference between the company s non IFRS operating  profit of EUR    million and the company s operating loss of EUR    million calculated in accordance with  IFRS  The next lines indicate the components of the EUR    million that were excluded when calculating the  non IFRS operating profit but included when calculating the IFRS operating profit  loss  
7,604,Often poor reporting quality occurs simultaneously with poor earnings quality  for example aggressive accounting  choices are made to obscure poor performance  It is also possible of course for poor reporting quality to occur with  high quality earnings  Although a company with good performance would not require aggressive accounting choices to  obscure poor performance it might nonetheless produce poor quality reports for other reasons  A company with good  performance might be unable to produce high quality reports because of inadequate internal systems 
8,604,Another scenario in which poor reporting quality might occur simultaneously with high quality earnings is that a  company with good performance might deliberately produce reports based on  conservative  rather than aggressive  accounting choices that is choices that make current performance look worse  One motivation might be to avoid  unwanted political attention  Another motivation could arise in a period in which management had already exceeded  targets before the end of the period and thus made conservative accounting choices that would delay reporting profits  until the following period  so called  hidden reserves    Similar motivations might also contribute to accounting  choices that create the appearance that the trajectory of future results would appear more attractive  For example a  company might make choices to accelerate losses in the first year of an acquisition or the first year of a new CEO s  tenure so that the trajectory of future results would appear more attractive 
9,604,Overall unbiased financial reporting is the ideal and the preference  Investors may prefer conservative choices rather  than aggressive ones however because a positive surprise is easier to tolerate than a negative surprise  Biased  reporting whether conservative or aggressive adversely affects a user s ability to assess a company 
10,604,The quality spectrum considers the more intuitive situation in which less than desired underlying economics are the  central motivation for poor reporting quality  In addition it is necessary to have some degree of reporting quality in  order to evaluate earnings quality  Proceeding down the spectrum therefore the concepts of reporting quality and  earnings quality become progressively less distinguishable

2,605,       Within GAAP but  Earnings Management 
3,605,The next level down on the spectrum in Exhibit   is labeled  Within GAAP but  earnings management    The term   earnings management  is defined here as making intentional choices that create biased financial reports   The  distinction between earnings management and biased choices is subtle and primarily a matter of intent  Earnings  management represents  deliberate actions to influence reported earnings and their interpretation   Ronen and Yaari         Earnings can be  managed  upward  increased  by taking real actions such as deferring research and  development  R D  expenses into the next reporting period  Alternatively earnings can be increased by accounting choices such as changing accounting estimates  For example the amount of estimated product returns bad debt  expense or asset impairment could be decreased  Because it is difficult to determine intent we include earnings  management under the biased choices discussion 
4,605,     Departures from GAAP
5,605,The next levels down on the spectrum in Exhibit   mark departures from GAAP  Financial reporting that departs from  GAAP can generally be considered low quality  In such situations earnings quality is likely difficult or impossible to  assess because comparisons with earlier periods and or other entities cannot be made  An example of improper  accounting was Enron  accounting issues revealed in       whose inappropriate use of off balance sheet structures and  other complex transactions resulted in vastly understated indebtedness as well as overstated profits and operating cash  flow  Another notorious example of improper accounting was WorldCom  accounting issues discovered in       a  company that by improperly capitalizing certain expenditures dramatically understated its expenses and thus overstated  its profits  More recently New Century Financial  accounting issues revealed in       issued billions of dollars of  subprime mortgages and improperly reserved only minimal amounts for loan repurchase losses  Each of these  companies subsequently filed for bankruptcy 
6,605,In the     s Polly Peck International  PPI  reported currency losses incurred in the normal course of operations  directly through equity rather than in its profit and loss statements  In the     s Sunbeam improperly reported  revenues from  bill and hold  sales and also manipulated the timing of expenses in an effort to falsely portray  outstanding performance of its then new chief executive 
7,605,At the bottom of the quality spectrum fabricated reports portray fictitious events either to fraudulently obtain  investments by misrepresenting the company s performance and or to obscure fraudulent misappropriation of the  company s assets  Examples of fraudulent reporting are unfortunately easy to find although they were not necessarily  easy to identify at the time  In the     s Equity Funding Corp  created fictitious revenues and even fictitious  policyholders  In the     s Crazy Eddie s reported fictitious inventory as well as fictitious revenues supported by fake  invoices  In      Parmalat reported fictitious bank balances 
8,605,EXAMPLE  
9,605,Spectrum for Assessing Quality of Financial Reports
10,605,Jake Lake a financial analyst has identified several items in the financial reports of several  hypothetical   companies  Describe each of these items in the context of the financial reporting quality spectrum 
11,605,   ABC Co  s      earnings totaled      million including a      million gain from selling one of its less  profitable divisions  ABC s earnings for the prior three years totaled      million      million and       million  The company s financial reports are extremely clear and detailed and the company s earnings  announcement highlights the one time nature of the      million gain 
12,605,   DEF Co  discloses that in      it changed the depreciable life of its equipment from   years to    years   Equipment represents a substantial component of the company s assets  The company s disclosures  indicate that the change is permissible under the accounting standards of its jurisdiction but provide only  limited explanation of the change 
13,605,   GHI Co  s R D expenditures for the past five years have been approximately    of sales  In      the  company significantly reduced its R D expenditures  Without the reduction in R D expenditures the  company would have reported a loss  No explanation is disclosed

2,606,ABC s      total earnings quality can be viewed as low because nearly half of the earnings are derived from a  non sustainable activity namely the sale of a division  ABC s      quality of earnings from continuing  operations may be high because the amounts are fairly consistent from year to year although an analyst would  undertake further analysis to confirm earnings quality  In general a user of financial reports should look beyond  the bottom line net income  The description provided suggests that the company s reporting quality is high  the  reports are clear and detailed and the one time nature of the      million gain is highlighted 
3,606,Solution to   
4,606,DEF s accounting choice appears to be within permissible accounting standards but its effect is to substantially  lower depreciation expense and thus to increase earnings for the year  The quality of reported earnings is  questionable  Although the new level of earnings may be sustainable similar increases in earnings for future  periods might not be achievable because increasing earnings solely by changing accounting estimates is likely  not sustainable  In addition the description provided suggests that the company s reporting quality is low  because it offers only a limited explanation for the change 
5,606,Solution to   
6,606,GHI s operational choice to reduce its R D may reflect real earnings management because the change enabled  the company to avoid reporting a loss  In addition the description provided suggests that the company s  reporting quality is low because it does not offer an explanation for the change 
7,606,     Differentiate between Conservative and Aggressive Accounting
8,606,This section returns to the implications of conservative and aggressive accounting choices  As mentioned earlier  unbiased financial reporting is the ideal  But investors may prefer or be perceived to prefer conservative rather than  aggressive accounting choices because a positive surprise is acceptable  In contrast management may prefer or be  perceived to prefer aggressive accounting choices because they increase the company s reported performance and  financial position in the current period 
9,606,Aggressive accounting choices in the current period may decrease the company s reported performance and financial  position in later periods which creates a sustainability issue  Conservative choices do not typically create a  sustainability issue because they decrease the company s reported performance and financial position in the current  period and may increase its reported performance and financial position in later periods  In terms of establishing  expectations for the future however financial reporting that is relevant and faithfully representative is the most useful 
10,606,A common presumption is that financial reports are typically biased upward but that is not always the case  Although  accounting standards ideally promote unbiased financial reporting some accounting standards may specifically require  a conservative treatment of a transaction or an event  Also managers may choose to take a conservative approach when  applying standards  It is important that an analyst consider the possibility of conservative choices and their effects 
11,606,At its most extreme conservatism follows accounting practices that  anticipate no profit but anticipate all  losses   Bliss        But in general conservatism means that revenues may be recognized once a verifiable and legally  enforceable receivable has been generated and that losses need not be recognized until it becomes  probable  that an  actual loss will be incurred  Conservatism is not an absolute but is characterized by degrees such as  the accountant s  tendency to require a higher degree of verification to recognize good news as gains than to recognize bad news as  losses   Basu        From this perspective  verification   e g  physical existence of inventories evidence of costs  incurred or to be incurred or establishment of rights and obligations on legal grounds  drives the degree of  conservatism  For recognition of revenues a higher degree of verification would be required than for expenses 
12,606,       Conservatism in Accounting Standards
13,606,The Conceptual Framework supports neutrality of information   A neutral depiction is without bias in the selection or  presentation of financial information    Neutrality lack of upward or downward bias is considered a desirable  characteristic of financial reporting  Conservatism directly conflicts with the characteristic of neutrality because the  asymmetric nature of conservatism leads to bias in measuring assets and liabilities and ultimately earnings 
14,606,Despite efforts to support neutrality in financial reporting however many conservatively biased standards remain   These standards result in downward biased pictures of earnings and financial position within financial reports  Without  care this biased portrayal can result in biased estimates of future prospects developed using financial reports

2,607,Example   illustrates the issues posed by conservative accounting practices for analyzing financial reports of  companies engaged in the exploration and production of underground natural resources oil and gas coal precious  metals and so on 
3,607,EXAMPLE  
4,607,Accounting Conservatism in Extractive Industries
5,607,Exhibit   depicts the typical exploration and production operating cycle beginning with exploration activities  through realization of cash from customers and beyond to the payment of royalties from cash collections that  are often due to landowners and or host governments 
6,607,Exhibit    The Extractive Industries Production Cycle
7,607,Under both IFRS and US GAAP companies in the oil and gas industry recognize revenue after the product has  been shipped  In addition under both sets of standards companies may capitalize some acquisition exploration  and development costs but extraction costs are expensed as they are incurred  Thus extraction costs are  expensed during the period between discovery and the time of sale 
8,607,   Why is the revenue recognition accounting standard in the oil and gas industry characterized as  conservative 
9,607,   Why is the expense recognition accounting standard in the oil and gas industry characterized as  conservative 
10,607,Solution to   
11,607,The most significant  good news  events for an oil exploration and production company by far are discoveries  of oil and gas  reserves   Ironically one could not possibly know this critical fact from looking at the  company s reported earnings because conservative accounting standards delay recognition of sales revenue  until the energy resources are extracted a customer is identified and product is shipped  Conservative  accounting standards prohibit recognition of the first revenues from an oil and gas reserve until years after its  actual discovery

1,608,    yang lu  yolandalulu outlook com                                                 
2,608,Solution to   
3,608,Because extraction costs must be expensed rather than capitalized a company may report losses  or reduced  profits  during the periods between discovery and the first sales from an oil field even though the oil exists  with certainty and possesses saleable value 
4,608,The unavoidable conclusion is that conservatism which can now be characterized as a delay in the recognition in  profits from when they are actually created until a point at which they are subject to a sufficiently high level of  verification sometimes impairs the relevance of financial statements for external decision makers  In the particular  case of oil and gas exploration and production many jurisdictions require extensive supplemental disclosures about  operations which reduce the problem to a degree 
5,608,Standards across jurisdictions may differ on the extent of conservatism embedded within the standards  An analyst  should be aware of the implications of accounting standards on the financial reports 
6,608,An example is the different treatment by IFRS and US GAAP for the impairment of long lived assets    Both IFRS and  US GAAP specify an impairment analysis protocol that begins with an assessment of whether recent events indicate  that the economic benefit from an individual or group of long lived assets may be less than its carrying amount s    From that point on however the two regimes diverge 
7,608,  Under IFRS if the  recoverable amount   the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use  is less than  the carrying amount then an impairment charge will be recorded 
8,608,  Under US GAAP an impairment charge will be recorded only when the sum of the undiscounted future cash  flows expected to be derived from the asset s  is less than the carrying amount s   If the undiscounted future cash  flows are less than the carrying amount the asset is written down to fair value 
9,608,To illustrate the difference in application assume that a factory is the unit of account eligible for impairment testing  Its  carrying amount is             fair value  and  recoverable amount  are both           and the undiscounted  future net cash flows associated with the factory total            Under IFRS an impairment charge of           would be recorded  but under US GAAP no impairment charge would be recognized 
10,608,Thus on its face IFRS would be regarded as more conservative than US GAAP because impairment losses would  normally be recognized earlier under IFRS than under US GAAP  But taking the analysis one step further such a  broad generalization may not hold up  For example if an asset is impaired under both IFRS and US GAAP and the  asset s value in use exceeds its fair value the impairment loss under US GAAP will be greater  Also IFRS permits the  recognition of recoveries of the recoverable amount in subsequent periods if evidence indicates that the recoverable  amount has subsequently increased  In contrast US GAAP prohibits the subsequent write up of an asset after an  impairment charge has been taken  it would recognize the asset s increased value only when the asset is ultimately sold 
11,608,Other common examples of conservatism in accounting standards include the following 
12,608,  Research costs  Because the future benefit of research costs is uncertain at the time the costs are incurred both  US GAAP and IFRS require immediate expensing instead of capitalization 
13,608,  Litigation losses  When it becomes  probable  that a cost will be incurred both US GAAP and IFRS require  expense recognition even though a legal liability may not be incurred until a future date 
14,608,  Insurance recoverables  Generally a company that receives payment on an insurance claim may not recognize a  receivable until the insurance company acknowledges the validity of the claimed amount 
15,608,  Commodity inventories  Increases in the market prices of commodity inventories held may not be recognized  unless they are sold despite the fact that identifying a specific buyer is a relatively inconsequential activity from  an economic standpoint 
16,608,Watts        reviews empirical studies of conservatism and identifies four potential benefits of conservatism 
17,608,  Given asymmetrical information conservatism may protect the contracting parties with less information and  greater risk  This protection is necessary because the contracting party may be at a disadvantage  For example  corporations that access debt markets have limited liability and lenders thus have limited recourse to recover  their losses from shareholders  As another example executives who receive earnings based bonuses might not be  subject to having those bonuses  clawed back  if earnings are subsequently discovered to be overstated

2,609,  Conservatism reduces the possibility of litigation and by extension litigation costs  Rarely if ever is a company  sued because it understated good news or overstated bad news 
3,609,  Conservative rules may protect the interests of regulators and politicians by reducing the possibility that fault will  be found with them if companies overstate earnings or assets 
4,609,  In many tax jurisdictions financial and tax reporting rules are linked  For example in Germany and Japan only  deductions taken against reported income can be deducted against taxable income  Hence companies can reduce  the present value of their tax payments by electing conservative accounting policies for certain types of events 
5,609,Analysts should consider possible conservative and aggressive biases and their consequences when examining financial  reports  Current period financial reports may be unbiased upward biased through aggressive accounting choices  downward biased through conservative accounting choices or biased through a combination of conservative and  aggressive accounting choices 
6,609,       Bias in the Application of Accounting Standards
7,609,Any application of accounting standards whether the standard itself is neutral or not often requires significant amounts  of judgment  Characterizing the application of an accounting standard as conservative or aggressive is more a matter of  intent rather than definition 
8,609,Careful analysis of disclosures facts and circumstances contributes to making an accurate inference of intent   Management seeking to manipulate earnings may take a longer view by sacrificing short term profitability in order to  ensure higher profits in later periods  One example of biased accounting in the guise of conservatism is the so called   big bath  restructuring charges  Both US GAAP and IFRS provide for accrual of future costs associated with  restructurings and these costs are often associated with and presented along with asset impairments  But in some  instances companies use the accounting provisions to estimate  big  losses in the current period so that performance in  future periods will appear better  Having observed numerous instances of manipulative practices in the late     s in  which US companies set up opportunities to report higher profits in future periods that were not connected with  performance in those periods the SEC staff issued rules that narrowed the circumstances under which costs can be  categorized as part of a  non recurring  restructuring event and enhanced the transparency surrounding restructuring  charges and asset impairments   
9,609,A similar manifestation of  big bath  accounting is often referred to as  cookie jar reserve accounting   Both US  GAAP and IFRS require accruals of estimates of future non payments of loans  In his      speech  The  Numbers  Game   SEC chair Arthur Levitt expressed the general concern that corporations were overstating loans and other  forms of loss allowances for the purpose of smoothing income over time    In      the SEC issued interpretive  guidance that essentially requires a company to provide a separate section in management s discussion and analysis   MD A  titled  Critical Accounting Estimates     If the effects of subjective estimates and judgments of highly  uncertain matters are material to stakeholders  investors customers suppliers and other users of the financial  statements  disclosures of their nature and exposure to uncertainty should be made in the MD A  This requirement is  in addition to required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements 
10,609,   CONTEXT FOR ASSESSING FINANCIAL REPORTING  QUALITY
11,609,In assessing financial reporting quality it is useful to consider whether a company s managers may be motivated to  issue financial reports that are not high quality  If motivation exists an analyst should consider whether the reporting  environment is conducive to managers  misreporting  It is important to consider mechanisms within the reporting  environment that discipline financial reporting quality such as the regulatory regime 
12,609,     Motivations
13,609,Managers may be motivated to issue financial reports that are not high quality to mask poor performance such as loss  of market share or lower profitability than competitors  Lewis        stated  A firm experiencing performance  problems particularly those it considers transient may induce a response that inflates current earnings numbers in  exchange for lower future earnings  
14,609,http   e pub t pv dj zog   v q g  vbk OEBPS CFA     R      print

2,610,  Even when there is no need to mask poor performance managers frequently have incentives to meet or beat  market expectations as reflected in analysts  forecasts and or management s own forecasts  Exceeding forecasts  typically increases stock price if only temporarily  Additionally exceeding forecasts can increase management  compensation that is linked to increases in stock price or to reported earnings  Graham Harvey and Rajgopal         found that the CFOs they surveyed view earnings as the most important financial metric to financial  markets  Achieving  or exceeding  particular benchmarks including prior year earnings and analysts  forecasts  is very important  The authors examined a variety of motivations for why managers might  exercise accounting  discretion to achieve some desirable earnings goal   Motivations to meet earnings benchmarks include equity  market effects  for example building credibility with market participants and positively affecting stock price  and  trade effects  for example enhancing reputation with customers and suppliers   Equity market effects are the  most powerful incentives but trade effects are important particularly for smaller companies 
3,610,  Career concerns and incentive compensation may motivate accounting choices  For example managers might be  concerned that working for a company that performs poorly will limit their future career opportunities or that  they will not receive a bonus based on exceeding a particular earnings target  In both cases management might  be motivated to make accounting choices to increase earnings  In a period of marginally poor performance a  manager might accelerate or inflate revenues and or delay or under report expenses  Conversely in a period of  strong performance a manager might delay revenue recognition or accelerate expense recognition to increase the  probability of exceeding the next period s targets  i e  to  bank  some earnings for the next period   The  surveyed managers indicated a greater concern with career implications of reported results than with incentive  compensation implications 
4,610,Avoiding debt covenant violations can motivate managers to inflate earnings  Graham Harvey and Rajgopal s survey  indicates that avoidance of bond covenant violation is important to highly leveraged and unprofitable companies but  relatively unimportant overall 
5,610,     Conditions Conducive to Issuing Low Quality Financial Reports
6,610,As discussed deviations from a neutral presentation of financial results could be driven by management choices or by a  jurisdiction s financial reporting standards  Ultimately a decision to issue low quality or even fraudulent financial  reports is made by an individual or individuals  Why individuals make such choices is not always immediately  apparent  For example why would the newly appointed CEO of Sunbeam who already had a net worth of more than       million commit accounting fraud by improperly reporting revenues from  bill and hold  sales and manipulating  the timing of expenses rather than admit to lower than expected financial results 
7,610,Typically three conditions exist when low quality financial reports are issued  opportunity motivation and  rationalization  Opportunity can be the result of internal conditions such as poor internal controls or an ineffective  board of directors or external conditions such as accounting standards that provide scope for divergent choices or  minimal consequences for an inappropriate choice  Motivation can result from pressure to meet some criteria for  personal reasons such as a bonus or corporate reasons such as concern about financing in the future  Rationalization is  important because if an individual is concerned about a choice he or she needs to be able to justify it to him  or herself 
8,610,Former Enron CFO Andrew Fastow speaking at the      Association of Certified Fraud Examiners Annual Fraud  Conference indicated that he knew at the time he was doing something wrong but followed procedure to justify his  decision  Pavlo        He made sure to get management and board approval as well as legal and accounting opinions  and to include appropriate disclosures  The incentive and corporate culture was to create earnings rather than focus on  long term value  Clearly as reflected in his prison sentence he did something that was not only wrong but illegal 
9,610,     Mechanisms That Discipline Financial Reporting Quality
10,610,Markets potentially discipline financial reporting quality  Companies and nations compete for capital and the cost of  capital is a function of perceived risk including the risk that a company s financial statements will skew investors   expectations  Thus in the absence of other conflicting economic incentives a company seeking to minimize its long  term cost of capital should aim to provide high quality financial reports  In addition to markets other mechanisms that  discipline financial reporting quality include market regulatory authorities auditors and private contracts 
11,610,       Market Regulatory Authorities

2,611,Companies seeking to minimize the cost of capital should maximize reporting quality but as discussed earlier  conflicting incentives often exist  For this reason national regulations and the regulators that establish and enforce  rules can play a significant role in financial reporting quality  Many of the world s securities regulators are members of  the International Organization of Securities Commissions  IOSCO   IOSCO is recognized as the  global standard setter  for the securities sector  although it does not actually set standards but rather establishes objectives and principles to  guide securities and capital market regulation  IOSCO s membership includes more than     securities regulators and     other securities market participants such as stock exchanges   
3,611,One member of IOSCO is the European Securities and Markets Authority  ESMA    an independent EU authority  with a mission to  enhance the protection of investors and reinforce stable and well functioning financial markets in the  European Union     ESMA organizes financial reporting enforcement activities through a forum consisting of  European enforcers from European Economic Area countries  Direct supervision and enforcement activities are  performed at the national level  For example the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA  is the IOSCO member with  primary responsibility for securities regulation in the United Kingdom  ESMA reported that European enforcers  performed     full and      partial reviews of companies  accounts in      which in turn led to enforcement actions  with the following outcomes     amended reports to restate financial statements approximately     public corrective  notes or announcements and approximately     required corrections in future financial statements   
4,611,Another member of IOSCO is the US regulatory authority the Securities and Exchange Commission  The SEC is  responsible for overseeing approximately      US public companies  along with investment advisers broker dealers  securities exchanges and other entities  and reviews the disclosures of these companies at least once every three years  with the aim of improving information available to investors and potentially uncovering possible violations of securities  laws    In      the SEC reported that it had filed     enforcement actions for financial reporting and disclosure  violations during the preceding five year period  along with around      other types of enforcement actions  in which      of the named parties were charged with fraud   
5,611,Examples of regulatory bodies in Asia include the Financial Services Agency in Japan the China Securities Regulatory  Commission and the Securities and Exchange Board of India  Examples of regulatory bodies in South America include  the Comisi n Nacional de Valores in Argentina Comiss o de Valores Mobili rios in Brazil and Superintendencia de  Valores y Seguros in Chile  A full list of IOSCO members can be found on the organization s website 
6,611,Typical features of a regulatory regime that most directly affect financial reporting quality include the following 
7,611,  Registration requirements  Market regulators typically require publicly traded companies to register securities  before offering the securities for sale to the public  A registration document typically contains current financial  statements other relevant information about the risks and prospects of the company issuing the securities and  information about the securities being offered 
8,611,  Disclosure requirements  Market regulators typically require publicly traded companies to make public periodic  reports including financial reports and management comments  Standard setting bodies such as the IASB and  FASB are typically private sector self regulated organizations with board members who are experienced  accountants auditors users of financial statements and academics  Regulatory authorities such as the  Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority in Singapore the Securities and Exchange Commission in the  United States the Securities and Exchange Commission in Brazil and the Financial Reporting Council in the  United Kingdom have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting requirements and exert other controls  over entities that participate in the capital markets within their jurisdiction  In other words generally standard  setting bodies set the standards and regulatory authorities recognize and enforce those standards  Without the  recognition of standards by regulatory authorities the private sector standard setting bodies would have no  authority  Regulators often retain the legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction  and can overrule the private sector standard setting bodies 
9,611,  Auditing requirements  Market regulators typically require companies  financial statements to be accompanied by  an audit opinion attesting that the financial statements conform to the relevant set of accounting standards  Some  regulators such as the SEC in the United States require an additional audit opinion attesting to the effectiveness  of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
10,611,  Management commentaries  Regulations typically require publicly traded companies  financial reports to include  statements by management  For example the FCA in the United Kingdom requires a management report  containing      a fair review of the issuer s business  and     a description of the principal risks and uncertainties  facing the issuer

2,612,  Responsibility statements  Regulations typically require a statement from the person or persons responsible for  the company s filings  Such statements require the responsible individuals to explicitly acknowledge  responsibility and to attest to the correctness of the financial reports  Some regulators such as the SEC in the  United States require formal certifications that carry specific legal penalties for false certifications 
3,612,  Regulatory review of filings  Regulators typically undertake a review process to ensure that the rules have been  followed  The review process typically covers all initial registrations and a sample of subsequent periodic  financial reports 
4,612,  Enforcement mechanisms  Regulators are granted various powers to enforce the securities market rules  Such  powers can include assessing fines suspending or permanently barring market participants and bringing criminal  prosecutions  Public announcements of disciplinary actions are also a type of enforcement mechanism 
5,612,In summary market regulatory authorities play a central role in encouraging high quality financial reporting 
6,612,       Auditors
7,612,As noted regulatory authorities typically require that publicly traded companies  financial statements be audited by an  independent auditor  Private companies also obtain audit opinions for their financial statements either voluntarily or  because audit reports are required by an outside party such as providers of debt or equity capital 
8,612,Audit opinions provide financial statement users with some assurance that the information complies with the relevant  set of accounting standards and presents the company s information fairly  Exhibits     and   provide excerpts from  the independent auditors  reports for GlaxoSmithKline plc Novartis Group and the Nestl  Group respectively  Note  that for each company the auditor issued an unqualified or clean opinion that reflects the specific requirements of the  company s regulatory regime  For example the audit opinions for Novartis include an SEC required opinion on the  effectiveness of internal controls because Novartis  securities trade in the United States  The SEC permits non US  companies to report using US GAAP IFRS as issued by the IASB or home country GAAP  If a company reports using  home country GAAP a reconciliation to US GAAP must be provided  Regardless of the standards used by a non US  company in preparing its financial statements an opinion on internal controls  effectiveness is required

6,613,Although audit opinions provide discipline for financial reporting quality inherent limitations exist  First an audit  opinion is based on a review of information prepared by the company  If a company deliberately intends to deceive its  auditor a review of information might not uncover misstatements  Second an audit is based on sampling and the  sample might not reveal misstatements  Third an  expectations gap  may exist between the auditor s role and the  public s expectation of auditors  An audit is not typically intended to detect fraud  it is intended to provide assurance  that the financial reports are fairly presented  Finally the company being audited pays the audit fees often established  through a competitive process  This situation could provide an auditor with an incentive to show leniency to the  company being audited particularly if the auditor s firm provides additional services to the company 
7,613,       Private Contracting
8,613,Aspects of private contracts such as loan agreements or investment contracts can serve as mechanisms to discipline  financial reporting quality  Many parties that have a contractual arrangement with a company have an incentive to  monitor that company s performance and to ensure that the company s financial reports are high quality  For example  loan agreements often contain loan covenants which create specifically tailored financial reporting requirements that  are legally binding for the issuer  As noted earlier avoidance of debt covenant violation is a potential motivation for  managers to inflate earnings  As another example an investment contract could contain provisions giving investors the  option to recover all or part of their investment if certain financial triggers occur  Such provisions could motivate the  investee s managers to manipulate reported results to avoid the financial triggers 
9,613,Because the financial reports prepared by the investees or borrowers directly affect the contractual  outcomes potentially creating a motivation for misreporting investors and lenders are motivated to monitor financial  reports and to ensure that they are high quality 
10,613,EXAMPLE  
11,613,Financial Reporting Manipulation  Motivations and  Disciplining Mechanisms
12,613,For each of the following two scenarios identify     factors that might motivate the company s managers to  manipulate reported financial amounts and     applicable mechanisms that could discipline financial reporting  quality

2,614,   DEF Co  is a publicly traded company  For the most recent quarter the average of analysts  forecasts for  earnings per share was        In its quarterly earnings announcement DEF reported net income of            The number of common shares outstanding was          DEF s main product is a  hardware device that includes a free two year service contract in the selling price  Based on management  estimates the company allocates a portion of revenues to the hardware device which it recognizes  immediately and a portion to the service contract which it defers and recognizes over the two years of  the contract  Based on the disclosures a higher percentage of revenue was allocated to hardware than in  the past with an estimated after tax impact on net income of        
3,614,Solution to   
4,614,The need to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of     might motivate ABC s managers to manipulate  reported financial amounts  The company s coverage ratio based on the reported amounts is exactly equal to       If ABC s managers had not changed the estimated useful life of the property plant and equipment the  coverage ratio would have fallen below the required level

2,615,   DETECTION OF FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY ISSUES
3,615,Choices in the application of accounting standards abound which is perhaps one reason why accounting literature and  texts are so voluminous  Compounding the complexity measurement often depends on estimates of economic  phenomena  Two estimates might be justifiable but they may have significantly different effects on the company s  financial statements  As discussed earlier the choice of a particular estimate may depend on the motivations of the  reporting company s managers  With many choices available and the inherent flexibility of estimates in the accounting  process managers have many tools for managing and meeting analysts  expectations through financial reporting 
4,615,An understanding of the choices that companies make in financial reporting is fundamental to evaluating the overall  quality both financial reporting and earnings quality of the reports produced  Choices exist both in how information  is presented  financial reporting quality  and in how financial results are calculated  earnings quality   Choices in  presentation  financial reporting quality  may be fairly transparent to investors  Choices in the calculation of financial  results  earnings quality  however are more difficult to discern because they can be deeply embedded in the  construction of reported financial results 
5,615,The availability of accounting choices enables managers to affect the reporting of financial results  Some choices  increase performance and financial position in the current period  aggressive choices  and others increase them in later  periods  conservative choices   A manager that wants to increase performance and financial position in the current  period could 
6,615,  Recognize revenue prematurely 
7,615,  Use nonrecurring transactions to increase profits 
8,615,  Defer expenses to later periods 
9,615,  Measure and report assets at higher values  and or
10,615,  Measure and report liabilities at lower values 
11,615,A manager that wants to increase performance and financial position in a later period could 
12,615,  Defer current income to a later period  save income for a  rainy day    and or
13,615,  Recognize future expenses in a current period setting the table for improving future performance 
14,615,The following sections describe some of the potential choices for how information is presented and how accounting  elements  assets liabilities owners  equity revenue and gains  income  and expenses and losses  are recognized  measured and reported  In addition to choices within GAAP companies may prepare fraudulent reports  For example  these reports may include non existent revenue or assets  Section   concludes with some of the warning signs that can  indicate poor quality financial reports 
15,615,     Presentation Choices
16,615,The technology boom of the     s and the internet bubble of the early     s featured companies popular with  investors that often shared the same characteristic  They could not generate enough current earnings to justify their  stock prices using the traditional price to earnings ratio  P E  approaches to valuation  Many investors chose to explain  these apparent anomalies by rationalizing that the old focus on profits and traditional valuation approaches no longer  applied to such companies  Strange new metrics for determining operating performance emerged  Website operators  spoke of the  eyeballs  they had captured in a quarter or the  stickiness  of their websites for web surfers  visits   Various versions of  pro forma earnings  that is  non GAAP earnings measures  became a financial reporting  staple of the era

2,616,Many technology companies were accomplished practitioners of pro forma reporting but they were not the first to use  it  In the early     s downsizing of large companies was a commonplace event and massive restructuring charges  obscured the operating performance at many established companies  For example as it learned to cope in a world that  embraced the personal computer rather than mainframe computing International Business Machines  IBM  reported  massive restructuring charges in           and            billion       billion and      billion respectively  IBM  was not alone  Sears incurred      billion of restructuring charges in      and AT T reported restructuring charges of       billion in       These events were not isolated  restructuring charges were a standard quarterly reporting event  To  counter perceptions that their operations were floundering and supposedly to assist investors in evaluating operating  performance companies often sanitized earnings releases by excluding restructuring charges in pro forma measures of  financial performance 
3,616,Accounting principles for reporting business combinations also played a role in boosting the popularity of pro forma  earnings  Before      acquisitions of one company by another often resulted in goodwill amortization charges that  made subsequent earnings reports look weak  Complicating matters there were two accounting methods for recording  acquisitions  pooling of interests and purchase methods  The now extinct pooling of interests treatment was difficult  for companies to achieve because of the many restrictive criteria for its use but it was greatly desired because it did not  result in goodwill amortization charges  In the technology boom period acquisitions were common and many were  reported as purchases with consequential goodwill amortization dragging down earnings for as long as    years under  the then existing rules  Acquisitive companies reporting under purchase accounting standards perceived themselves to  be at a reporting disadvantage compared with companies able to apply pooling of interests accounting  The companies  reporting under purchase accounting began to present earnings adjusted for the exclusion of amortization of intangible  assets and goodwill 
4,616,Because investors try to make intercompany comparisons on a consistent basis earnings before interest taxes  depreciation and amortization has become an extremely popular performance measure  EBITDA is widely viewed as  eliminating noisy reporting signals  That noise may be introduced by different accounting methods among companies  for depreciation amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges  Companies may construct and report their  own version of EBITDA sometimes referring to it as  adjusted EBITDA  by adding to the list of items to exclude  from net income  Items that analysts might encounter include the following 
5,616,  Rental payments for operating leases resulting in EBITDAR  earnings before interest taxes depreciation  amortization and rentals  
6,616,  Equity based compensation usually justified on the grounds that it is a non cash expense 
7,616,  Acquisition related charges 
8,616,  Impairment charges for goodwill or other intangible assets 
9,616,  Impairment charges for long lived assets 
10,616,  Litigation costs  and
11,616,  Loss gain on debt extinguishments 
12,616,Among other incentives for the spread of non GAAP earnings measures are loan covenants  Lenders may make  demands on a borrowing company that require achieving and maintaining performance criteria defined by using GAAP  net income as a starting point but arriving at a measure suitable to the lender  The company may use this measure as its  preferred non GAAP metric in earnings releases and it also may use the measure in describing its liquidity or solvency  situation in the management commentary  called management discussion and analysis in the United States  
13,616,As mentioned earlier if a company uses a non GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing it must display the most  directly comparable GAAP measure with equal prominence and provide a reconciliation of the non GAAP measure and  the equivalent GAAP measure  Management must explain why it believes that the non GAAP financial measure  provides useful information regarding the company s financial condition and operations  Management must also  disclose additional purposes if material for which it uses the non GAAP financial measures 
14,616,Similarly IFRS requires a definition and explanation of any non IFRS measures included in financial reports including  why the measure is potentially relevant to users of the financial reports  Management must provide reconciliations of  non IFRS measures with IFRS measures presented in the financial reports  There seems to be a general concern that  management may use non GAAP measures to distract a user s attention from GAAP measures 
15,616,The SEC intended that the definition of non GAAP financial measure capture all measures that have the effect of  depicting either

2,617,  a measure of performance that differs from that presented in the financial statements such as income or loss  before taxes or net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP  or
3,617,  a measure of liquidity that differs from cash flow or cash flow from operations computed in accordance with  GAAP   
4,617,The SEC prohibits the exclusion of charges or liabilities requiring cash settlement from any non GAAP liquidity  measures other than EBIT and EBITDA  Also prohibited is the calculation of a non GAAP performance measure  intended to eliminate or smooth items tagged as non recurring infrequent or unusual when such items are very likely  to occur again  The SEC views the period within two years of either before or after the reporting date as the relevant  time frame for considering whether a charge or gain is a recurring item  Example   describes a case of misuse and  misreporting of non GAAP measures

6,617,Misuse and Misreporting of Non GAAP Measures
7,617,Groupon is an online discount merchant  In the company s initial S   registration statement in      then CEO  Andrew Mason gave prospective investors an up front warning in a section entitled  We don t measure  ourselves in conventional ways   He described Groupon s adjusted consolidated segment operating income   adjusted CSOI  measure  Exhibit    provides excerpts from a section entitled  Non GAAP Financial  Measures  which offered a more detailed explanation of the measure  Exhibit    also from the initial  registration statement shows a reconciliation of CSOI to the most comparable US GAAP measure  In its  review the SEC took the position that online marketing expenses were a recurring cost of business  Groupon  responded that the marketing costs were similar to acquisition costs not recurring costs and that  we ll ramp  down marketing just as fast as we ramped it up reducing the customer acquisition part of our marketing  expenses  as time passes

10,617,Disclosures from June S   Filing
11,617,Adjusted CSOI is operating income of our two segments North America and International adjusted  for online marketing expense acquisition related costs and stock based compensation expense  Online  marketing expense primarily represents the cost to acquire new subscribers and is dictated by the  amount of growth we wish to pursue  Acquisition related costs are non recurring non cash items  related to certain of our acquisitions  Stock based compensation expense is a non cash item  We  consider Adjusted CSOI to be an important measure of the performance of our business as it excludes  expenses that are non cash or otherwise not indicative of future operating expenses  We believe it is  important to view Adjusted CSOI as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of  operations 
12,617,Our use of Adjusted CSOI has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider this  measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP  Some of  these limitations are 
13,617,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect the significant cash investments that we currently are making to  acquire new subscribers 
14,617,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of issuing equity based  compensation to our management team and employees or in connection with acquisitions 
15,617,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to  service interest or principal payments on any indebtedness that we may incur 
16,617,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any foreign exchange gains and losses

2,618,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect any tax payments that we might make which would represent a  reduction in cash available to us 
3,618,  Adjusted CSOI does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs   and
4,618,  Other companies including companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted CSOI  differently or may use other financial measures to evaluate their profitability which reduces the  usefulness of it as a comparative measure 
5,618,Because of these limitations Adjusted CSOI should not be considered as a measure of discretionary  cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business  When evaluating our performance you  should consider Adjusted CSOI alongside other financial performance measures including various  cash flow metrics net loss and our other GAAP results

14,619,   What cautions did Groupon include along with its description of the  Adjusted CSOI  metric 
15,619,   Groupon excludes  online marketing  from  Adjusted CSOI   How does the exclusion of this expense  compare with the SEC s limits on non GAAP performance measures 
16,619,   In the first quarter of      what was the effect of excluding online marketing expenses on the calculation  of  Adjusted CSOI  
17,619,   For      how did results under the revised non GAAP metric compare with the originally reported  metric 
18,619,Solution to   
19,619,Groupon cautioned that the  Adjusted CSOI  metric should not be considered in isolation should not be  considered as a substitute for analysis using GAAP results and  should not be considered a measure of  discretionary cash flow   The company lists numerous limitations primarily citing items that adjusted CSOI did  not reflect 
20,619,Solution to   
21,619,The SEC specifies that non GAAP measures should not eliminate items tagged as non recurring infrequent or  unusual when such items may be very likely to occur again  Because the online marketing expense occurred in  every period reported and is likely to occur again exclusion of this item appears contrary to SEC requirements 
22,619,Solution to   
23,619,As shown in Exhibit    in the first quarter of      the exclusion of the online marketing expense was enough  to swing the company from a net loss under US GAAP reporting to a profit at least a profit as defined by  adjusted CSOI  Using adjusted CSOI as a performance measure the company showed results that were      higher for the first quarter of      compared with the entire previous year 
24,619,Solution to   
25,619,As shown in Exhibit    the revised metric is now called  CSOI  and no longer refers to  Adjusted CSOI   For       results under the revised non GAAP metric which includes online marketing costs shows a loss of             instead of a profit of

2,620,     Accounting Choices and Estimates
3,620,Choices do not necessarily involve complex accounting standards  Something as simple as the shipping terms for goods  delivered to customers can have a profound effect on the timing of revenue  On the last day of the first quarter suppose  a company ships        of goods to a customer on the terms  free on board  FOB  shipping point  arriving the next  day  This shipping term means that the customer takes title to the goods and bears the risk of loss at the time the goods  leave the seller s loading dock  Barring any issues with collectability of the receivable or a likelihood of a return the  seller would be able to recognize revenue on the sale along with the associated profit  That revenue and profit would be  recognized in the first quarter of the year  Change the point at which the goods  title transfers to the customer to  FOB  destination  and the revenue pattern will be completely different  Under these terms the title and risk of  loss transfers to the customer when the goods arrive at their destination which is the customer s address  The seller  cannot recognize the sale and profit until the shipment arrives the following day which is the start of a new accounting  period 
4,620,A simple change in shipping terms can make the difference between revenue and profits in the current period or  postponing them until the next period  Shipping terms can also influence management behavior  To  make the  numbers  managers might push product out the door prematurely under FOB shipping point arrangements in order to  reflect as much revenue as possible in the current period  Alternatively in the case of an overabundance of orders the  company could run the risk of exceeding analysts  consensus estimates by a large margin  Management might be  uncomfortable with this situation because investors might extrapolate too much from one reporting period in which  expectations were exceeded  Management might want to prevent investors from becoming too optimistic and if  possible delay revenue recognition until the next quarter  This result could be accomplished by fulfilling customer  orders by initiating delivery on the last day of the quarter with shipping terms set as FOB destination  By doing so title  would transfer in the next accounting period  Another possibility in this scenario is that if the customers insisted on  FOB shipping point terms the selling company could simply delay shipment until after the close of the quarter 
5,620,This illustration also highlights a difficult distinction for investors to make  A company may use accounting as a tool to  aggressively promote earnings growth as in the example with the premature shipment of goods with FOB shipping  point terms but it may be aggressively managing the business flow by slacking off on shipping goods when business  is  too good  as in the second example  In either case a desired management outcome is obtained by a simple change  in shipping terms  Yet many investors might be inclined to say that the second example is a conservative kind of  earnings management and accept it even though it artificially masks the actual economic activity that occurred at the  time 
6,620,       How Accounting Choices and Estimates Affect Earnings and Balance Sheets
7,620,Assumptions about inventory cost flows provide another example of how accounting choices can affect financial  reporting  Companies may assume that their purchases of inventory items are sold to customers on a first in first out   FIFO  basis with the result that the remaining inventory reflects the most recent costs  Alternatively they may assume  that their purchases of inventory items are sold to customers on a weighted average cost basis  Example   makes the  point that merely choosing a cost flow assumption can affect profitability 
8,620,EXAMPLE  
9,620,Effect of Cost Flow Assumption
10,620,A company starts operations with no inventory at the beginning of a fiscal year and makes purchases of a good  for resale five times during the period at increasing prices  Each purchase is for the same number of units of the  good  The purchases and the cost of goods available for sale appear in the following table  Notice that the price  per unit has increased by      by the end of the period

12,620,Units Price Cost

2,621,During the period the company sells at      each all of the goods purchased except for five of them  Although  the ending inventory consists of five units the cost attached to those units can vary greatly 
3,621,   What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the FIFO method of inventory  costing 
4,621,   What are the ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the weighted average method  of inventory costing 
5,621,   Compare cost of goods sold and gross profit calculated under the two methods 
6,621,Solution to   
7,621,The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the FIFO method of inventory costing are        and       
8,621,Solution to   
9,621,The ending inventory and cost of goods sold if the company uses the weighted average method of inventory  costing are      and       
10,621,Solution to   
11,621,The following table shows how the choice of inventory costing methods FIFO versus weighted  average affects the cost of goods sold and gross profit 
12,621,Cost Flow Assumption Cost of goods available for sale Ending inventory    units  Cost of goods sold
13,621,Sales Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross profit margin
14,621,FIFO                   
15,621,                      
16,621,Weighted Average                  
17,621,                      
18,621,Note  Average inventory cost is calculated as Cost of goods available for sale Units purchased                    There are five  units in ending inventory yielding an inventory value of      
19,621,Depending on which cost flow assumption the company uses the end of period inventory is either       under  the weighted average method  or        under FIFO   The choice of method results in a difference of      in  gross profit and      in gross profit margin 
20,621,The previous example is simplified and extreme for purposes of illustration clarity but the point is important   Management s choice among acceptable inventory assumptions and methods affects profit  The selection of an  inventory costing method is a policy decision and companies cannot arbitrarily switch from one method to another at  random  The selection does matter to profitability however and it also matters to the balance sheet 
21,621,In periods of changing prices the FIFO cost assumption will provide a more current picture of ending inventory value  because the most recent purchases will remain in inventory  The balance sheet will be more relevant to investors  Under  the weighted average cost assumption however the balance sheet will display a blend of old and new costs  During  inflationary periods the value of the inventory will be understated  The company will not be able to replenish its  inventory at the value shown  At the same time the weighted average inventory cost method ensures that the more  current costs are shown in cost of sales making the income statement more relevant than under the FIFO assumption   Trade offs exist and investors should be aware of how accounting choices affect financial reports  High quality  financial reporting provides users sufficient information to assess the effects of accounting choices

2,622,Estimates abound in financial reporting because of the use of accrual accounting which attempts to show the effects of  all economic events on a company during a particular period  Accrual accounting stands in contrast to cash basis  accounting which shows only the cash transactions conducted by a company  Although a high degree of certainty  exists with reporting only cash transactions much information is hidden  For instance a company with growing  revenues that makes the majority of its sales on credit would be understating its revenues for each period if it reported  only cash transactions  On an accrual basis revenues reflect all transactions that occurred whether they transacted on a  cash basis or credit extended basis  Estimates enter the process because some facts related to events occurring in a  particular period might not yet be known  Estimates can be well grounded in reality and applied to present a complete  picture of the events affecting a company or they can be management tools for achieving a desired financial picture 
3,622,To illustrate how estimates affect financial reporting consider revenues that include credit sales  A company sells           of merchandise on credit and records the sale just before year end  Under accrual accounting that amount is  included in revenues and accounts receivable  The company s managers know from experience that they will never  collect every dollar of the accounts receivable  Past experience is that on average only     of accounts receivable is  collected  The company would estimate an amount of the uncollectible accounts at the time the sales occur and record  an uncollectible accounts expense of        lowering earnings  The other side of the entry would be to establish an  allowance for uncollectible accounts of         This allowance would be a contra asset account presented as an offset  to accounts receivable  The accounts receivable net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts would be stated at          which is the amount of cash the company ultimately expects to receive  If cash basis accounting had been  used no revenues or accounts receivable would have been reported even though sales of merchandise had occurred   Accrual accounting which contains estimates about future events provides a much fuller picture of what transpired in  the period than pure cash basis accounting 
4,622,Yet accrual accounting poses temptations to managers to manage the numbers rather than to manage the business   Suppose a company s managers realize that the company will not meet analysts  consensus estimates in a particular  quarter and further their bonus pay is dependent on reaching specified earnings targets  By offering special payment  terms or discounts the managers may induce customers to take delivery of products that they would normally not order  so they could ship the products on FOB shipping point terms and recognize the revenues in the current quarter  They  could even be so bold as to ship the goods under those terms even if the customer did not order them in hopes that the  customer would keep them or at worst return them in the next accounting period  Their focus would be to move the  product off the company s property with FOB shipping point terms 
5,622,To further improve earnings in order to meet the consensus estimates the company s managers might revise their  estimate of the uncollectible accounts  The company s collection history shows a typical non collection rate of    of  sales but the managers might rationalize the use of a    non collection rate  This change will reduce the allowance for  uncollectible accounts and uncollectible accounts expense reported for the period  The managers might be able to  justify the reduction on the grounds that the sales occurred in a part of the country that was experiencing an improved  economic outlook or that the company s collection history had been biased by the inclusion of a prolonged period of  economic downturn  Whatever the justification it would be hard to prove that the new estimate is completely right or  wrong until time has passed  Because proof of the reliability of estimates is rarely available at the time the estimate is  recorded managers have a readily available means for manipulating earnings at their discretion 
6,622,ConAgra Foods Inc  provides an example of how the allowance for uncollectible accounts may be manipulated in order  to manage earnings    A subsidiary of ConAgra Foods called United Agri Products  UAP  engaged in several  improper accounting practices one of them being the understatement of uncollectible accounts expense for several  years  Exhibit    presents an excerpt from the SEC s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release 
7,622,Exhibit     SEC s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding United Agri Products
8,622,  Generally UAP s policy required that accounts which were past due between    days and one year should  be reserved at     and accounts over one year past due were to be reserved at      
9,622,  In FY      and continuing through FY      UAP had substantial bad debt problems  In FY      certain  former UAP senior executives were informed that UAP needed to record an additional     million of bad  debt expense  Certain former UAP senior executives were aware that in FY      the size of the bad debt at  certain IOCs had been substantial enough that it could have negatively impacted those IOC s ability to  achieve PBT  profits before taxes  targets  In addition just prior to the end of UAP s FY      the Former  UAP COO  chief operating officer  in the presence of other UAP employees ordered that UAP s bad debt  reserve be reduced by    million in order to assist the Company in meeting its PBT target for the fiscal year

2,623,  At the end of FY      former UAP senior executives reported financial results to ConAgra which they  knew or were reckless in not knowing overstated UAP s income before income taxes because UAP had  failed to record sufficient bad debt expense  The misconduct with respect to bad debt expense caused  ConAgra to overstate its reported income before income taxes by    million or       in FY       At the  Agricultural Products  segment level the misconduct caused that segment s reported operating profit to be  overstated by       
3,623,Deferred tax assets provide another example of choices in estimates that are very similar to the ones encountered in  accrual accounting for credit sales  Deferred tax assets may arise when a company reports a net operating loss under tax  accounting rules  A company may record a deferred tax asset based on the expectation that current net tax operating  losses will offset expected future profits and reduce the company s future income tax liability  Accounting standards  require that the deferred tax asset be reduced by a  valuation allowance  to account for the possibility that the company  will be unable to generate enough profit to use all of the available tax benefits   
4,623,Assume a company loses    billion in      generating a net operating loss of the same amount for tax purposes  The  company s income tax rate is     and it will be able to apply the net operating loss to its taxable income for the next     years  The net operating loss results in a deferred tax asset with a nominal value of      million                       Initial recognition would result in a deferred tax asset of      million and a credit to deferred tax  expense of      million  The company must address the question of whether or not the      million will ever be  completely applied to future income  It may be experiencing increased competition and other circumstances that  resulted in the    billion loss and it may be unreasonable to assume that the company will have taxable income against  which to apply the loss  In fact the company s managers might believe it is reasonable to assume only that it will  survive for five years and with marginal profitability  The      million deferred tax asset is thus overstated if no  valuation allowance is recorded to offset it 
5,623,The managers believe that only      million of the net operating losses will actually be applied to the company s  taxable income  That belief implies that only     million of the tax benefits will ever be realized  The deferred tax  assets reported on the balance sheet should not exceed this amount  The company should record a valuation allowance  of      million which would offset the deferred tax asset balance of      million resulting in a net deferred tax asset  balance of     million  There would also be a      million credit to the deferred tax provision  It is important to  understand that the valuation allowance should be revised whenever facts and circumstances change 
6,623,The ultimate value of the deferred tax asset is driven by management s outlook for the future and that outlook may be  influenced by other factors  If the company needs to stay in compliance with debt covenants and needs every euro of  value that can be justified by the outlook its managers may take a more optimistic view of the future and keep the  valuation allowance artificially low  in other words the net deferred tax asset high  
7,623,PowerLinx Inc  provides an example of how over optimism about the realizability of a deferred tax asset can lead to  misstated financial reports  PowerLinx was a maker of security video cameras underwater cameras and accessories   Aside from fraudulently reporting     of its fiscal year      revenue PowerLinx had problems with valuation of its  deferred tax assets  Exhibit    provides an excerpt from the SEC s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release with  emphasis added   
8,623,Exhibit     SEC s Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release Regarding PowerLinx
9,623,PowerLinx improperly recorded on its fiscal year      balance sheet a deferred tax asset of           without any valuation allowance  The tax asset was material representing almost forty percent of  PowerLinx s total assets of           PowerLinx also recorded deferred tax assets of                 and        respectively in its financial statements for the first three quarters of      
10,623,PowerLinx did not have a proper basis for recording the deferred tax assets  The company had accumulated  significant losses in      and had no historical operating basis from which to conclude that it would be  profitable in future years  Underwater camera sales had declined significantly and the company had devoted  most of its resources to developing its SecureView product  The sole basis for PowerLinx s  expectation  of  future profitability was the purported    million backlog of SecureView orders which management assumed  would generate taxable income  however this purported backlog which predated Bauer s hiring did not  reflect actual demand for SecureView cameras and consequently was not a reasonable or reliable indicator  of future profitability

2,624,Another example of how choices and estimates can affect balance sheets is in the area of selecting a depreciation  method for allocating the cost of long lived assets to accounting periods subsequent to their acquisition  A company s  managers may choose to depreciate long lived assets     on a straight line basis with each year bearing the same  amount of depreciation expense      using an accelerated method with greater depreciation expense recognition in the  earlier part of an asset s life  or     using an activity based depreciation method which allocates depreciation expense  based on units of use or production  Depreciation expense is affected by another set of choices and estimates regarding  the salvage value of the assets being depreciated  A salvage value of zero will always increase depreciation expense  under any method compared with the choice of a non zero salvage value 
3,624,Assume a company invests          in manufacturing equipment and expects it to have a useful economic life of     years  During its expected life the equipment will produce        units of product or       depreciation expense per  unit produced  When it is disposed of at the end of its expected life the company s managers expect to realize no value  for the equipment  The following table shows the differences in three alternative methods of depreciation  straight line  accelerated on a double declining balance basis and units of production method with no salvage value assumed at the  end of the equipment s life

14,624,  Declining balance rate of     calculated as    year life being equivalent to     annual depreciation rate multiplied by         
15,624,The straight line method allocates the cost of the equipment evenly to all    years of the equipment s life  The double  declining balance method will have a higher allocation of cost to the earlier years of the equipment s life and as its  name implies the depreciation expense will decline in each succeeding year because it is based on a fixed rate applied  to a declining balance  The rate used was double the straight line rate but it could have been any other rate that the  company s managers believed was representative of the way the actual equipment depreciation occurred  Notice that  the double declining balance method also results in an incomplete depreciation of the machine at the end of    years  a  balance of                                remains at the end of the expected life which will result in a loss upon  the retirement of the equipment if the company s expectation of zero salvage value turns out to be correct  Some  companies may choose to depreciate the equipment to its expected salvage zero in this case in its final year of use   Some companies may use a policy of switching to straight line depreciation after the mid life of its depreciable assets  in order to fully depreciate them  That particular pattern is coincidentally displayed in the units of production example  in which the equipment is used most heavily in the earliest part of its useful life and then levels off to much less  utilization in the second half of the expected life 
16,624,Exhibit    shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over the same life  Each will affect earnings  differently

2,625,The company s managers could justify any one of these methods  Each might fairly represent the way the equipment  will be consumed over its expected economic life which is a subjective estimate itself  The choices of methods and  lives can profoundly affect reported income  These choices are not proven right or wrong until far into the future but  managers must estimate their effects in the present 
3,625,Exhibit    shows the effects of the three different methods on operating profit and operating profit margins assuming  that the production output of the equipment generates revenues of         each year and         of cash operating  expenses are incurred leaving         of operating profit before depreciation expense

6,626,The example above shows the differences among several alternative methods but even more depreciation expense  variation is possible by changing estimated lives and assumptions about salvage value  For instance change the  expected life assumption to   years from    and add an expectation that the equipment will have a     salvage value at  the end of its expected life  Exhibit    shows the revised depreciation calculations  Notice that under the double  declining balance method the depreciation rate is applied to the gross cost unlike the other two methods  The straight  line method and the units of production method subtract the salvage value from the cost before depreciation expense is  calculated  Also note that the assumption about the usage of the equipment is revised so that it is depreciated only to its  salvage value of         by the end of its estimated life  The total depreciation under each method is

2,627,Exhibit    shows the different expense allocation patterns of the methods over the five year expected life and assuming  a     salvage value  Although each method is distinctly different in the timing of the cost allocation over time the  variation is less pronounced than over the longer life used in the previous example 
3,627,Exhibit     Expense Allocation Patterns of Depreciation Methods in Changed Scenario
4,627,Perhaps one of the clearest examples of how choices affect both the balance sheet and income statement can be found  in the area of capitalization practices  In classifying a payment made management must determine whether the  payment will benefit only the current period making it an expense or whether it will benefit future periods leading  to classification as a cost to be capitalized as an asset  This management judgment embodies an implicit forecast of how  the item acquired by the payment will be used or not used in the future 
5,627,That judgment can be biased by the powerful effect a capitalization policy can have on current earnings  Every amount  capitalized on the balance sheet as a building an item of inventory a deferred cost or any  other asset  is an amount  that does not get recognized as an expense in the current period 
6,627,A real life example can be found in the case of WorldCom Inc  a telecom concern that grew rapidly in the late     s   Much of WorldCom s financial reporting was eventually found to be fraudulent and one important part of the  misreporting centered on its treatment of what is known in the telecom industry as  line costs   These are the costs of  carrying a voice call or data transmission from its starting point to its ending point and they represented WorldCom s  largest expense  WorldCom s chief financial officer decided to capitalize such costs instead of treating them as an  operating expense  As a consequence from the second quarter of      through the first quarter of      WorldCom  increased its operating income by    billion  In three of the five quarters in which the improper line cost capitalization  took place WorldCom would have recognized pretax losses instead of profits   
7,627,Similarly acquisitions are an area in which the managers charged with recording an acquisition must exercise  judgment  An allocation of purchase price must be made to all of the different assets acquired based on their fair values  and those fair values are not always objectively verifiable  Management may have to make its own estimate of fair  values for assets acquired and management may be biased towards a low estimate for the values of depreciable assets  in order to depress future depreciation expense  Another benefit to keeping depreciable asset values low is that the  amount of the purchase price that cannot be allocated to specific assets is classified as goodwill which is neither  depreciated nor amortized in future reporting periods 
8,627,Goodwill reporting has choices of its own  Although goodwill has no effect on future earnings when unimpaired  annual testing of its fair value may reveal that the excess of price paid over the fair value of assets may not be  recoverable which should lead to a write down of goodwill  The estimation process for the fair value of goodwill may  depend heavily on projections of future performance  Those projections may be biased upward in order to avoid a  goodwill write down

2,628,       How Choices Affect the Cash Flow Statement
3,628,The cash flow statement consists of three sections  the operating section which shows the cash generated or used by  operations  the investing section which shows the cash used for investments or provided by their disposal  and the  financing section which shows the cash transactions attributable to financing activities 
4,628,The operating section of the cash flow statement is often the portion most scrutinized by investors  Many of them  consider the operating section to be a reality check on the reported earnings on the grounds that significant earnings  that are attributable only to accrual accounting methods and unsupported by actual cash flows may indicate earnings  manipulation  Such investors believe that amounts shown for cash generated by operations is more insulated from  managerial manipulation than the income statement  Cash generated by operations can be managed to an extent  however 
5,628,The operating section of the cash flow statement can be shown either under the direct method or the indirect method   Under the direct method  entities are encouraged to report major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash  payments and their arithmetic sum the net cash flow from operating activities     In practice companies rarely use  the direct method  Instead they use the indirect method which shows a reconciliation of net income to cash provided  by operations  The reconciliation shows the non cash items affecting net income along with changes in working capital  accounts affecting cash provided by operations  Exhibit    provides an example of the indirect presentation method 
6,628,Exhibit     Indirect Presentation Method
7,628,Cash Flows from Operating Activities    millions   Net income Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities  Provision for doubtful receivables Provision for depreciation and amortization Goodwill impairment charges Share based compensation expense Provision for deferred income taxes Changes in assets and liabilities  Trade notes and financing receivables related to sales Inventories Accounts payable Accrued income taxes payable receivable Retirement benefits Other

12,628,Whether the indirect method or direct method is used simple choices exist for managers to improve the appearance of  cash flow provided by operations without actually improving it  One such choice is in the area of accounts payable  management shaded in Exhibit     Assume that the accounts payable balance is       million at the end of the period  an increase of       million from its previous year end balance of       million  The       million increase in  accounts payable matched increased expenses and or assets but did not require cash  If the company s managers had  further delayed paying creditors      million until the day after the balance sheet date they could have increased the  cash provided by operating activities by      million  If the managers believe that the cash generated from operations  is a metric of focus for investors the managers could impress them with an artificially stronger cash flow by simply  stretching the accounts payable credit period 
13,628,What might alert investors to such machinations  They need to examine the composition of the operations section of  the cash flow statement if they do not then nothing will ever alert them  Studying changes in the working capital can  reveal unusual patterns that may indicate manipulation of the cash provided by operations

2,629,Another practice that might lead an investor to question the quality of cash provided by operations is to compare a  company s cash generation with an industry wide level or with the cash operating performance of one or more similar  competitors  Cash generation performance can be measured several ways  One way is to compare the relationship  between cash generated by operations and net income  Cash generated by operations in excess of net income signifies  better quality of earnings whereas a chronic excess of net income over cash generated by operations should be a cause  for concern  it may signal the use of accounting methods to simply raise net income instead of depicting financial  reality  Another way to measure cash generation performance is to compare cash generated by operations with debt  service capital expenditures and dividends  if any   When there is a wide variance between the company s cash  generation performance and that of its benchmarks investors should seek an explanation and carefully examine the  changes in working capital accounts 
3,629,Because investors may focus on cash provided by operations as an important metric managers may resort to managing  the working capital accounts as described in order to present the most favorable picture of cash provided by operations   But there are other means to improve the cash generation picture  A company may misclassify operating uses of cash  into either the investing or financing sections of the cash flow statement which enhances the appearance of cash  generated by operating activities 
4,629,Dynegy Inc  provides an example of manipulation of cash from operations through clever construction of contracts and  assistance from an unconsolidated special purpose entity named ABG Gas Supply LLC  ABG   In April      Dynegy  entered into a contract for the purchase of natural gas from ABG  According to the contract Dynegy would purchase  gas at below market rates from ABG for nine months and sell it at the current market rate  The nine month term  coincided with Dynegy s      year end and would result in gains backed by cash flows  Dynegy also agreed to buy gas  at above market rates from ABG for the following    months and sell it at the current market rate  The contract was  reported at its fair value at the end of fiscal year       It had no effect on net income for the year  The earlier portion of  the contract resulted in a gain supported by      million of cash flow but the latter portion of the contract resulted in  non cash losses that offset the profit  The mark to market rules required the recognition of both gains and losses from  all parts of the contract and hence the net effect on earnings was zero 
5,629,In April      a Wall Street Journal article exposed the chicanery thanks to leaked documents  The SEC required  Dynegy to restate the cash flow statement by reclassifying      million from the operating section of the cash flow  statement to the financing section on the grounds that Dynegy had used ABG as a conduit to effectively borrow       million from Citigroup  The bank had extended credit to ABG which it used to finance its losses on the contract  Lee        
6,629,Another area of flexibility in cash flow statement reporting is found in the area of interest capitalization which creates  differences between total interest payments and total interest costs    Assume a company incurs total interest cost of         composed of       of discount amortization and        of interest payments  Of the        two thirds of  it          is expensed  the remaining third          is capitalized as plant assets  If the company uses the same  interest expense capitalization proportions to allocate the interest payments between operating and investing activities  then it will report                       as an operating outflow and                      as an investing outflow   The company might also choose to offset the entire       of non cash discount amortization against the         treated as expense resulting in an operating outflow as low as        or as much as        if it allocated all of the  non cash discount amortization to interest capitalized as investing activities  Similarly the investing outflow could be  as much as        or as little as       depending on the treatment of the non cash discount amortization  There are  choices within the choices all in areas where investors believe choices do not even exist  Nurnberg and Largay        note that companies apparently favor the method that reports the lowest operating outflow presumably to maximize  reported cash from operations 
7,629,Investors and analysts need to be aware that presentation choices permitted in IAS    Statement of Cash Flows  offer  flexibility in classification of certain items in the cash flow statement  This flexibility can drastically change the results  in the operating section of the cash flow statement  An excerpt from IAS   Paragraphs    and    provides the  background 
8,629,    Interest paid and interest and dividends received are usually classified as operating cash flows for a  financial institution  However there is no consensus on the classification of these cash flows for other  entities  Interest paid and interest and dividends received may be classified as operating cash flows because  they enter into the determination of profit or loss  Alternatively interest paid and interest and dividends  received may be classified as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively because they are  costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments 
9,629,    Dividends paid may be classified as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining financial  resources  Alternatively dividends paid may be classified as a component of cash flows from operating  activities in order to assist users to determine the ability of an entity to pay dividends out of operating cash  flows   Emphasis added

2,630,By allowing a choice of operating or financing for the placement of interest and dividends received or paid IAS   gives  a company s managers the opportunities to select the presentation that gives the best looking picture of operating  performance  An example is Norse Energy Corp  ASA a Norwegian gas explorer and producer which changed its  classifications of interest paid and interest received in       Gordon Henry Jorgensen and Linthicum         Interest paid was switched to financing instead of decreasing cash generated from operations  Norse Energy also  switched its classification of interest received to investing from operating cash flow  The net effect of these changes  was to report positive rather than negative operating cash flows in both      and       With these simple changes the  company could also change the perception of its operations  The cash flow statement formerly presented the appearance  of a company with operations that used more cash than it generated and it possibly raised questions about the  sustainability of operations  After the revision the operating section of the cash flow statement depicted a much more  viable operation

12,630,Exhibit     Areas Where Choices and Estimates Affect Financial Reporting
13,630,Area of  Choice Estimate Revenue  recognition
14,630,Analyst Concerns   How is revenue recognized  upon shipment or upon delivery of goods 
15,630,  Is the company engaging in  channel stuffing  the practice of overloading a  distribution channel with more product than it is normally capable of selling   This can be accomplished by inducing customers to buy more through unusual  discounts the threat of near term price increases or both or simply by  shipping goods that were not ordered  These transactions may be corrected in a  subsequent period and may even result in restated results  Are accounts  receivable relative to revenues abnormally high for a company relative to its  history or its peers  If so channel stuffing may have occurred 
16,630,  Is there unusual activity in the allowance for sales returns relative to past  history 
17,630,  Does the company s days sales outstanding indicate any collection issues that  might indicate shipment of unneeded or unwanted goods to customers

2,631,Area of  Choice Estimate
3,631,Analyst Concerns   Does the company engage in  bill and hold  transactions  In such  transactions a customer purchases goods but requests that the goods remain  with the seller until a later date  This kind of transaction makes it possible for a  seller to manufacture fictitious sales by declaring end of period inventory as   sold but held  with a minimum of effort and phony documentation 
4,631,  Does the company use rebates as part of its marketing approach  If so how  significantly do the estimates of rebate fulfillment affect net revenues and  have any unusual breaks with history occurred 
5,631,  Does the company separate its revenue arrangements into multiple deliverables  of goods or services  This area is one of great revenue recognition flexibility  and also one that provides little visibility to investors  They simply cannot  examine a company s arrangements and decide for themselves as to the  propriety of revenue allocation to different components of a contract  If a  company uses multiple deliverable arrangements with its customers as a  routine matter investors might be more sensitive to revenue reporting risks  In  seeking a comfort level investors might ask the following questions  Does the  company explain adequately how it determines the different allocations of  deliverables and how revenue is recognized on each one  Do deferred revenues  result  If not does it seem reasonable that there are no deferred revenues for  this kind of arrangement  Are there unusual trends in revenues and  receivables particularly with regard to cash conversion  If an investor cannot  be satisfied with the answers from these questions he or she might be more  comfortable with other investment choices 
6,631,Long lived assets   Depreciation  policies
7,631,  Do the estimated life spans of the associated assets make sense or are they  unusually low compared with others in the same industry 
8,631,  Have there been changes in depreciable lives that have a positive effect on  current earnings 
9,631,  Do recent asset write downs indicate that company policy on asset lives might  need to be reconsidered 
10,631,Intangibles   Capitalization  policies
11,631,  Does the company capitalize expenditures related to intangibles such as  software  Does its balance sheet show any R D capitalized as a result of  acquisitions  Or if the company is an IFRS filer has it capitalized any  internally generated development costs 
12,631,  How do the company s capitalization policies compare with the competition 
13,631,  Are amortization policies reasonable 
14,631,Allowance for  doubtful  accounts loan loss  reserves
15,631,  Are additions to such allowances lower or higher than in the past 
16,631,  Does the collection experience justify any difference from historical  provisioning 
17,631,  Is there a possibility that any lowering of the allowance may be the result of  industry difficulties along with the difficulty of meeting earnings expectations

2,632,Area of  Choice Estimate Inventory cost  methods
3,632,Tax asset  valuation  accounts
4,632,Goodwill
5,632,Warranty reserves
6,632,Analyst Concerns   Does the company use a costing method that produces fair reporting results in  view of its environment  How do its inventory methods compare with others in  its industry  Are there differences that will make comparisons uneven if there  are unusual changes in inflation 
7,632,  Does the company use reserves for obsolescence in its inventory valuation  If  so are they subject to unusual fluctuations that might indicate adjusting them  to arrive at a specified earnings result 
8,632,  If a company reports under US GAAP and uses last in first out  LIFO   inventory accounting does LIFO liquidation  the assumed sale of old lower  cost layers of inventory  occur through inventory reduction programs  This  inventory reduction may generate earnings without supporting cash flow and  management may intentionally reduce the layers to produce specific earnings  benefits 
9,632,  Tax assets if present must be stated at the value at which management expects  to realize them and an allowance must be set up to restate tax assets to the  level expected to eventually be converted into cash  Determining the allowance  involves an estimate of future operations and tax payments  Does the amount  of the valuation allowance seem reasonable overly optimistic or overly  pessimistic 
10,632,  Are there contradictions between the management commentary and the  allowance level or the tax note and the allowance level  There cannot be an  optimistic management commentary and a fully reserved tax asset or vice  versa  One of them has to be wrong 
11,632,  Look for changes in the tax asset valuation account  It may be      reserved  at first and then  optimism  increases whenever an earnings boost is needed   Lowering the reserve decreases tax expense and increases net income 
12,632,  Companies must annually assess goodwill balances for impairment on a  qualitative basis  If further testing appears necessary it is based on estimates of  the fair value of reporting units  US GAAP issuers  or cash generating units   IFRS issuers  which are associated with goodwill balances  The tests are  based on subjective estimates including future cash flows and the employment  of discount rates 
13,632,  Do the disclosures relating to the goodwill testing suggest that the testing was  skewed to avoid goodwill impairment charges 
14,632,  Have additions to the reserves been reduced perhaps to make earnings targets   Examine the trend in the charges of actual costs against the reserves  Do they  support or contradict the warranty provisioning activity  Do the actual costs  charged against the reserve give the analyst any indication about the quality of  the products sold 
15,632,Related party  transactions
16,632,  Is the company engaged in transactions that disproportionately benefit  members of management  Does one company have control over another s  destiny through supply contracts or other dealings 
17,632,  Do extensive dealings take place with non public companies that are under  management control  If so non public companies could absorb losses  through  supply arrangements that are unfavorable to the private company for example   in order to make the public company s performance look good  This scenario  may provide opportunities for an owner to cash out

2,633,The most important lesson is that choices exist among accounting methods and estimates and an analyst needs a  working knowledge of them in order to understand whether management may have made choices to achieve a desired  result 
3,633,     Warning Signs
4,633,The choices management makes to achieve desired results leave a trail like tracks in sand or snow  The evidence or  warning signs of information manipulation in financial reports are directly linked to the basic means of manipulation   biased revenue recognition and biased expense recognition  The bias may relate to timing and or location of  recognition  For example a company may choose to defer expenses by capitalizing them which relates to when an  expense is recognized  In another example a company may choose to recognize a loss in other comprehensive income  or directly through equity rather than through the profit and loss statement which relates to where the loss is  recognized  The alert investor or analyst should do the following to find warning signs 
5,633,   Pay attention to revenue 
6,633,The single largest number on the income statement is revenue and revenue recognition is a recurring source of  accounting manipulation and even outright fraud  Answering the question  Is revenue higher or lower than the  previous comparable period   is not sufficient  Many analytical procedures can be routinely performed to provide  warning signals of accounting malfeasance 
7,633,  Examine the accounting policies note for a company s revenue recognition policies 
8,633,  Consider whether the policies make it easier to prematurely recognize revenue such as recognizing  revenue immediately upon shipment of goods or if the company uses bill and hold arrangements whereby  a sale is recognized before goods are actually shipped to the customer 
9,633,  Barter transactions may exist which can be difficult to value properly 
10,633,  Rebate programs involve many estimates including forecasts of the amount of rebates that will ultimately  be incurred  These estimates can have significant effects on revenue recognition 
11,633,  Multiple deliverable arrangements of goods and services are common but clarity about the timing of  revenue recognition for each item or service delivered is necessary for the investor to be comfortable with  the reporting of revenues 
12,633,Although none of these decisions violates accounting standards each can raise investor suspicions if other  warning signs are present 
13,633,  Look at revenue relationships  Compare a company s revenue growth with its primary competitors or its industry  peer group 
14,633,  If a company s revenue growth is out of line with its competitors its industry or the economy the investor  or analyst needs to understand the reasons for the outperformance  It may be a result of superior  management or products and services but not all management is superior nor are the products and services  of their companies  Revenue quality might be suspect and the investor should take additional analytical  steps 
15,633,  Compare accounts receivable with revenues over several years 
16,633,  Examine the trend to determine whether receivables are increasing as a percentage of total revenues   If so a company might be engaging in channel stuffing activities or worse recording fictitious sales  transactions 
17,633,  Calculate receivables turnover for several years 
18,633,  Examine the trend for unusual changes and seek an explanation if they exist 
19,633,  Compare a company s days sales outstanding  DSO  or receivables turnover with that of  relevant competitors or an industry peer group and determine whether the company is an  outlier 
20,633,An increase in DSO or decrease in receivables turnover could suggest that some revenues are recorded  prematurely or are even fictitious or that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient

2,634,  Examine asset turnover  If a company s managers make poor asset allocation choices revenues may not be  sufficient to justify the investment  Be particularly alert when asset allocation choices involve acquisitions  of entire companies  If post acquisition revenue generation is weak managers might reach for revenue  growth anywhere it can be found  That urge for growth might result in accounting abuses 
3,634,Revenues divided by total assets indicate the productivity of assets in generating revenues  If the  company s asset turnover is continually declining or lagging the asset turnover of competitors or industry  it may portend future asset write downs particularly in the area of goodwill balances for acquisitive  companies 
4,634,   Pay attention to signals from inventories 
5,634,Although inventory is not a component of every company s asset base its presence creates an opportunity for  accounting manipulation 
6,634,  Look at inventory relationships  Because revenues involve items sold from inventory the kind of examination an  investor should perform on inventory is similar to that for revenues 
7,634,  Compare growth in inventories with competitors and industry benchmarks  If a company s inventory  growth is out of line with its peers without any concurrent sales growth then it may be simply the result of  poor inventory management an operational inefficiency that might affect an investor s view of a  company  It may also signal obsolescence problems in the company s inventory that have not yet been  recognized through markdowns to the inventory s net realizable value  Current gross and net profits could  be overstated because of overstated inventory 
8,634,  Calculate the inventory turnover ratio  This ratio is the cost of sales divided by the average ending  inventory  Declining inventory turnover could also suggest obsolescence problems that should be  recognized 
9,634,  Companies reporting under US GAAP may use LIFO inventory cost flow assumptions  When this  assumption is part of the accounting policies and a company operates in an inflationary environment  investors should note whether old low cost inventory costs have been passed through current earnings and  artificially improved gross operating and net profits 
10,634,   Pay attention to capitalization policies and deferred costs 
11,634,In a study of enforcement actions over a five year period the SEC found that improper revenue recognition was the  most prevalent accounting issue    Suppression of expenses was the next most prevalent problem noted  As the earlier  discussion of WorldCom showed improper capitalization practices can result in a significant misstatement of financial  results 
12,634,  Examine the company s accounting policy note for its capitalization policy for long term assets including  interest costs and for its handling of other deferred costs  Compare the company s policy with the industry  practice  If the company is the only one capitalizing certain costs while other industry participants treat them as  expenses a red flag is raised  If an outlier company of this type is encountered it would be useful to cross check  such a company s asset turnover and profitability margins with others in its industry  An investor might expect  such a company to be more profitable than its competitors but the investor might also have lower confidence in  the quality of the reported numbers 
13,634,   Pay attention to the relationship of cash flow and net income 
14,634,Net income propels stock prices but cash flow pays bills  Management can manipulate either one but sooner or later  net income must be realized in cash if a company is to remain viable  When net income is higher than cash provided by  operations one possibility is that aggressive accrual accounting policies have shifted current expenses to later periods   Increasing earnings in the presence of declining cash generated by operations might signal accounting irregularities 
15,634,  Construct a time series of cash generated by operations divided by net income  If the ratio is consistently below      or has declined repeatedly there may be problems in the company s accrual accounts 
16,634,   Other potential warnings signs 
17,634,Other areas that might suggest further analysis include the following

2,635,  Depreciation methods and useful lives  As discussed earlier depreciation methods and the useful lives selected  can greatly influence profitability  An investor should compare a company s policies with those of its peers to  determine whether it is particularly lenient in its effects on earnings  Investors should likewise compare the  length of depreciable lives used by a company with those used by its peers 
3,635,  Fourth quarter surprises  An investor should be suspicious of possible earnings management if a company  routinely disappoints investors with poor earnings or overachieves in the fourth quarter of the year when no  seasonality exists in the business  The company may be over  or under reporting profits in the first three quarters  of the year 
4,635,  Presence of related party transactions  Related party transactions often arise when a company s founders are still  very active in managing the company with much of their wealth tied to the company s fortunes  They may be  more biased in their view of a company s performance because it relates directly to their own wealth and  reputations and they may be able to transact business with the company in ways that may not be detected  For  instance they may purchase unsellable inventory from the company for disposal in another company of their own  in order to avoid markdowns 
5,635,  Non operating income or one time sales included in revenue  To disguise weakening revenue growth or just to  enhance revenue growth a company might classify non operating income items into revenues or fail to clarify  the nature of revenues  In the first quarter of      Sunbeam Corporation included one time disposal of product  lines in sales without indicating that such non recurring sales were included in revenues  This inclusion gave  investors a false impression of the company s sustainable revenue generating capability 
6,635,  Classification of expenses as  non recurring   To make operating performance look more attractive managers  might carve out  special items  in the income statement  Particularly when such special items appear period after  period equity investors might find their interests best served by not giving serial  special items  such treatment  and instead focusing on the net income line in evaluating performance over long periods 
7,635,  Gross operating margins out of line with competitors or industry  This disparity is an ambivalent warning sign  It  might signal superior management ability  But it might also signal the presence of accounting manipulations to  add a veneer of superior management ability to the company s reputation  Only the compilation and examination  of other warning signals will enable an investor or analyst to decide which signal is being given 
8,635,Warning signals are just that  signals not indisputable declarations of accounting manipulation guilt  Investors and  analysts need to evaluate them cohesively not on an isolated basis  When an investor finds a number of these signals  the subject investment should be viewed with caution or even discarded in favor of alternatives 
9,635,Furthermore as discussed earlier context is important in judging the value of warning signals  A few examples of facts  and circumstances to be aware of are as follows 
10,635,  Younger companies with an unblemished record of meeting growth projections  It is plausible especially for a  younger company with new and popular product offerings to generate above average returns for a period of  time  But as demand dissipates products mature and competitors challenge for market share management may  seek to extend its recent record of rapid growth in sales and profitability by unconventional means  At this point  the  earnings games  begin  aggressive estimates drawing down  cookie jar  reserves selling assets for  accounting gains taking on excess leverage or entering into financial transactions with no apparent business  purpose other than financial statement  window dressing  
11,635,  Management has adopted a minimalist approach to disclosure  Confidence in accounting quality depends on  disclosure  For example when large companies claim that they have only one reportable segment or that  management s commentary is similar from period to period there is cause for concern  If management does not  seem to take seriously its obligation to provide information one needs to be concerned  A plausible explanation  for minimalist disclosure policies could be that management is protecting investors  interests by withholding  valuable information from competitors  But this explanation is not necessarily the case  For example after Sony  Corporation acquired CBS Records and Columbia Pictures it incurred substantial losses for a number of years   Yet Sony chose to hide its negative trends and doubtful future prospects by aggregating the results within a much  larger  Entertainment Division   In      after Sony ultimately wrote off much of the goodwill associated with  these ill fated acquisitions the SEC sanctioned Sony and its CFO for failing to separately discuss them in  MD A in a balanced manner

2,636,  Management fixation on earnings reports  Beware of companies whose management appears to be fixated on  reported earnings sometimes to the detriment of attending to real drivers of value  Indicators of excessive  earnings fixation include the aggressive use of non GAAP measures of performance special items or non  recurring charges  Another indicator of earnings fixation is highly decentralized operations in which division  managers  compensation packages are heavily weighted toward the attainment of reported earnings or non  GAAP measures of performance 
3,636,A company s culture is an intangible that investors should bear in mind when they are evaluating financial statements  for the possibility of accounting manipulation  A management s highly competitive mentality may serve investors well  when the company conducts business  assuming that actions taken are not unethical illegal or harmfully myopic  but  that kind of thinking should not extend to communications with the owners of the company  the shareholders  That  mentality can lead to the kind of accounting gamesmanship seen in the early part of the century  In examining financial  statements for warning signs of manipulation the investor should consider whether that mindset exists in the  preparation of the financial statements 
4,636,One notable example of the mindset comes from one of the most recognized corporate names in the world General  Electric  In the mid     s GE acquired Kidder Peabody and it was ultimately determined that much of the earnings  that Kidder had reported were bogus  As a consequence GE would announce within two days that it would take a non  cash write off of      million  Here is how former CEO Chair Jack Welsh described the ensuing meeting with senior  management in his memoir Straight from the Gut 
5,636, The response of our business leaders to the crisis was typical of the GE culture  emphasis added   Even  though the books had closed on the quarter many immediately offered to pitch in to cover the Kidder gap   Some said they could find an extra     million     million and even     million from their businesses to  offset the surprise  Though it was too late their willingness to help was a dramatic contrast to the excuses I  had been hearing from the Kidder people    p      
6,636,It appears that the corporate governance apparatus fostered a GE culture that extended the concept of teamwork to the  point of  sharing  profits to win one for the team as a whole which is incompatible with the concept of neutral  financial reporting  Although research is not conclusive on this question it may also be worth considering that  predisposition to earnings manipulation is more likely to be present when the CEO and board chair are one and the  same or when the audit committee of the board essentially serves at the pleasure of the CEO and lacks financial  reporting sophistication  Finally one could discuss whether the financial reporting environment today would reward or  penalize a CEO who openly endorsed a view that he could legitimately exercise financial reporting discretion albeit  within limits for the purpose of artificially smoothing earnings 
7,636,Restructuring and or impairment charges 
8,636,At times a company s stock price has been observed to rise after it recognized a  big bath  charge to earnings of the  current period  The conventional wisdom explaining the stock price rise is that accounting recognition signals  something positive  that management is now ready to part with the lagging portion of a company so as to redirect its  attention and talents to more profitable activities  Consequently the earnings charge should be disregarded for being  solely related to past events 
9,636,The analyst should also consider however that the events leading ultimately to the big bath on the financial statements  did not happen overnight even though the accounting for those events occurs at a subsequent point  Management may  want to communicate that the accounting adjustments reflect the company s new path but the restructuring charge also  indicates that the old path of reported earnings was not real  In particular expenses reported in prior years were very  likely understated even assuming that no improper financial statement manipulation had occurred  To extrapolate  historical earnings trends an analyst should consider making pro forma analytical adjustments of prior years  earnings  to reflect in those prior years a reasonable share of the current period s restructuring and impairment charges 
10,636,Management has a merger and acquisition orientation 
11,636,Tyco International Ltd  acquired more than     companies from      to       Even assuming the best of intentions  regarding financial reporting a growth at any cost corporate culture poses a severe challenge to operational and  financial reporting controls  In Tyco s case the SEC found that it consistently and fraudulently understated assets  acquired  lowering future depreciation and amortization charges  and overstated liabilities assumed  avoiding expense  recognition and potentially increasing earnings in future periods

2,637,   CONCLUSION
3,637,Financial reporting quality varies across companies  The ability to assess the quality of a company s financial reporting  is an important skill for analysts  Indications of low quality financial reporting can prompt an analyst to maintain  heightened skepticism when reading a company s reports to review disclosures critically when undertaking financial  statement analysis and to incorporate appropriate adjustments in assessments of past performance and forecasts of  future performance 
4,637,  Financial reporting quality can be thought of as spanning a continuum from the highest  containing information  that is relevant correct complete and unbiased  to the lowest  containing information that is not just biased or  incomplete but possibly pure fabrication  
5,637,  Reporting quality the focus of this reading pertains to the information disclosed  High quality reporting  represents the economic reality of the company s activities during the reporting period and the company s  financial condition at the end of the period 
6,637,  Results quality  commonly referred to as earnings quality  pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the  company s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition relative to expectations of current and  future financial performance 
7,637,  An aspect of financial reporting quality is the degree to which accounting choices are conservative or aggressive    Aggressive  typically refers to choices that aim to enhance the company s reported performance and financial  position by inflating the amount of revenues earnings and or operating cash flow reported in the period  or by  decreasing the amount of expenses reported in the period and or the amount of debt reported on the balance sheet 
8,637,  Conservatism in financial reports can result from either     accounting standards that specifically require a  conservative treatment of a transaction or an event or     judgments necessarily made by managers when  applying accounting standards that result in more  or less conservative results 
9,637,  An example of conservatism in the oil and gas industry is the revenue recognition accounting standard  This  standard permits recognition of revenue only at time of shipment rather than closer to the time of actual value  creation which is the time of discovery 
10,637,  Managers may be motivated to issue less than high quality financial reports in order to mask poor performance  to boost the stock price to increase personal compensation and or to avoid violation of debt covenants 
11,637,  Conditions that are conducive to the issuance of low quality financial reports include cultural environment  attributes that result in fewer or less transparent financial disclosures book tax conformity that shifts emphasis  toward legal compliance and away from fair presentation and limited capital markets regulation 
12,637,  Mechanisms that discipline financial reporting quality include the free market and incentives for companies to  minimize cost of capital auditors contract provisions specifically tailored to penalize misreporting and  enforcement by regulatory entities 
13,637,  Pro forma earnings  also commonly referred to as non GAAP or non IFRS earnings  adjust earnings as reported  on the income statement  Pro forma earnings that exclude negative items are a hallmark of aggressive  presentation choices 
14,637,  Companies are required to make additional disclosures when presenting any non GAAP or non IFRS metric 
15,637,  Managers  considerable flexibility in choosing their companies  accounting policies and in formulating estimates  provides opportunities for aggressive accounting 
16,637,  Examples of accounting choices that affect earnings and balance sheets include inventory cost flow assumptions  estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable estimated realizability of deferred tax assets depreciation method  estimated salvage value of depreciable assets and estimated useful life of depreciable assets 
17,637,  Cash from operations is a metric of interest to investors that can be enhanced by operating choices such as  stretching accounts payable and potentially by classification choices

10,642,SOLUTIONS
11,642,   B is correct  Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of information in financial reports  High quality  financial reporting provides decision useful information which is relevant and faithfully represents the economic  reality of the company s activities  Earnings of high quality are sustainable and provide an adequate level of  return  Highest quality financial reports reflect both high financial reporting quality and high earnings quality 
12,642,   C is correct  Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of the information contained in financial reports   High quality financial reports provide decision useful information that faithfully represents the economic reality  of the company  Low quality financial reports impede assessment of earnings quality  Financial reporting quality  is distinguishable from earnings quality which pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company s  actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition  Low quality earnings are not sustainable and  decrease company value 
13,642,   B is correct  Financial reporting quality pertains to the quality of the information contained in financial reports  If  financial reporting quality is low the information provided is not useful to assess the company s performance   Financial reporting quality is distinguishable from earnings quality which pertains to the earnings and cash  generated by the company s actual economic activities and the resulting financial condition 
14,642,   B is correct  Earnings quality pertains to the earnings and cash generated by the company s actual economic  activities and the resulting financial condition  Low quality earnings are likely not sustainable over time because  the company does not expect to generate the same level of earnings in the future or because earnings will not  generate sufficient return on investment to sustain the company in the future  Earnings that are not sustainable  decrease company value  Earnings quality is distinguishable from financial reporting quality which pertains to  the quality of the information contained in financial reports 
15,642,   A is correct  Earnings that result from non recurring activities are unsustainable  Unsustainable earnings are an  example of lower quality earnings  Recognizing earnings that result from non recurring activities is neither a  biased accounting choice or indicative of lower quality financial reporting because it faithfully represents  economic events 
16,642,   B is correct  At the top of the quality spectrum of financial reports are reports that conform to GAAP are  decision useful and have earnings that are sustainable and offer adequate returns  In other words these reports  have both high financial reporting quality and high earnings quality 
17,642,   A is correct  Financial reports span a quality continuum from high to low based on decision usefulness and  earnings quality  see Exhibit   of the reading   The lowest quality reports portray fictitious events which may  misrepresent the company s performance and or obscure fraudulent misappropriation of the company s assets 
18,642,   B is correct  Deferring research and development  R D  investments into the next reporting period is an example  of earnings management by taking a real action

2,643,   B is correct  High quality financial reports offer useful information meaning information that is relevant and  faithfully represents actual performance  Although low earnings quality may not be desirable if the reported  earnings are representative of actual performance they are consistent with high quality financial reporting   Highest quality financial reports reflect both high financial reporting quality and high earnings quality 
3,643,    B is correct  Aggressive accounting choices aim to enhance the company s reported performance by inflating the  amount of revenues earnings and or operating cash flow reported in the period  Consequently the financial  performance for the current period would most likely exhibit an upward bias 
4,643,    C is correct  Accounting choices are considered conservative if they decrease the company s reported  performance and financial position in the current period  Conservative choices may increase the amount of debt  reported on the balance sheet  Conservative accounting choices may decrease the amount of revenues earnings  and or operating cash flow reported in the current period and increase those amounts in later periods 
5,643,    A is correct  Conservatism reduces the possibility of litigation and by extension litigation costs  Rarely if ever  is a company sued because it understated good news or overstated bad news  Accounting conservatism is a type  of bias in financial reporting that decreases a company s reported performance in the current period   Conservatism directly conflicts with the characteristic of neutrality 
6,643,    A is correct  Managers often have incentives to meet or beat market expectations particularly if management  compensation is linked to increases in stock prices or to reported earnings 
7,643,    B is correct  Managers may be motivated to understate earnings in the current period and increase the probability  of meeting or exceeding the next period s earnings target 
8,643,    C is correct  Typically conditions of opportunity motivation and rationalization exist when individuals issue  low quality financial reports  Rationalization exists when an individual is concerned about a choice and needs to  be able to justify it to herself or himself  If the manager is concerned about a choice in a financial reports she or  he may ask for other opinions to convince herself or himself that it is okay 
9,643,    C is correct  In a period of strong financial performance managers may pursue accounting choices that increase  the probability of exceeding next period s earnings forecasts  By accelerating expense recognition or delaying  revenue recognition managers may increase earnings in the next period and increase the likelihood of exceeding  next period s earnings targets 
10,643,    B is correct  Motivation can result from pressure to meet some criteria for personal reasons such as a bonus or  corporate reasons such as concern about financing in the future  Poor internal controls and an inattentive board  of directors offer opportunities to issue low quality financial reports 
11,643,    A is correct  The possibility of bond covenant violations may motivate managers to inflate earnings in the current  period  By inflating earnings in the current period the company may be able to avoid the consequences  associated with violating bond covenants 
12,643,    A is correct  Opportunities to issue low quality financial reports include internal conditions such as an ineffective  board of directors and external conditions such as accounting standards that provide scope for divergent choices   Pressure to achieve some performance level and corporate concerns about financing in the future are examples of  motivations to issue low quality financial reports  Typically three conditions exist when low quality financial  reports are issued  opportunity motivation and rationalization 
13,643,    C is correct  An audit is intended to provide assurance that the company s financial reports are presented fairly  thus providing discipline regarding financial reporting quality  Regulatory agencies usually require that the  financial statements of publicly traded companies be audited by an independent auditor to provide assurance that  the financial statements conform to accounting standards  Privately held companies may also choose to obtain  audit opinions either voluntarily or because an outside party requires it  An audit is not typically intended to  detect fraud  An audit is based on sampling and it is possible that the sample might not reveal misstatements 
14,643,    B is correct  If a company uses a non GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing it is required to provide the most  directly comparable GAAP measure with equivalent prominence in the filing  In addition the company is  required to provide a reconciliation between the non GAAP measure and the equivalent GAAP measure   Similarly IFRS require that any non IFRS measures included in financial reports must be defined and their  potential relevance explained  The non IFRS measures must be reconciled with IFRS measures

2,644,    B is correct  If a company wants to increase reported earnings the company s managers may reduce the  allowance for uncollected accounts and uncollected accounts expense reported in the period  Decreasing the  useful life of depreciable assets would increase depreciation expense and decrease earnings in the current period   Classifying a purchase as an expense rather than a capital expenditure would decrease earnings in the current  period  The use of accrual accounting may result in estimates included in financial reports because all facts  associated with events may not be known at the time of recognition  These estimates can be grounded in reality  or can be managed by the company to present a desired financial picture 
3,644,    B is correct  Bias in revenue recognition can lead to manipulation of information presented in financial reports   Addressing the question as to whether revenue is higher or lower than the previous period is not sufficient to  determine if there is bias in revenue recognition  Additional analytical procedures must be performed to provide  warning signals of accounting malfeasance  Barter transactions are difficult to value properly and may result in  bias in revenue recognition  Policies that make it easier to prematurely recognize revenue such as revenue being  recognized before goods are shipped to customers may be a warning sign of accounting malfeasance 
4,644,    A is correct  Managers can temporarily show a higher cash flow from operations by stretching the accounts  payable credit period  In other words the managers delay payments until the next accounting period  Applying all  non cash discount amortization against interest capitalized causes reported interest expenses and operating cash  outflow to be higher resulting in a lower cash flow provided by operations  Shifting the classification of interest  paid from financing to operating cash flows lowers the cash flow provided by operations 
5,644,    C is correct  If a company s days sales outstanding  DSO  is increasing relative to competitors this may be a  signal that revenues are being recorded prematurely or are even fictitious  There are numerous analytical  procedures that can be performed to provide evidence of manipulation of information in financial reporting   These warning signs are often linked to bias associated with revenue recognition and expense recognition  policies 
6,644,    B is correct  If the ratio of cash flow to net income for a company is consistently below   or has declined  repeatedly over time this may be a signal of manipulation of information in financial reports through aggressive  accrual accounting policies  When net income is consistently higher than cash provided by operations one  possible explanation is that the company may be using aggressive accrual accounting policies to shift current  expenses to later periods 
7,644,    C is correct  To extrapolate historical earnings trends an analyst should consider making pro forma analytical  adjustments of prior years  earnings to reflect in those prior years a reasonable share of the current period s  restructuring and impairment charges 
8,644,NOTES
9,644, In this reading the examples of misleading or inaccurate financial reports occurred in prior years not because there are no current examples  of questionable financial reporting but rather because it has been conclusively resolved that misreporting occurred in the historical examples 
10,644, The characteristics of decision useful information are identical under IFRS and US GAAP  In September      the IASB adopted the  Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting in place of the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements         The Conceptual Framework represents the partial completion of a joint convergence project between the IASB and FASB on an  updated framework  The Conceptual Framework        contains two updated chapters   The Objective of Financial Reporting  and   Qualitative Characteristics of Useful Financial Information   The remainder of the material in the Conceptual Framework is from the  Framework        and will be updated as the project is completed  Also in September      the FASB issued Concepts Statement     Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting  to replace Concepts Statements   and

13,644, The term  non GAAP  refers generally to all metrics that are non compliant with generally accepted accounting principles and thus includes   non IFRS  metrics 
14,644, A survey of non GAAP earnings in the S P     is presented in Ciesielski and Henry         Some observers even recommend that investors  shift their focus from a company s earnings to a company s  strategic assets  and the contribution of these assets to its competitive edge  Gu  and Lev       
15,644, Non domestic private issuers can file financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS without reconciliation to US GAAP  The SEC  recognizes US GAAP and IFRS as GAAP 
16,644, Various definitions have appeared in academic research  Closest to the discussion here is Schipper        which uses the term  earnings  management  to mean   disclosure management  in the sense of a purposeful intervention in the external financial reporting process with the  intent of obtaining some private gain  as opposed to say merely facilitating the neutral operation of the process

8,647,   APPLICATION  EVALUATING PAST FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE
9,647,Analysts examine a company s past financial performance for a number of reasons  Cross sectional  analysis of financial performance facilitates understanding of the comparability of companies for a  market based valuation   Analysis of a company s historical performance over time can provide a basis  for a forward looking analysis of the company  Both cross sectional and trend analysis can provide  information for evaluating the quality and performance of a company s management 
10,647,An evaluation of a company s past performance addresses not only what happened  i e  how the company  performed  but also why it happened the causes behind the performance and how the performance  reflects the company s strategy  Evaluative judgments assess whether the performance is better or worse  than a relevant benchmark such as the company s own historical performance a competitor s  performance or market expectations  Some key analytical questions include the following 
11,647,  How and why have corporate measures of profitability efficiency liquidity and solvency changed  over the periods being analyzed

2,648,  How do the level and trend in a company s profitability efficiency liquidity and solvency compare  with the corresponding results of other companies in the same industry  What factors explain any  differences 
3,648,  What aspects of performance are critical for a company to successfully compete in its industry and  how did the company perform relative to those critical performance aspects 
4,648,  What are the company s business model and strategy and how did they influence the company s  performance as reflected in for example its sales growth efficiency and profitability 
5,648,Data available to answer these questions include the company s  and its competitors   financial  statements materials from the company s investor relations department corporate press releases and  non financial statement regulatory filings such as proxies  Useful data also include industry information   e g  from industry surveys trade publications and government sources  consumer information  e g   from consumer satisfaction surveys  and information that is gathered by the analyst firsthand  e g   through on site visits   Processing the data typically involves creating common size financial statements  calculating financial ratios and reviewing or calculating industry specific metrics  Example   illustrates  the effects of strategy on performance and the use of basic economic reasoning in interpreting results 
6,648,EXAMPLE  
7,648,A Change in Strategy Reflected in Financial  Performance
8,648,Apple Inc  is a company that has evolved and adapted over time  In its      Prospectus  Form     B   filed with the US SEC Apple identified itself as  one of the world s leading personal  computer technology companies   At that time most of its revenue was generated by computer  sales  In the prospectus however Apple stated  The Company s strategy is to expand its market  share in the personal computing industry while developing and expanding into new related  business such as Personal Interactive Electronics and Apple Business Systems   Over time  products other than computers became significant generators of revenue and profit  In its       Annual Report  Form    K  filed with the SEC Apple stated in Part I Item   under Business  Strategy  The Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers  through its innovative hardware software peripherals services and Internet offerings  The  Company s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop       to provide its  customers new products and solutions with superior ease of use seamless integration and  innovative industrial design        The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior  and well integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions   Clearly the company is no longer  simply a personal computer technology company 
9,648,In analyzing the historical performance of Apple as of the beginning of      an analyst might  refer to the information presented in Exhibit    Panel A presents selected financial data for the  company from      to       Panels B and C present excerpts from the segment note  Panel B  reports the net sales by product in millions of dollars and Panel C reports the unit sales by  product in thousands   Because Apple manages its business on the basis of geographical  segments the more complete data required in segment reporting  i e  segment operating income  and segment assets  is available only by geographical segment not by product  
10,648,In      an article in Barron s said  In the last year the iPod has become Apple s best selling  product bringing in a third of revenues for the Cupertino Calif  firm       Little noticed by these  iPod zealots however is a looming threat       Wireless phone companies are teaming up with the  music industry to make most mobile phones into music players   Barron s    June      p        The threat noted by Barron s was not unnoticed or ignored by Apple

3,650,Using the information provided address the following 
4,650,   Typically products that are differentiated either through recognizable brand names  proprietary technology unique styling or some combination of these features can be sold at  a higher price than commodity products 
5,650,A  In general would the selling prices of differentiated products be more directly  reflected in a company s operating profit margin or gross profit margin 
6,650,B  Does Apple s financial data  Panel A  reflect a successful differentiation strategy 
7,650,   How liquid is Apple at the end of fiscal      and       In general what are some of the  considerations that a company makes in managing its liquidity 
8,650,   Based on the product segment data for       Panels B and C  Apple s primary source of  revenue was from sales of computers  the        million in sales of Mac computers  represented    percent of total net sales  and its secondary source of revenue was from  iPods  How has the company s product mix changed since      and what might this  change suggest for an analyst examining Apple relative to its competitors 
9,650,Solution to   
10,650,A  Sales of differentiated products at premium prices would generally be reflected more  directly in the gross profit margin  such sales would have a higher gross profit margin all  else equal  The effect of premium pricing generally would also be reflected in a higher  operating margin  Expenditures on advertising and or research are required to support  differentiation however which means that the effect of premium pricing on operating profit  margins is often weaker than the effect on gross profit margins 
11,650,B  Based on Apple s financial data in Panel A the company appears to have successfully  implemented a differentiation strategy with gross margin increasing from    percent of  sales to    percent of sales as shown in the following table

2,651,Solution to   
3,651,Apple was very liquid at the end of fiscal      and      with current ratios of respectively                      and                        In addition the company had      and       percent of total assets invested in cash and marketable securities at the end of respectively       and       In general some of the considerations that a company makes in managing its liquidity  include the following      maintaining enough cash and other liquid assets to ensure that it can  meet near term operating expenditures and unexpected needs     avoiding excessive amounts of  cash because the return on cash assets is almost always less than the company s costs of capital to  finance its assets and     accumulating cash that will be used for acquisitions  sometimes referred  to as a  war chest  which is illustrated in Exhibit     Apple may be accumulating a war chest but  an analyst might given point   above question the amount of cash and marketable securities on  hand 
4,651,Solution to   
5,651,In      the proportion of Apple s total sales from computers declined from    percent to     percent and the proportion of total sales from iPods declined from    percent to    percent  The  biggest shift in product sales was the increase in iPhone sales from   percent in      the year of  the product s introduction to    percent in       In      the proportion of Apple s total sales  from computers and iPods continued to decline and the proportion from iPhones continued to  increase  These proportions in      were respectively    percent    percent and    percent of  total sales  The iPad introduced in fiscal      represented   percent of total sales that year  For an  analyst examining Apple relative to its competitors the relevant comparable companies clearly  changed from      to       Recently the company may be more appropriately compared not only  with other computer manufacturers but also with mobile phone manufacturers and companies  developing competing software and systems for mobile internet devices  Apple s product  innovation has reshaped the competitive landscape 
6,651,To illustrate the use of a war chest Exhibit   provides descriptions of several companies  cash positions  and potential uses of their funds  When a company has accumulated large amounts of cash an analyst  should consider the likely implications for a company s strategic actions  i e  potential acquisitions  or  financing decisions  e g  share buybacks dividends or debt repayment  
7,651,Exhibit    War Chests
8,651,The expression  war chest  is sometimes used to refer to large cash balances that a company  accumulates prior to making acquisitions  Some examples are shown here 
9,651,Apple Inc 
10,651,Apple closed      with nearly     billion in the bank in the form of cash short  term and long term marketable securities  That  war chest  as one shareholder  described it  during Apple s annual shareholder s meeting  has fueled speculation  about what the company might do with the funds  Options could include large  acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders in the form of a buyback or dividend

4,652,In calculating and interpreting financial statement ratios an analyst needs to be aware of the potential  impact on the financial statements and related ratios of companies reporting under different accounting  standards such as international financial reporting standards  IFRS  US generally accepted accounting  principles  US GAAP  or other home country GAAP  Furthermore even within a given set of accounting  standards companies still have discretion to choose among acceptable methods  A company also may  make different assumptions and estimates even when applying the same method as another company   Therefore making selected adjustments to a company s financial statement data may be useful to  facilitate comparisons with other companies or with the industry overall  Examples of such analyst  adjustments will be discussed in Section   
5,652,Non US companies that use any acceptable body of accounting standards  other than IFRS or US GAAP   and file with the US SEC  because their shares or depositary receipts based on their shares trade in the  United States  are required to reconcile their net income and shareholders  equity accounts to US GAAP   Note that in      the SEC eliminated the reconciliation requirement for non US companies using IFRS  and filing with the SEC  Example   uses reconciliation data from SEC filings to illustrate how  differences in accounting standards can affect financial ratio comparisons  The differences in the example  are very large

13,653,Based on TMX s reconciliation note the most significant adjustment for TMX between Mexican  GAAP and US GAAP was an adjustment to shareholders  equity for  Labor obligations  SFAS         The US accounting standard SFAS     Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit  Pension and Other Postretirement Plans now codified as Accounting Standards Codification   ASC       i e  Expenses  Compensation Retirement Benefits  requires companies to reflect on  their balance sheets the funded status of pensions and other post employment benefits   Funded  status equals plan assets minus plan obligations   For an underfunded plan i e  one in which  assets that are held in trust to pay for the obligation are less than the amount of the obligation the  amount of underfunding is shown as a liability and as a reduction to shareholders  equity   The full  reconciliation between shareholders  equity under Mexican FRS and US GAAP  not presented  here  shows that the adjustment related to SFAS     reduced equity at TMX by       million  pesos and       million pesos in      and      respectively  
14,653,Based on TNE s reconciliation note the most significant adjustment for TNE between Brazilian  GAAP and US GAAP was an increase to net income to recognize a  bargain purchase gain on  business combination   A bargain purchase gain under US GAAP results when the purchase price  of an acquisition is less than the fair value  as of the acquisition date  of the net identified assets  acquired  The adjustment for the bargain purchase gain represented an increase of      million  Brazilian reais to net income as reported under Brazilian GAAP 
15,653,Does the difference in accounting standards affect the ROE comparison 
16,653,Solution 
17,653,When ROE is compared under different standards both of the non US companies report  significantly higher ROE under US GAAP than under home country GAAP  Mexican GAAP for  TMX and Brazilian GAAP for TNE

2,654,When ROE is compared across companies TMX s ROE is higher than that of both of the other  two companies regardless of whether the comparison is based on home country amounts or US  GAAP amounts  For TNE however the company reported a loss and thus a negative ROE under  home country  Brazilian  GAAP but a profit under US GAAP  The ROE for TNE is lower than  VZ s ROE when calculations are based on home country GAAP but higher than VZ s ROE when  calculations are based on US GAAP 
3,654,Results of the calculations are summarized in the following table with the calculations based on  TMX s Mexican GAAP explained after the table

10,654,For an illustration of the ROE calculation we have calculated TMX s ROE  with all numbers in  thousands of Mexican pesos  as                                              Note that  TMX s significantly higher ROE under US GAAP is the result of a much lower shareholders   equity under US GAAP than under Mexican GAAP 
11,654,In Example   the      ROE for both TMX and TNE differed substantially under home country GAAP  and US GAAP  In general because the reconciliation data are no longer required by the SEC we cannot  determine whether differences in net income equity and thus ROE also exist between IFRS and the  companies  home country GAAP  including US GAAP   Historically research indicates that for most  non US companies filing with the SEC differences in net income between US GAAP and home country  GAAP average     percent of market value of equity but large variations do occur   Additionally  research indicates that for most non US companies filing with the SEC ROE was historically higher  under IFRS than under US GAAP  
12,654,Comparison of the levels and trends in a company s performance provide information about how the  company performed  The company s management presents its view about causes underlying its  performance in the management commentary or management discussion and analysis  MD A  section of  its annual report and during periodic conference calls with analysts and investors  To gain additional  understanding of the causes underlying a company s performance an analyst can review industry  information or seek information from additional sources such as consumer surveys

2,655,The results of an analysis of past performance provide a basis for reaching conclusions and making  recommendations  For example an analysis undertaken as the basis for a forward looking study might  conclude that a company s future performance is or is not likely to reflect continuation of recent historical  trends  As another example an analysis to support a market based valuation of a company might focus on  whether the company s profitability and growth outlook which is better  worse  than the peer group  median justifies its relatively high  low  valuation  This analysis would consider market multiples such  as price to earnings ratio  P E  price to book ratio and total invested capital to EBITDA  earnings before  interest taxes depreciation and amortization    As another example an analysis undertaken as part of an  evaluation of the management of two companies might result in conclusions about whether one company  has grown as fast as another company or as fast as the industry overall and whether each company has  maintained profitability while growing 
3,655,   APPLICATION  PROJECTING FUTURE FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE
4,655,Projections of future financial performance are used in determining the value of a company or its equity  component  Projections of future financial performance are also used in credit analysis particularly in  project finance or acquisition finance to determine whether a company s cash flows will be adequate to  pay the interest and principal on its debt and to evaluate whether a company will likely remain in  compliance with its financial covenants 
5,655,Sources of data for analysts  projections include some or all of the following  the company s projections  the company s previous financial statements industry structure and outlook and macroeconomic  forecasts 
6,655,Evaluating a company s past performance may provide a basis for forward looking analyses  An  evaluation of a company s business and economic environment and its history may persuade the analyst  that historical information constitutes a valid basis for such analyses and that the analyst s projections  may be based on the continuance of past trends perhaps with some adjustments  Alternatively in the case  of a major acquisition or divestiture for a start up company or for a company operating in a volatile  industry past performance may be less relevant to future performance 
7,655,Projections of a company s near term performance may be used as an input to market based valuation or  relative valuation  i e  valuation based on price multiples   Such projections may involve projecting next  year s sales and using the common size income statement to project major expense items or particular  margins on sales  e g  gross profit margin or operating profit margin   These calculations will then lead to  the development of an income measure for a valuation calculation such as net income earnings per share   EPS  or EBITDA  More complex projections of a company s future performance involve developing a  more detailed analysis of the components of performance for multiple periods for example projections  of sales and gross margin by product line projection of operating expenses based on historical patterns  and projection of interest expense based on requisite debt funding interest rates and applicable taxes   Furthermore a projection should include sensitivity analyses applied to the major assumptions 
8,655,     Projecting Performance  An Input to Market Based Valuation
9,655,One application of financial statement analysis involves projecting a company s near term performance as  an input to market based valuation  For example an analyst might project a company s sales and profit  margin to estimate EPS and then apply a projected P E to establish a target price for the company s stock

2,656,Analysts often take a top down approach to projecting a company s sales   First industry sales are  projected on the basis of their historical relationship with some macroeconomic indicator such as growth  in real gross domestic product  GDP   In researching the automobile industry for example the analyst  may find that the industry s annual domestic unit car sales  number of cars sold in domestic markets   bears a relationship to annual changes in real GDP  Regression analysis is often used to establish the  parameters of such relationships  Other factors in projecting sales may include consumer income or tastes  technological developments and the availability of substitute products or services  After industry sales are  projected a company s market share is projected  Company level market share projections may be based  on historical market share and a forward looking assessment of the company s competitive position  The  company s sales are then estimated as its projected market share multiplied by projected total industry  sales 
3,656,After developing a sales forecast for a company an analyst can choose among various methods for  forecasting income and cash flow  An analyst must decide on the level of detail to consider in developing  forecasts  For example separate forecasts may be made for individual expense items or for more  aggregated expense items such as total operating expenses  Rather than stating a forecast in terms of  expenses the forecast might be stated in terms of a forecasted profit margin  gross operating or net   The  net profit margin in contrast to the gross or operating profit margins is affected by financial leverage and  tax rates which are subject to managerial and legal regulatory revisions  therefore historical data may  sometimes be more relevant for projecting gross or operating profit margins than for projecting net profit  margins  Whatever the margin used the forecasted amount of profit for a given period is the product of  the forecasted amount of sales and the forecast of the selected profit margin 
4,656,As Example   illustrates for relatively mature companies operating in non volatile product markets  historical information on operating profit margins can provide a useful starting point for forecasting future  operating profits  at least over short forecasting horizons   Historical operating profit margins are  typically less reliable for projecting future margins for a new or relatively volatile business or one with  significant fixed costs  which can magnify the volatility of operating margins  
5,656,EXAMPLE  
6,656,Using Historical Operating Profit Margins to  Forecast Operating Profit
7,656,One approach to projecting operating profit is to determine a company s average operating profit  margin over the previous several years and apply that margin to a forecast of the company s sales   Use the following information on three companies to answer Questions   and   below 
8,656,  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   This US health care conglomerate founded in      had       sales of around       billion from its three main businesses  pharmaceuticals medical  devices and diagnostics and consumer products 
9,656,  BHP Billiton  BHP   This company with group headquarters in Australia and secondary  headquarters in London is the world s largest natural resources company reporting revenue  of approximately US      billion for the fiscal year ended June       The company mines  processes and markets coal copper nickel iron bauxite and silver and also has substantial  petroleum operations 
10,656,  Baidu  This Chinese company which was established in      and went public on  NASDAQ in      is the leading Chinese language search engine  The company s revenues  for      were     billion renminbi  RMB  an increase of    percent from      and more  than    times greater than revenues in

2,657,   For each of the three companies state and justify whether the suggested forecasting  method  applying the average operating profit over the previous several years to a  forecast of sales  would be a reasonable starting point for projecting future operating  profit 
3,657,   Assume that the      forecast of sales was perfect and therefore equal to the  realized sales by the company in       Compare the forecast of      operating profit  using an average of the previous four years  operating profit margins with the actual       operating profit reported by the company given the following additional  information 
4,657,  JNJ  For the four years prior to      JNJ s average operating profit margin was  approximately      percent  The company s actual operating profit for      was        billion 
5,657,  BHP  For the four years prior to the year ending June      BHP s average operating profit  margin was approximately      percent  The company s actual operating profit for the year  ended June      was US      billion 
6,657,  Baidu  Over the four years prior to      Baidu s average operating profit margin was  approximately      percent  The company s actual operating profit for      was RMB     billion 
7,657,Using the additional information given state and justify whether actual results support the  usefulness of the stable operating margin assumption 
8,657,Solution to   
9,657,JNJ  Because JNJ is an established company with diversified operations in relatively stable  businesses the suggested approach to projecting the company s operating profit would be a  reasonable starting point 
10,657,BHP  Because commodity prices tend to be volatile and the mining industry is relatively  capital intensive the suggested approach to projecting BHP s operating profit would  probably not be a useful starting point 
11,657,Baidu  A relatively new company such as Baidu has limited operating history on which to  judge stability of margins  The company appears to have been in a period of rapid growth  and is in an industry that has been changing rapidly in recent years  This important aspect  about the company suggests that the broad approach to projecting operating profit would not  be a useful starting point for Baidu 
12,657,Solution to   
13,657,JNJ  JNJ s actual operating profit margin for      was      percent        billion divided  by sales of       billion  which is very close to the company s three year average operating  profit margin of approximately      percent  If the average operating profit margin had been  applied to perfectly forecasted      sales to obtain forecasted operating profit the  forecasting error would have been minimal 
14,657,BHP  BHP s actual operating profit margin for the year ended June      was      percent         billion divided by sales of       billion   If the company s average profit margin of       percent had been applied to perfectly forecasted sales the forecasted operating profit  would have been approximately US      billion around    percent higher than actual  operating profit

2,658,Baidu  Baidu s actual operating profit margin for      was      percent  RMB    billion  divided by sales of RMB    billion   If the average profit margin of      percent had been  applied to perfectly forecasted sales the forecasted operating profit would have been  approximately RMB    billion or around    percent below Baidu s actual operating profit 
3,658,Although prior years  profit margins can provide a useful starting point in projections for companies with  relatively stable business the underlying data should nonetheless be examined to identify items that are  not likely to occur again in the following year s   Such non recurring  i e  transitory  items should be  removed from computations of any profit amount or profit margin that will be used in projections   Example   illustrates this principle

3,660,This item relates to one time restructuring charges aimed at eliminating duplication between the  pre acquisition operations of the two companies  InBev and Anheuser Busch   The restructuring  charges themselves are not directly relevant in forecasting the future net income of the company   If the restructuring successfully reduced the company s cost base however the combined  companies  expenses in the future are likely to be less than the sum of the two individual  companies  expenses  Also if the cost base was successfully reduced the profit margin for the  combined company is likely to be higher than a profit margin calculated as the sum of the  individual companies  profits divided by the sum of the individual companies  sales revenues 
4,660,Discussion of    
5,660,Gains on sales of businesses and assets that result in exceptional income are not a core part of a  company s business  This item should typically not be viewed as an ongoing source of earnings  and should not therefore be a component of forecasts of net income  Additionally any portion of  the company s past income that had been generated by the businesses sold should be excluded  from forecasted net income 
6,660,Discussion of    
7,660,These disclosures pertain to Nestl  s total USD   billion return on the USD    million  investment in Alcon over    years  between      and        The information is not directly  relevant to forecasting future net income  Although forecasts of net income must exclude the  income from the divested business information about the amount of that income is disclosed  elsewhere 
8,660,Discussion of    
9,660,Gains on sales of businesses and assets that result in exceptional income are not a core part of a  company s business so neither the CHF     million gain in      nor any further gains on the  transaction should be included in ongoing long term forecasts  An analyst can however use the  disclosed information about the sale price and information about the net book value of the  investment to estimate the gain that will be reported in      net income  In addition results of  discontinued items should not be included when assessing past performance or when forecasting  future net income  As noted the results of the discontinued items are shown separately on the  income statement as shown in excerpt     
10,660,Discussion of    
11,660,Results of discontinued items should not be included when assessing past performance or when  forecasting future net income  For example the company s EBIT margin  EBIT sales  for  continuing operations for      of    percent should be included in an analysis  not the    percent  for the combined continuing and discontinued operations

14,660,Projections of future financial performance over multiple periods are needed in valuation models that  estimate the value of a company or its equity by discounting future cash flows  The value of a company or  its equity developed in this way can then be compared with its current market price as a basis for  investment decisions

2,661,Projections of future performance are also used for credit analysis  These projections are important in  assessing a borrower s ability to repay interest and principal of debt obligations  Investment  recommendations depend on the needs and objectives of the client and on an evaluation of the risk of the  investment relative to its expected return both of which are a function of the terms of the debt obligation  itself as well as financial market conditions  Terms of the debt obligation include amount interest rate  maturity financial covenants and collateral 
3,661,Example   presents an elementary illustration of net income and cash flow forecasting to illustrate a  format for analysis and some basic principles  In Example   assumptions are shown first  then the  period by period abbreviated financial statement resulting from the assumptions is shown 
4,661,Depending on the use of the forecast an analyst may choose to compute further more specific cash flow  metrics  For example free cash flow to equity which is used in discounted cash flow approaches to  equity valuation can be estimated as net income adjusted for noncash items minus investment in net  working capital and in net fixed assets plus net borrowing

2,663,Example   is simplified to demonstrate some principles of forecasting  In practice each aspect of a  forecast presents a range of challenges  Sales forecasts may be very detailed with separate forecasts for  each year of each product line each geographical and or each business segment  Sales forecasts may be  based on past results  for relatively stable businesses  management forecasts industry studies and or  macroeconomic forecasts  Similarly gross profit margins may be based on past results or forecasted  relationships and may be detailed  Expenses other than cost of goods sold may be broken down into more  detailed line items each of which may be forecasted on the basis of its relationship with sales  if variable   or on the basis of its historical levels  Working capital requirements may be estimated as a proportion of  the amount of sales  as in Example    or the change in sales or as a compilation of specific forecasts for  inventory receivables and payables  Most forecasts will involve some investment in fixed assets in  which case depreciation amounts affect taxable income and net income but not cash flow  Example   makes the simplifying assumption that interest is paid on the beginning of year cash balance 
3,663,Example   develops a series of point estimates for future net income and cash flow  In practice  forecasting generally includes an analysis of the risk in forecasts in this case an assessment of the  impact on income and cash flow if the realized values of variables differ significantly from the  assumptions used in the base case or if actual sales are much different from forecasts  Quantifying the risk  in forecasts requires an analysis of the economics of the company s businesses and expense structure and  the potential impact of events affecting the company the industry and the economy in general  When that  investigation is completed the analyst can use scenario analysis or Monte Carlo simulation to assess risk   Scenario analysis involves specifying assumptions that differ from those used as the base case  assumptions  In Example   the projections of net income and cash flow could be recast in a more  pessimistic scenario with assumptions changed to reflect slower sales growth and higher costs  A Monte  Carlo simulation involves specifying probability distributions of values for variables and random  sampling from those distributions  In the analysis in Example   the projections would be repeatedly  recast with the selected values for the drivers of net income and cash flow thus permitting the analyst to  evaluate a range of possible results and the probability of simulating the possible actual outcomes 
4,663,An understanding of financial statements and ratios can enable an analyst to make more detailed  projections of income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement items  For example an analyst  may collect information on normal inventory and receivables turnover and use this information to forecast  accounts receivable inventory and cash flows based on sales projections rather than use a composite  working capital investment assumption as in Example   
5,663,As the analyst makes detailed forecasts he or she must ensure that the forecasts are consistent with each  other  For instance in Example   the analyst s forecast concerning days of sales outstanding  which is an  estimate of the average time to collect payment from sales made on credit  should flow from a model of  the company that yields a forecast of the change in the average accounts receivable balance  Otherwise  predicted days of sales outstanding and accounts receivable will not be mutually consistent 
6,663,EXAMPLE  
7,663,Consistency of Forecasts
8,663,Brown Corporation had an average days of sales outstanding  DSO  period of    days in        An analyst thinks that Brown s DSO will decline in       because of expected improvements in  the company s collections department  to match the industry average of    days  Total sales  all  on credit  in      were      million and Brown expects total sales  all on credit  to increase to       million in       To achieve the lower DSO the change in the average accounts receivable  balance from      to      that must occur is closest to

2,664,D        million 
3,664,Solution 
4,664,B is correct  The first step is to calculate accounts receivable turnover from the DSO collection  period  Receivable turnover equals         DSO         for      and               in        Next the analyst uses the fact that the average accounts receivable balance equals sales receivable  turnover to conclude that for      average accounts receivable was                              and for      it must equal                              The difference is a  reduction in receivables of          
5,664,The next section illustrates the application of financial statement analysis to credit risk analysis 
6,664,   APPLICATION  ASSESSING CREDIT RISK
7,664,Credit risk is the risk of loss caused by a counterparty s or debtor s failure to make a promised payment   For example credit risk with respect to a bond is the risk that the obligor  the issuer of the bond  will not  be able to pay interest and or principal according to the terms of the bond indenture  contract   Credit  analysis is the evaluation of credit risk  Credit analysis may relate to the credit risk of an obligor in a  particular transaction or to an obligor s overall creditworthiness 
8,664,In assessing an obligor s overall creditworthiness one general approach is credit scoring a statistical  analysis of the determinants of credit default  Credit analysis for specific types of debt  e g  acquisition  financing and other highly leveraged financing  typically involves projections of period by period cash  flows 
9,664,Whatever the techniques adopted the analytical focus of credit analysis is on debt paying ability  Unlike  payments to equity investors payments to debt investors are limited by the agreed contractual interest  If  a company experiences financial success its debt becomes less risky but its success does not increase the  amount of payments to its debtholders  In contrast if a company experiences financial distress it may be  unable to pay interest and principal on its debt obligations  Thus credit analysis has a special concern  with the sensitivity of debt paying ability to adverse events and economic conditions cases in which the  creditor s promised returns may be most at risk  Because those returns are generally paid in cash credit  analysis usually focuses on cash flow rather than accrual income  Typically credit analysts use return  measures related to operating cash flow because it represents cash generated internally which is available  to pay creditors 
10,664,These themes are reflected in Example   which illustrates the application to an industry group of four  groups of quantitative factors in credit analysis      scale and diversification     tolerance for leverage      operational efficiency and     margin stability 
11,664, Scale and diversification  relate to a company s sensitivity to adverse events adverse economic  conditions and other factors such as market leadership purchasing power with suppliers and access to  capital markets that may affect debt paying ability

2,665,Financial policies or  tolerance for leverage  relate to the obligor s ability to service its indebtedness   i e  make the promised payments on debt   In Example   various solvency ratios are used to measure  tolerance for leverage  One set of tolerance for leverage measures is based on retained cash flow  RCF    RCF is defined by Moody s Investors Service as operating cash flow before working capital changes less  dividends  For example under the assumption of no capital expenditures a ratio of RCF to total debt of      indicates that the company may be able to pay off debt from cash flow retained in the business in  approximately           years  at current levels of RCF and debt   a ratio adjusting for capital  expenditures is also used  Other factors include interest coverage ratios based on EBITDA which are also  chosen by Moody s in specifying factors for operational efficiency and margin stability 
3,665, Operational efficiency  as defined by Moody s relates to cost structure  Companies with lower costs are  better positioned to deal with financial stress 
4,665, Margin stability  relates to the past volatility of profit margins  Higher stability should be associated  with lower credit risk 
5,665,EXAMPLE  
6,665,Moody s Evaluation of Quantifiable Rating Factors  for a Specific Industry 
7,665,Moody s considers a number of items when assigning credit ratings for the global aerospace and  defense industry including quantitative measures of three broad factors  size and scale  business  profile revenue sustainability and efficiency  and financial leverage and flexibility  A company s  ratings for each of these factors are weighted and aggregated in determining the overall credit  rating assigned  The broad factors the sub factors and weightings are as follows 
8,665,Broad Factor Size and scale

2,666,   What are some reasons why Moody s may have selected these three broad factors as being  important in assigning a credit rating in the aerospace and defense industry 
3,666,   Why might financial leverage and flexibility be weighted so heavily 
4,666,Solution to   
5,666,Size and scale 
6,666,  Larger size can strengthen negotiating position with customers and suppliers leading  to better contract terms and potential cost savings 
7,666,  Larger scale typically indicates prior success 
8,666,  Larger scale can enhance a company s ability to manage and react to variable market  conditions 
9,666,  Larger scale often indicates greater geographical product and customer  diversification 
10,666,Business profile revenue sustainability and efficiency 
11,666,  A business profile that provides some protection from competition a sustainable flow  of revenues as indicated by a strong order backlog and better operating efficiency  should contribute to higher and more sustainable cash flows 
12,666,Financial leverage and flexibility 
13,666,  Strong financial policies should increase the likelihood of cash flows being sufficient  to service debt 
14,666,Solution to   
15,666,The level of debt relative to earnings and cash flow is a critical factor in assessing  creditworthiness  The higher the current level of debt the higher the risk of default 
16,666,A point to note regarding Example   is that the rating factors and the metrics used to represent each can  vary by industry group  For example for heavy manufacturing  manufacturing of the capital assets used  in other manufacturing and production processes  Moody s distinguishes order trends and quality as  distinctive credit factors affecting future revenues factory load and profitability patterns 
17,666,Analyses of a company s historical and projected financial statements are an integral part of the credit  evaluation process  As noted by Moody s financial statement information is an important source of  information for the rating process 
18,666,Much of the information used in assessing performance for the sub factors is found in or  calculated using the company s financial statements  others are derived from observations or  estimates by the analysts        Moody s ratings are forward looking and incorporate our  expectations for future financial and operating performance  We use both historical and  projected financial results in the rating process  Historical results help us understand patterns  and trends for a company s performance as well as for peer comparison  
19,666,As noted Moody computes a variety of ratios in assessing creditworthiness  A comparison of a  company s ratios with the ratios of its peers is informative in evaluating relative creditworthiness as  demonstrated in Example

2,667,EXAMPLE  
3,667,Peer Comparison of Ratios
4,667,A credit analyst is assessing the efficiency and leverage of two aerospace companies on the basis  of certain sub factors identified by Moody s  The analyst collects the information from the  companies  annual reports and calculates the following ratios  
5,667,EBITDA Average assets Debt EBITDA Retained cash flow to debt Free cash flow to net debt
6,667,Bombardier Inc  BAE Systems plc                                         
7,667,Based solely on the data given which company is more likely to be assigned a higher credit rating  and why 
8,667,Solution 
9,667,The ratio comparisons are all in favor of BAE Systems plc  BAE has a higher level of EBITDA in  relation to average assets higher retained cash flow relative to debt and higher free cash flow to  net debt  BAE also has a lower level of debt relative to EBITDA  Based on the data given  therefore BAE is likely to be assigned a higher credit rating 
10,667,Before calculating ratios such as those presented in Example   rating agencies make certain adjustments  to reported financial statements such as adjusting debt to include off balance sheet debt in a company s  total debt    We will describe in Section   some common adjustments 
11,667,Financial statement analysis especially financial ratio analysis can also be an important tool in selecting  equity investments as discussed in the next section 
12,667,   APPLICATION  SCREENING FOR POTENTIAL  EQUITY INVESTMENTS
13,667,Ratios constructed from financial statement data and market data are often used to screen for potential  equity investments  Screening is the application of a set of criteria to reduce a set of potential  investments to a smaller set having certain desired characteristics  Criteria involving financial ratios  generally involve comparing one or more ratios with some pre specified target or cutoff values 
14,667,A security selection approach incorporating financial ratios may be applied whether the investor uses top  down analysis or bottom up analysis  Top down analysis involves identifying attractive geographical  segments and or industry segments from which the investor chooses the most attractive investments   Bottom up analysis involves selection of specific investments from all companies within a specified  investment universe  Regardless of the direction screening for potential equity investments aims to  identify companies that meet specific criteria  An analysis of this type may be used as the basis for  directly forming a portfolio or it may be undertaken as a preliminary part of a more thorough analysis of  potential investment targets

2,668,Fundamental to this type of analysis are decisions about which metrics to use as screens how many  metrics to include what values of those metrics to use as cutoff points and what weighting to give each  metric  Metrics may include not only financial ratios but also characteristics such as market capitalization  or membership as a component security in a specified index  Exhibit   presents a hypothetical example of  a simple stock screen based on the following criteria  a valuation ratio  P E  less than a specified value a  solvency ratio measuring financial leverage  total debt assets  not exceeding a specified value positive  net income and dividend yield  dividends per share divided by price per share  greater than a specified  value  Exhibit   shows the results of applying the screen in August      to a set of      US companies  with market capitalization greater than      million which compose a hypothetical equity manager s  investment universe 
3,668,Exhibit    Example of a Stock Screen
4,668,Criterion P E     Total debt Assets       Net income Sales     Dividend yield        Meeting all four criteria simultaneously
5,668,Stocks Meeting Criterion Number Percent of Total                                                         
6,668,Source for data  http   google com finance  
7,668,Several points about the screen in Exhibit   are consistent with many screens used in practice 
8,668,  Some criteria serve as checks on the results from applying other criteria  In this hypothetical  example the first criterion selects stocks that appear relatively cheaply valued  The stocks might be  cheap for a good reason however such as poor profitability or excessive financial leverage  So the  requirement for net income to be positive serves as a check on profitability and the limitation on  financial leverage serves as a check on financial risk  Of course financial ratios or other statistics  cannot generally control for exposure to certain other types of risk  e g  risk related to regulatory  developments or technological innovation  
9,668,  If all the criteria were completely independent of each other the set of stocks meeting all four  criteria would be    equal to      times      percent the product of the fraction of stocks  satisfying the four criteria individually  i e                                             or       percent   As the screen illustrates criteria are often not independent and the result is that more  securities pass the screening than if criteria were independent  In this example      or       percent  of the securities pass all four screens simultaneously  For an example of the lack of  independence we note that dividend paying status is probably positively correlated with the ability  to generate positive earnings and the value of the third criterion  If stocks that pass one test tend to  also pass another few are eliminated after the application of the second test 
10,668,  The results of screens can sometimes be relatively concentrated in a subset of the sectors  represented in the benchmark  The financial leverage criterion in Exhibit   would exclude banking  stocks for example  What constitutes a high or low value of a measure of a financial characteristic  can be sensitive to the industry in which a company operates

2,669,Screens can be used by both growth investors  focused on investing in high earnings growth  companies  value investors  focused on paying a relatively low share price in relation to earnings or  assets per share  and market oriented investors  an intermediate grouping of investors whose  investment disciplines cannot be clearly categorized as value or growth   Growth screens would typically  feature criteria related to earnings growth and or momentum  Value screens as a rule feature criteria  setting upper limits for the value of one or more valuation ratios  Market oriented screens would not  strongly emphasize valuation or growth criteria  The use of screens involving financial ratios may be most  common among value investors 
3,669,Many studies have assessed the most effective items of accounting information for screening equity  investments  Some research suggests that certain items of accounting information can help explain  and
4,669,potentially predict  market returns  e g  Chan et al        Lev and Thiagarajan       Lakonishok et al         Davis       Abarbanell and Bushee        Representative of such investigations is Piotroski
5,669,       whose screen uses nine accounting based fundamentals that aim to identify financially strong and  profitable companies among those with high book value market value ratios  For example the  profitability measures relate to whether the company reported positive net income positive cash flow and  an increase in return on assets  ROA  
6,669,An analyst may want to evaluate how a portfolio based on a particular screen would have performed  historically  For this purpose the analyst uses a process known as  back testing   Back testing applies  the portfolio selection rules to historical data and calculates what returns would have been earned if a  particular strategy had been used  The relevance of back testing to investment success in practice  however may be limited  Haugen and Baker        described some of these limitations 
7,669,  Survivorship bias  If the database used in back testing eliminates companies that cease to exist  because of a bankruptcy or merger then the remaining companies collectively will appear to have  performed better 
8,669,  Look ahead bias  If a database includes financial data updated for restatements  where companies  have restated previously issued financial statements to correct errors or reflect changes in  accounting principles    then there is a mismatch between what investors would have actually  known at the time of the investment decision and the information used in the back testing 
9,669,  Data snooping bias  If researchers build a model on the basis of previous researchers  findings then  use the same database to test that model they are not actually testing the model s predictive ability   When each step is backward looking the same rules may or may not produce similar results in the  future  The predictive ability of the model s rules can validly be tested only by using future data   One academic study has argued that the apparent ability of value strategies to generate excess  returns is largely explainable as the result of collective data snooping  Conrad Cooper and Kaul

12,669,Ratio Based Screening for Potential Equity  Investments
13,669,Below are two alternative strategies under consideration by an investment firm 
14,669,Strategy A  Invest in stocks that are components of a global equity index have a ROE above  the median ROE of all stocks in the index and have a P E less than the median P E 
15,669,Strategy B  Invest in stocks that are components of a broad based US equity index have a  ratio of price to operating cash flow in the lowest quartile of companies in the index and  have shown increases in sales for at least the past three years

2,670,   How would you characterize the two strategies 
3,670,   What concerns might you have about using such strategies 
4,670,Solution to   
5,670,Strategy A appears to aim for global diversification and combines a requirement for high relative  profitability with a traditional measure of value  low P E   Strategy B focuses on both large and  small companies in a single market and apparently aims to identify companies that are growing  and have a lower price multiple based on cash flow from operations 
6,670,Solution to   
7,670,The use of any approach to investment decisions depends on the objectives and risk profile of the  investor  With that crucial consideration in mind we note that ratio based benchmarks may be an  efficient way to screen for potential equity investments  In screening however many questions  arise 
8,670,First unintentional selections can be made if criteria are not specified carefully  For example  Strategy A might unintentionally select a loss making company with negative shareholders  equity  because negative net income divided by negative shareholders  equity arithmetically results in a  positive ROE  Strategy B might unintentionally select a company with negative operating cash  flow because price to operating cash flow will be negative and thus very low in the ranking  In  both cases the analyst can add additional screening criteria to avoid unintentional selections  these  additional criteria could include requiring positive shareholders  equity in Strategy A and  requiring positive operating cash flow in Strategy B 
9,670,Second the inputs to ratio analysis are derived from financial statements and companies may  differ in the financial standards they apply  e g  IFRS versus US GAAP  the specific accounting  method s  they choose within those allowed by the reporting standards and or the estimates made  in applying an accounting method 
10,670,Third back testing may not provide a reliable indication of future performance because of  survivorship bias look ahead bias or data snooping bias  Also as suggested by finance theory  and by common sense the past is not necessarily indicative of the future 
11,670,Fourth implementation decisions can dramatically affect returns  For example decisions about  frequency and timing of portfolio re evaluation and changes affect transaction costs and taxes paid  out of the portfolio 
12,670,   ANALYST ADJUSTMENTS TO REPORTED  FINANCIALS
13,670,When comparing companies that use different accounting methods or estimate key accounting inputs in  different ways analysts frequently adjust a company s financials  In this section we first provide a  framework for considering potential analyst adjustments to facilitate such comparisons and then provide  examples of such adjustments  In practice required adjustments vary widely  The examples presented  here are not intended to be comprehensive but rather to illustrate the use of adjustments to facilitate a  meaningful comparison

2,671,     A Framework for Analyst Adjustments
3,671,In this discussion of potential analyst adjustments to a company s financial statements we use a  framework focused on the balance sheet  Because the financial statements are interrelated however  adjustments to items reported on one statement may also be reflected in adjustments to items on another  financial statement  For example an analyst adjustment to inventory on the balance sheet affects cost of  goods sold on the income statement  and thus also affects net income and subsequently the retained  earnings account on the balance sheet  
4,671,Regardless of the particular order in which an analyst considers the items that may require adjustment for  comparability the following aspects are appropriate 
5,671,  Importance  materiality   Is an adjustment to this item likely to affect the conclusions  In other  words does it matter  For example in an industry where companies require minimal inventory  does it matter that two companies use different inventory accounting methods 
6,671,  Body of standards  Is there a difference in the body of standards being used  US GAAP versus  IFRS   If so in which areas is the difference likely to affect a comparison 
7,671,  Methods  Is there a difference in accounting methods used by the companies being compared 
8,671,  Estimates  Is there a difference in important estimates used by the companies being compared 
9,671,The following sections illustrate analyst adjustments first those relating to the asset side of the balance  sheet and then those relating to the liability side 
10,671,     Analyst Adjustments Related to Investments
11,671,Accounting for investments in the debt and equity securities of other companies  other than investments  accounted for under the equity method and investments in consolidated subsidiaries  depends on  management s intention  i e  whether to actively trade the securities make them available for sale or in  the case of debt securities hold them to maturity   When securities are classified as  financial assets  measured at fair value through profit or loss   similar to  trading  securities in US GAAP  unrealized  gains and losses are reported in the income statement  When securities are classified as  financial assets  measured at fair value through other comprehensive income   similar to  available for sale  securities in  US GAAP  unrealized gains and losses are not reported in the income statement and instead are  recognized in equity  If two otherwise comparable companies have significant differences in the  classification of investments analyst adjustments may be useful to facilitate comparison 
12,671,     Analyst Adjustments Related to Inventory
13,671,With inventory adjustments may be required for different accounting methods  As described in previous  readings a company s decision about inventory method will affect the value of inventory shown on the  balance sheet as well as the value of inventory that is sold  cost of goods sold   If a company not reporting  under IFRS   uses LIFO  last in first out  and another uses FIFO  first in first out  comparability of the  financial results of the two companies will suffer  Companies that use the LIFO method must also  however disclose the value of their inventory under the FIFO method  To recast inventory values for a  company using LIFO reporting on a FIFO basis the analyst adds the ending balance of the LIFO reserve  to the ending value of inventory under LIFO accounting  To adjust cost of goods sold to a FIFO basis the  analyst subtracts the change in the LIFO reserve from the reported cost of goods sold under LIFO  accounting  Example    illustrates the use of a disclosure of the value of inventory under the FIFO  method to make a more consistent comparison of the current ratios of two companies reporting in  different methods

2,673,The cost of our inventories is primarily determined using the Last In First Out    LIFO   method  Under the LIFO inventory valuation method changes in the cost of  raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current  period even though these materials and other costs may have been incurred at  significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle   Generally in a period of rising prices LIFO recognizes higher costs of goods sold  which both reduces current income and assigns a lower value to the year end  inventory  Recent proposals have been initiated aimed at repealing the election to use  the LIFO method for income tax purposes  According to these proposals generally  taxpayers that currently use the LIFO method would be required to revalue their LIFO  inventory to its first in first out   FIFO   value  As of June         if the FIFO  method of inventory had been used instead of the LIFO method our inventories  would have been about      million higher  This increase in inventory would result  in a one time increase in taxable income which would be taken into account ratably  over the first taxable year and the following several taxable years  The repeal of LIFO  could result in a substantial tax liability which could adversely impact our cash flows  and financial condition

14,673,To adjust the LIFO inventory to FIFO add the excess amounts of FIFO cost over LIFO cost to  LIFO inventory and increase current assets by an equal amount  The effect of adjusting inventory  on the current ratio is to increase the current ratio from     to     in both      and       CRS has  greater liquidity according to the adjusted current ratio

3,674,The additional tax liability would be greater than the entire amount of the company s cash flow  from operations of        million  the additional tax liability would be apportioned however  over several years 
4,674,In summary the information disclosed by companies that use LIFO allows an analyst to calculate the  value of the company s inventory as if the company were using the FIFO method  In Example    the  portion of inventory valued under the LIFO method was a relatively small portion of total inventory  the  LIFO reserve  excess of FIFO cost over LIFO  was also relatively small  If the LIFO method is used for a  substantial part of a company s inventory and the LIFO reserve is large relative to reported inventory  however the adjustment to a FIFO basis can be important for comparison of the LIFO reporting company  with a company that uses the FIFO method of inventory valuation  Example    illustrates a case in which  such an adjustment would have a major impact on an analyst s conclusions

16,674,After adjusting Company B s inventory to a comparable basis  i e  to a FIFO basis  the  conclusion changes  The following table summarizes the results when Company B s inventory is  left on a LIFO basis and when it is placed on a FIFO basis for comparability with Company A

6,675,The adjustment to place Company B s inventory on a FIFO basis was significant because  Company B was assumed to use LIFO for its entire inventory and its inventory reserve was                       or    percent of its reported inventory 
7,675,As mentioned earlier an analyst can also adjust the cost of goods sold for a company using LIFO to a  FIFO basis by subtracting the change in the amount of the LIFO reserve from cost of goods sold  Such an  adjustment would be appropriate for making profitability comparisons with a company reporting on a  FIFO basis and is important to make when the impact of the adjustment would be material 
8,675,     Analyst Adjustments Related to Property Plant and Equipment
9,675,Management generally has considerable discretion in determination of depreciation expense  Depreciation  expense affects the values of reported net income and reported net fixed assets  Analysts often consider  management s choices related to depreciation as a qualitative factor in evaluating the quality of a  company s financial reporting and in some cases analysts may adjust reported depreciation expense for a  specific analytical purpose 
10,675,The amount of depreciation expense depends on both the accounting method and the estimates used in the  calculations  Companies can use the straight line method an accelerated method or a usage method to  depreciate fixed assets  other than land   The straight line method reports an equal amount of depreciation  expense each period and the expense is computed as the depreciable cost divided by the estimated useful  life of the asset  when acquired an asset s depreciable cost is calculated as its total cost minus its  estimated salvage value   Accelerated methods depreciate the asset more quickly  they apportion a greater  amount of the depreciable cost to depreciation expense in the earlier periods  Usage based methods  depreciate an asset in proportion to its usage  In addition to selecting a depreciation method companies  must estimate an asset s salvage value and useful life to compute depreciation 
11,675,Disclosures required for depreciation often do not facilitate specific adjustments so comparisons of  companies concerning their decisions in depreciating assets are often qualitative and general  The  accounts that are associated with depreciation include the balance sheet accounts for gross property plant  and equipment  PPE  and accumulated depreciation  the income statement amount for depreciation  expense  and the statement of cash flows disclosure of capital expenditure  capex  and asset disposals   The relationships among these items can reveal various pieces of information  Note however that PPE  typically includes a mix of assets with different depreciable lives and salvage values so the items in the  following list reflect general relationships in the total pool of assets 
12,675,  Accumulated depreciation divided by gross PPE from the balance sheet suggests how much of the  useful life of the company s overall asset base has passed 
13,675,  Accumulated depreciation divided by depreciation expense suggests how many years  worth of  depreciation expense have already been recognized  i e  the average age of the asset base

2,676,  Net PPE  net of accumulated depreciation  divided by depreciation expense is an approximate  indicator of how many years of useful life remain for the company s overall asset base 
3,676,  Gross PPE divided by depreciation expense suggests the average life of the assets at installation 
4,676,  Capex divided by the sum of gross PPE plus capex can suggest what percentage of the asset base is  being renewed through new capital investment 
5,676,  Capex in relation to asset disposal provides information on growth of the asset base 
6,676,As Example    shows these relationships can be evaluated for companies in an industry to suggest  differences in their strategies for asset utilization or areas for further investigation 
7,676,EXAMPLE   
8,676,Differences in Depreciation
9,676,An analyst is evaluating the financial statements of two companies in the same industry  The  companies have similar strategies with respect to the use of equipment in manufacturing their  products  The following information is provided  amounts in millions

11,676,Company A Company B                    
12,676,   Based on the information given estimate the average remaining useful lives of the asset  bases of Company A and Company B 
13,676,   Suppose that based on a physical inspection of the companies  plants and other industry  information the analyst believes that the actual remaining useful lives of Company A s and  Company B s assets are roughly equal at    years  Based only on the facts given what  might the analyst conclude about Company B s reported net income 
14,676,Solution to   
15,676,The estimated average remaining useful life of Company A s asset base is    years  calculated as  net PPE divided by depreciation expense or                 years   For Company B the  average remaining useful life of the asset base appears to be far longer    years            
16,676,Solution to   
17,676,If    years were used to calculate Company B s depreciation expense the expense would be      million  i e      million higher than reported  and higher depreciation expense would decrease  net income  The analyst might conclude that Company B s reported net income reflects relatively  more aggressive accounting estimates than estimates reflected in Company A s reported net  income

2,677,     Analyst Adjustments Related to Goodwill
3,677,Goodwill arises when one company purchases another for a price that exceeds the fair value of the net  identifiable assets acquired  Net identifiable assets include current assets fixed assets and certain  intangible assets that have value and meet recognition criteria under accounting standards  A broad range  of intangible assets might require valuation in the context of a business combination for example  brands technology and customer lists  Goodwill is recorded as an asset and essentially represents the  difference between the purchase price and the net identifiable assets  For example assume ParentCo  purchases TargetCo for a purchase price of      million and the fair value of TargetCo s identifiable  assets is      million  which includes the fair values of current assets fixed assets and a recognized  brand   ParentCo will record total assets of      million consisting of      million in identifiable assets   including the fair value of the brand  and      million of goodwill  The goodwill is tested annually for  impairment and if the value of the goodwill is determined to be impaired ParentCo will then reduce the  amount of the asset and report a write off resulting from impairment 
4,677,One of the conceptual difficulties with goodwill arises in comparative financial statement analysis   Consider for example two hypothetical US companies one of which has grown by making an  acquisition and the other of which has grown internally  Assume that the economic value of the two  companies is identical  Each has an identically valuable branded product well trained workforce and  proprietary technology  The company that has grown by acquisition will have recorded the transaction to  acquire the target company and its underlying net assets on the basis of the total consideration paid for the  acquisition  The company that has grown internally will have done so by incurring expenditures for  advertising staff training and research all of which are expensed as incurred under US GAAP  Given the  immediate expensing the value of the internally generated assets is not capitalized onto the balance sheet  and is thus not directly reflected on the company s balance sheet  revenues income and cash flows  should reflect the benefits derived from the investment in the intangible assets   Ratios based on asset  values and or income including profitability ratios  such as ROA  and market value to book value   MV BV    will generally differ for the two companies because of differences in the accounting values  of assets and income related to acquired intangibles and goodwill although by assumption the economic  value of the companies is identical

2,678,As expected each company appears to be selling at a premium to the industry average MV BV of       The companies have similar MV BVs  i e  they are somewhat equally valued relative to the  book value of shareholders  equity  but based solely on MV BV AMTD appears to be a better  value  Marseglia is concerned however because he notes that AMTD has significant amounts of  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  He wonders what the relative value would be if the  MV BV were computed after adjusting book value first to remove goodwill and second to  remove all intangible assets  Book value reduced by all intangible assets  including goodwill  is  known as  tangible book value   The median price tangible book value for the industry is     
3,678,   Compute the MV BV adjusted for goodwill and the price tangible book value for each  company 
4,678,   Which company appears to be a better value based solely on this data   Note that the  MV BV is only one part of a broader analysis  Much more evidence related to the valuations  and the comparability of the companies would be required to reach a conclusion about  whether one company is a better value

18,678,After adjusting for goodwill SCHW appears to be selling for a lower price relative to book value  than does AMTD      versus        Both companies are selling at a premium to the industry  particularly AMTD after adjusting for goodwill 
19,678,SCHW is also selling for a higher multiple than the industry      versus      based on  price tangible book value  AMTD has a negative tangible book value and therefore its  price tangible book value is not meaningful  Based on this interpretation and based solely on this  information Marseglia would conclude that AMTD is relatively more expensive than SCHW

2,679,A number of business activities give rise to obligations that although they are economically liabilities of a  company are not required to be reported on a company s balance sheet  Including such off balance sheet  obligations in a company s liabilities can affect ratios and conclusions based on such ratios  In this  section we describe adjustments to financial statements related to one type of off balance sheet  obligation the operating lease   Note that revised leasing standard IFRS    results in both operating and  financing leases appearing on the lessee s balance sheet  These standards are likely to change or even  eliminate adjustments required for operating leases    
3,679,The rights of a lessee  the party that is leasing some asset  may be similar to the rights of an owner but if  the terms of the lease can be structured so it can be accounted for as an operating lease the lease is treated  like a rental contract and neither the leased asset nor the associated liability is reported on the balance  sheet    The lessee simply records the periodic lease payment as a rental expense in its income statement   In contrast when a company actually owns an asset the asset is shown on the balance sheet together with  any corresponding liability such as financing for the asset  Similarly if a lease is accounted for as a  capital lease essentially equivalent to ownership the leased asset and associated liability appear on the  lessee s balance sheet  Note that under IFRS    a company is required to account for most leases as  capital leases with both an asset and liability recorded on the balance sheet 
4,679,What is of concern to analysts is when a lease conveys to the lessee most of the benefits and risks of  ownership but the lease is accounted for as an operating lease giving rise to off balance sheet financing   International accounting standard setters have stated that the entities should not avoid balance sheet  recording of leases through artificial leasing structures 
5,679,A      report by the US SEC on off balance sheet financing estimates that more than    percent of  companies in the United States report having an operating lease  The SEC estimate of total future lease  payments under operating leases was      trillion over the remaining terms of the leases 
6,679,Because companies are required to disclose in their financial statements the amount and timing of lease  payments an analyst can use this information to answer the question  How would a company s financial  position look if operating lease obligations were included in its total liabilities

2,681,For AMR the present value of the capital lease payments is      million  Exhibit   shows different  assumed streams of payments based on the information given in the note and illustrates the sensitivity of  the analysis to assumptions about the timing of cash flows  Each assumed stream results in a different  implied discount rate on the lease or internal rate of return to the lease  Using the stream of payments  shown in the note and assuming that all of the      million payments indicated for      and thereafter  are made in the year      results in an internal rate of return of       percent  Based on the schedule of  payments shown a more reasonable assumption however is that the      million payments do not all  occur in a single year  One approach to estimating the timing of these payments is to assume that the  payments in      and subsequent years equal the average annual payments in years           of                                              Using this approach we assume payments in      and the  following three years that total the amount shown in the note for      and the internal rate of return of the  capital lease is       percent  Given that lease payments have been generally declining over            another approach is to assume that the amount of the lease payment after      remains constant in  subsequent years at an amount equal to the payment in      until the total amount shown in the note for       is reached  Using this assumption we find the internal rate of return of the capital lease payments is        percent

12,682,We developed discount rate estimates of       percent and       percent  Using a discount rate of        percent the present value of future operating lease payments would be roughly      billion and using a  discount rate of       percent the present value would be around      billion  Because      billion of the  amounts related to operating leases already appear on the balance sheet  as disclosed in the company s  lease note  the value of the future operating lease payments that do not appear on the balance sheet are  estimated to be in the range of       million         million         million to       million          million         million  The lower the assumed discount rate the higher the present value of the  lease payments 
13,682,We now add the present value of the off balance sheet future operating lease payments to the company s  total assets and total debt  Making this adjustment increases the debt to assets ratio to an amount between                                           percent and                                           percent  The discount rates implied by the company s capital lease structure are significantly higher  however than yields on investment grade bonds as of the date of the example  therefore an analyst might  choose to examine the sensitivity of the lease obligation to alternative discount rates

7,683,Based on the information given in Exhibit    and assuming no adjustment to equity discuss how  adjusting for operating leases affects the companies  solvency on the basis of debt debt plus  equity   Assume payments after      occur at the same rate as for       For example for Koller  Semiconductor the payments for      through      would be assumed to be     each year  
8,683,Solution 
9,683,Before the adjustment is made the companies  debt debt plus equity are identical both at       percent  To make the adjustment for operating leases the first step is to calculate the present value  of the operating lease payments  Assuming that payments after      occur at the same rate as for       the analyst finds Koller s payment would be     in           and       The present value  of     discounted for five years at    percent is         MacRae s payment is assumed to be       in each of           and       The present value of      discounted for five years at   percent  is         Calculations for      and      are made in the same manner resulting in the present  values shown in Exhibit

13,683,After the present value of capitalized lease obligations is added to total debt MacRae  Manufacturing s debt debt plus equity is significantly higher at      percent than the debt debt  plus equity of Koller Semiconductor as shown in Exhibit     The higher ratio reflects the impact  of lease obligations on MacRae s solvency as measured by debt debt plus equity

6,684,The adjustment for operating leases essentially treats the transaction as if the asset subject to the operating  lease had been purchased rather than leased  The present value of the capitalized lease obligations is the  amount owed and the amount at which the asset is valued  Further adjustments reflect the reduction of  rent expenses  if the asset is owned rent would not be paid  the related interest expense on the amount  owed and a depreciation expense for the asset  The reduction of rent expense can be estimated as the  average of two years of rent expense  Interest expense is estimated as the interest rate times the present  value of the lease payments  Depreciation is estimated on a straight line basis for the number of years of  future lease payments  As mentioned previously IFRS    requires companies to recognize operating  leases similar to that of capital leases including recording the lease on the balance sheet

2,685,Solution 
3,685,Interest coverage is calculated as EBIT divided by interest  For the adjustments rent expense is  the average of two years of rent  For Koller Semiconductor rent expense is calculated as                 The cost of interest on lease obligations is estimated as the interest rate multiplied by the  present value of the lease payments  For Koller Semiconductor this interest expense is calculated  as               and for MacRae Manufacturing it is calculated as               Depreciation  is estimated on a straight line basis by dividing the present value of lease payments by the number  of years of lease payments  seven years   After the adjustment both companies show a decline in  interest coverage ratio reflecting the increased obligation associated with the operating leases   Also the apparent difference in the coverage between the two companies is larger than it was in

2,686,SUMMARY
3,686,This reading described selected applications of financial statement analysis including the evaluation of  past financial performance the projection of future financial performance the assessment of credit risk  and the screening of potential equity investments  In addition the reading introduced analyst adjustments  to reported financials  In all cases the analyst needs to have a good understanding of the financial  reporting standards under which the financial statements were prepared  Because standards evolve over  time analysts must stay current in order to make good investment decisions 
4,686,The main points in the reading are as follows 
5,686,  Evaluating a company s historical performance addresses not only what happened but also the  causes behind the company s performance and how the performance reflects the company s  strategy 
6,686,  The projection of a company s future net income and cash flow often begins with a top down sales  forecast in which the analyst forecasts industry sales and the company s market share  By  projecting profit margins or expenses and the level of investment in working and fixed capital  needed to support projected sales the analyst can forecast net income and cash flow 
7,686,  Projections of future performance are needed for discounted cash flow valuation of equity and are  often needed in credit analysis to assess a borrower s ability to repay interest and principal of a debt  obligation 
8,686,  Credit analysis uses financial statement analysis to evaluate credit relevant factors including  tolerance for leverage operational stability and margin stability 
9,686,  When ratios constructed from financial statement data and market data are used to screen for  potential equity investments fundamental decisions include which metrics to use as screens how  many metrics to include what values of those metrics to use as cutoff points and what weighting to  give each metric 
10,686,  Analyst adjustments to a company s reported financial statements are sometimes necessary  e g   when comparing companies that use different accounting methods or assumptions   Adjustments  include those related to investments  inventory  property plant and equipment  goodwill  and off  balance sheet financing

12,687,A  is in the commodities business 
13,687,B  operates in a single business segment 
14,687,C  is a large diversified company operating in mature industries 
15,687,   Galambos Corporation had an average receivables collection period of    days in       Galambos  has stated that it wants to decrease its collection period in      to match the industry average of     days  Credit sales in      were      million and analysts expect credit sales to increase to       million in       To achieve the company s goal of decreasing the collection period the change in  the average accounts receivable balance from      to      that must occur is closest to

17,687,B          
18,687,C          
19,687,   Credit analysts are likely to consider which of the following in making a rating recommendation 
20,687,A  Business risk but not financial risk

2,688,   When screening for potential equity investments based on return on equity to control risk an  analyst would be most likely to include a criterion that requires 
3,688,A  positive net income 
4,688,B  negative net income 
5,688,C  negative shareholders  equity 
6,688,   One concern when screening for stocks with low price to earnings ratios is that companies with low  P Es may be financially weak  What criterion might an analyst include to avoid inadvertently  selecting weak companies 
7,688,A  Net income less than zero
8,688,B  Debt to total assets ratio below a certain cutoff point
9,688,C  Current year sales growth lower than prior year sales growth
10,688,   When a database eliminates companies that cease to exist because of a merger or bankruptcy this  can result in 
11,688,A  look ahead bias 
12,688,B  back testing bias

14,688,   In a comprehensive financial analysis financial statements should be 
15,688,A  used as reported without adjustment 
16,688,B  adjusted after completing ratio analysis 
17,688,C  adjusted for differences in accounting standards such as international financial reporting  standards and US generally accepted accounting principles 
18,688,   When comparing a US company that uses the last in first out  LIFO  method of inventory with  companies that prepare their financial statements under international financial reporting standards   IFRS  analysts should be aware that according to IFRS the LIFO method of inventory 
19,688,A  is never acceptable 
20,688,B  is always acceptable 
21,688,C  is acceptable when applied to finished goods inventory only 
22,688,   An analyst is evaluating the balance sheet of a US company that uses last in first out  LIFO   accounting for inventory  The analyst collects the following data

9,689,Average Depreciable Life   years    years   years
10,689,    To compute tangible book value an analyst would 
11,689,A  add goodwill to stockholders  equity 
12,689,B  add all intangible assets to stockholders  equity 
13,689,C  subtract all intangible assets from stockholders  equity 
14,689,    Which of the following is an off balance sheet financing technique  The use of 
15,689,A  capital leases 
16,689,B  operating leases 
17,689,C  the last in first out inventory method 
18,689,    To better evaluate the solvency of a company an analyst would most likely add to total liabilities 
19,689,A  the present value of future capital lease payments 
20,689,B  the total amount of future operating lease payments 
21,689,C  the present value of future operating lease payments 
22,689,SOLUTIONS
23,689,   C is correct  For a large diversified company margin changes in different business segments may  offset each other  Furthermore margins are most likely to be stable in mature industries 
24,689,   C is correct  Accounts receivable turnover is equal to         collection period in days         for       and needs to equal               in      for Galambos to meet its goal  Sales turnover equals  the accounts receivable balance  For                                  and for                                    The difference of         is the increase in receivables needed  for Galambos to achieve its goal

2,690,   C is correct  Credit analysts consider both business risk and financial risk 
3,690,   A is correct  Requiring that net income be positive would eliminate companies that report a positive  return on equity only because both net income and shareholders  equity are negative 
4,690,   B is correct  A lower value of debt total assets indicates greater financial strength  Requiring that a  company s debt total assets be below a certain cutoff point would allow the analyst to screen out  highly leveraged and therefore potentially financially weak companies 
5,690,   C is correct  Survivorship bias exists when companies that merge or go bankrupt are dropped from  the database and only surviving companies remain  Look ahead bias involves using updated  financial information in back testing that would not have been available at the time the decision  was made  Back testing involves testing models in prior periods and is not itself a bias 
6,690,   C is correct  Financial statements should be adjusted for differences in accounting standards  as  well as accounting and operating choices   These adjustments should be made prior to common size  and ratio analysis 
7,690,   A is correct  LIFO is not permitted under IFRS 
8,690,   C is correct  To convert LIFO inventory to FIFO inventory the entire LIFO reserve must be added  back                             
9,690,    C is correct  The company made no additions to or deletions from the fixed asset account during the  year so depreciation expense is equal to the difference in accumulated depreciation at the  beginning of the year and the end of the year or      million  Average age is equal to accumulated  depreciation depreciation expense or               years  Average depreciable life is equal to  ending gross investment depreciation expense                 years 
10,690,    C is correct  Tangible book value removes all intangible assets including goodwill from the  balance sheet 
11,690,    B is correct  Operating leases can be used as an off balance sheet financing technique because  neither the asset nor liability appears on the balance sheet  Inventory and capital leases are reported  on the balance sheet 
12,690,    C is correct  The present value of future operating lease payments would be added to total assets  and total liabilities 
13,690,NOTES
14,690, Pinto et al         describe market based valuation as using price multiples ratios of a stock s market price to some measure  of value per share  e g  price to earnings ratios   Although the valuation method may be used independently of an analysis of a  company s past financial performance such an analysis may provide reasons for differences in companies  price multiples

16,690, In a study of European companies  reconciliations in the last year that reconciliations were required by the SEC Henry Lin  and Yang        found that most of the companies reported IFRS net income higher than US GAAP net income and reported  IFRS shareholders  equity lower than US GAAP shareholders  equity  The result was that    percent of the sample companies        ROE under IFRS was more than   percentage points higher than under US GAAP whereas fewer than    percent of the  sample report ROE more than   percentage points lower

4,691, In calculating financial ratios  values not disclosed in the rating report  Moody s makes various adjustments to the financial  data reported by companies in order to better reflect underlying obligations and or to achieve greater comparability with other  companies in the industry  The adjustments made in calculating ratios for this example do not necessarily correspond exactly to  those calculated by Moody s

9,691,  IFRS     Leases  and FASB ASC Topic      Leases  are effective   January      and for fiscal years beginning after  December         respectively 
10,691,  A lessee classifies a lease as an operating lease if certain guidelines concerning the term of the lease the present value of the  lease payments and the ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term are satisfied  Under US GAAP FASB ASC             Leases  Overall Recognition   specifies the criteria for classification 
11,691,  If the term structure of the capital and operating leases can be assumed to be similar an alternative shortcut way to  estimate the present value of future operating lease payments that do not appear on the balance sheet is to assume that the  relationship between the discounted and undiscounted operating lease payments is approximately the same as the relationship  between the discounted and undiscounted capital lease payments  The discounted capital lease payments of      million as  reported on the balance sheet are      percent of the undiscounted noncurrent capital lease payments of       million         million total minus     million current liabilities   Applying the same relationship to operating lease payments we find that       percent of the undiscounted noncurrent operating lease payments of       million        million total minus        million current  equals      billion somewhat higher than the estimate of the present value of future operating lease payments  given in Exhibit   with a discount rate of       percent
