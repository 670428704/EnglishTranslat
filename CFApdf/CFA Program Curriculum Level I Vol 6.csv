9,12,INTRODUCTION
10,12,Equity fixed  income currency and commodity markets are facilities for trading the  basic assets of an economy  Equity and fixed  income securities are claims on the  assets of a company  Currencies are the monetary units issued by a government or  central bank   Commodities are natural resources  such as oil or gold  These underlying  assets are said to trade in cash markets or spot markets and their prices are some  times referred to as cash prices or spot prices though we usually just refer to them  as stock prices  bond prices  exchange rates  and commodity prices   These markets  exist around the world and receive much attention in the financial and mainstream  media   Hence they are relatively familiar not only to financial experts but also to the  general population

3,13,Somewhat less familiar are the markets for derivatives which are financial  instruments that derive their values from the performance of these basic assets   This  reading is an overview of derivatives   Subsequent readings will explore many aspects  of derivatives and their uses in depth  Among the questions that this first reading will  address are the following     What are the defining characteristics of derivatives     What purposes do derivatives serve for financial market participants     What is the distinction between a forward commitment and a contingent claim     What are forward and futures contracts  In what ways are they alike and in  what ways are they different     What are swaps     What are call and put options and how do they differ from forwards  futures   and swaps     What are credit derivatives and what are the various types of credit derivatives     What are the benefits of derivatives     What are some criticisms of derivatives and to what extent are they well  founded     What is arbitrage and what role does it play in a well  functioning financial  market  This reading is organized as follows   Section   explores the definition and uses of  derivatives and establishes some basic terminology  Section   describes derivatives  markets   Section   categorizes and explains types of derivatives   Sections   and    discuss the benefits and criticisms of derivatives  respectively  Section   introduces  the basic principles of derivative pricing and the concept of arbitrage  Section   pro  vides a summary 
4,13,DERIVATIVES  DEFINITIONS AND USES
5,13,The most common definition of a derivative reads approximately as follows   A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the  performance of an underlying asset   This definition despite being so widely quoted can nonetheless be a bit troublesome   For example it can also describe mutual funds and exchange  traded funds  which would  never be viewed as derivatives even though they derive their values from the values  of the underlying securities they hold  Perhaps the distinction that best characterizes  derivatives is that they usually transform the performance of the underlying asset  before paying it out in the derivatives transaction  In contrast  with the exception of  expense deductions  mutual funds and exchange  traded funds simply pass through the  returns of their underlying securities   This transformation of performance is typically  understood or implicit in references to derivatives but rarely makes its way into the  formal definition  In keeping with customary industry practice this characteristic will  be retained as an implied albeit critical factor distinguishing derivatives from mutual  funds and exchange  traded funds and some other straight pass  through instruments    Also note that the idea that derivatives take their performance from an underlying  asset encompasses the fact that derivatives take their value and certain other char  acteristics from the underlying asset   Derivatives strategies perform in ways that are  derived from the underlying and the specific features of derivatives

1,14,Derivatives  Definitions and Uses
2,14, 
3,14,Derivatives are similar to insurance in that both allow for the transfer of risk  from one party to another  As everyone knows  insurance is a financial contract that  provides protection against loss   The party bearing the risk purchases an insurance  policy which transfers the risk to the other party the insurer for a specified period  of time  The risk itself does not change but the party bearing it does   Derivatives  allow for this same type of transfer of risk   One type of derivative in particular the  put option when combined with a position exposed to the risk  functions almost  exactly like insurance but all derivatives can be used to protect against loss   Of course  an insurance contract must specify the underlying risk  such as property health or  life  Likewise so do derivatives   As noted earlier derivatives are associated with an  underlying asset   As such the so  called  underlying asset  is often simply referred  to as the underlying whose value is the source of risk    In fact  the underlying need  not even be an asset itself  Although common derivatives underlyings are equities   fixed  income securities  currencies  and commodities  other derivatives underlyings  include interest rates  credit  energy weather and even other derivatives  all of which  are not generally thought of as assets   Thus  like insurance derivatives pay off on the  basis of a source of risk  which is often but not always  the value of an underlying asset   And like insurance derivatives have a definite life span and expire on a specified date  Derivatives are created in the form of legal contracts   They involve two parties the  buyer and the seller  sometimes known as the writer  each of whom agrees to do  something for the other either now or later  The buyer who purchases the derivative  is referred to as the long or the holder because he owns  holds  the derivative and  holds a long position  The seller is referred to as the short because he holds a short  position   A derivative contract always defines the rights and obligations of each party  These  contracts are intended to be and almost always are recognized by the legal system  as commercial contracts that each party expects to be upheld and supported in the  legal system  Nonetheless  disputes sometimes arise and lawyers  judges  and juries  may be required to step in and resolve the matter  There are two general classes of derivatives   Some provide the ability to lock in a  price at which one might buy or sell the underlying   Because they force the two parties  to transact in the future at a previously agreed  on price these instruments are called  forward commitments  The various types of forward commitments are called forward  contracts  futures contracts  and swaps   Another class of derivatives provides the right  but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying at a pre  determined price  Because  the choice of buying or selling versus doing nothing depends on a particular random  outcome these derivatives are called contingent claims  The primary contingent  claim is called an option  The types of derivatives will be covered in more detail later  in this reading and in considerably more depth later in the curriculum  The existence of derivatives begs the obvious question of what purpose they serve   If one can participate in the success of a company by holding its equity what reason  can possibly explain why another instrument is required that takes its value from the  performance of the equity  Although equity and other fundamental markets exist  and usually perform reasonably well without derivative markets  it is possible that  derivative markets can improve the performance of the markets for the underlyings    As you will see later in this reading  that is indeed true in practice 
4,14,  Unfortunately English financial language often evolves without regard to the rules of proper usage   Underlying is typically an adjective and therefore a modifier but the financial world has turned it into a noun    In the financial world the long always benefits from an increase in the value of the instrument he owns   and the short always benefits from a decrease in the value of the instrument he has sold  Think of the long  as having possession of something and the short as having incurred an obligation to deliver that something  
1,15, 
2,15,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,15,Derivative markets create beneficial opportunities that do not exist in their absence   Derivatives can be used to create strategies that cannot be implemented with the  underlyings alone  For example derivatives make it easier to go short  thereby ben  efiting from a decline in the value of the underlying   In addition derivatives  in and  of themselves  are characterized by a relatively high degree of leverage meaning that  participants in derivatives transactions usually have to invest only a small amount of  their own capital relative to the value of the underlying   As such small movements  in the underlying can lead to fairly large movements in the amount of money made  or lost on the derivative  Derivatives generally trade at lower transaction costs than  comparable spot market transactions  are often more liquid than their underlyings   and offer a simple effective and low  cost way to transfer risk   For example a share  holder of a company can reduce or even completely eliminate the market exposure  by trading a derivative on the equity  Holders of fixed  income securities can use  derivatives to reduce or completely eliminate interest rate risk  allowing them to  focus on the credit risk   Alternatively holders of fixed  income securities can reduce  or eliminate the credit risk  focusing more on the interest rate risk   Derivatives permit  such adjustments easily and quickly  These features of derivatives are covered in more  detail later in this reading   The types of performance transformations facilitated by derivatives allow market  participants to practice more effective risk management   Indeed the entire field of  derivatives  which at one time was focused mostly on the instruments themselves   is now more concerned with the uses of the instruments   Just as a carpenter uses a  hammer nails  screws  a screwdriver and a saw to build something useful or beautiful  a financial expert uses derivatives to manage risk   And just as it is critically important  that a carpenter understand how to use these tools  an investment practitioner must  understand how to properly use derivatives   In the case of the carpenter the result is  building something useful  in the case of the financial expert  the result is managing  financial risk   Thus  like tools  derivatives serve a valuable purpose but like tools  they  must be used carefully  The practice of risk management has taken a prominent role in financial mar  kets   Indeed whenever companies announce large losses from trading  lending  or  operations  stories abound about how poorly these companies managed risk   Such  stories are great attention grabbers and a real boon for the media  but they often miss  the point that risk management does not guarantee that large losses will not occur   Rather risk management is the process by which an organization or individual defines  the level of risk it wishes to take  measures the level of risk it is taking and adjusts  the latter to equal the former  Risk management never offers a guarantee that large  losses will not occur and it does not eliminate the possibility of total failure  To do so  would typically require that the amount of risk taken be so small that the organization  would be effectively constrained from pursuing its primary objectives   Risk taking is  inherent in all forms of economic activity and life in general  The possibility of failure  is never eliminated

2,16, 
3,16,A An underlying B A low degree of leverage C Two parties a buyer and a seller   Which of the following statements about derivatives is not true  A They are created in the spot market   B They are used in the practice of risk management   C They take their values from the value of something else 
4,16,Solution to   
5,16,C is correct   Mutual funds and government bonds are not derivatives   A gov  ernment bond is a fundamental asset on which derivatives might be created  but it is not a derivative itself  A mutual fund can technically meet the definition  of a derivative but as noted in the reading  derivatives transform the value of a  payoff of an underlying asset   Mutual funds merely pass those payoffs through  to their holders  
6,16,Solution to   
7,16,B is correct   All derivatives have an underlying and must have a buyer and a  seller  More importantly derivatives have high degrees of leverage not low  degrees of leverage 
8,16,Solution to   
9,16,A is correct   Derivatives are used to practice risk management and they take   derive  their values from the value of something else the underlying   They are  not created in the spot market  which is where the underlying trades  
10,16,Note also that risk management is a dynamic and ongoing process  reflecting the  fact that the risk assumed can be difficult to measure and is constantly changing    As noted derivatives are tools  indeed the tools that make it easier to manage risk    Although one can trade stocks and bonds  the underlyings  to adjust the level of risk   it is almost always more effective to trade derivatives   Risk management is addressed more directly elsewhere in the CFA curriculum  but the study of derivatives necessarily entails the concept of risk management   In  an explanation of derivatives  the focus is usually on the instruments and it is easy to  forget the overriding objective of managing risk   Unfortunately that would be like a  carpenter obsessed with his hammer and nails  forgetting that he is building a piece of  furniture  It is important to always try to keep an eye on the objective of managing risk  
11,16,THE STRUCTURE OF DERIVATIVE MARKETS
12,16,Having an understanding of equity fixed  income and currency markets is extremely  beneficial indeed quite necessary in understanding derivatives   One could hardly  consider the wisdom of using derivatives on a share of stock if one did not understand  the equity markets reasonably well  As you likely know equities trade on organized  exchanges as well as in over  the  counter  OTC  markets   These exchange  traded  equity markets such as the Deutsche B rse the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the  New York Stock Exchange and its Eurex affiliate are formal organizational structures  that bring buyers and sellers together through market makers  or dealers  to facilitate  transactions   Exchanges have formal rule structures and are required to comply with  all securities laws  
13,16, 
1,17,  
2,17,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,17,OTC securities markets operate in much the same manner with similar rules   regulations  and organizational structures   At one time the major difference between  OTC and exchange markets for securities was that the latter brought buyers and sell  ers together in a physical location whereas the former facilitated trading strictly in  an electronic manner  Today these distinctions are blurred because many organized  securities exchanges have gone completely to electronic systems   Moreover OTC  securities markets can be formally organized structures  such as NASDAQ or can  merely refer to informal networks of parties who buy and sell with each other such  as the corporate and government bond markets in the United States   The derivatives world also comprises organized exchanges and OTC markets    Although the derivatives world is also moving toward less distinction between these  markets  there are clear differences that are important to understand 
4,17,    Exchange  Traded Derivatives Markets
5,17,Derivative instruments are created and traded either on an exchange or on the OTC  market   Exchange  traded derivatives are standardized whereas OTC derivatives are  customized  To standardize a derivative contract means that its terms and conditions  are precisely specified by the exchange and there is very limited ability to alter those  terms   For example an exchange might offer trading in certain types of derivatives  that expire only on the third Friday of March June September and December  If a  party wanted the derivative to expire on any other day it would not be able to trade  such a derivative on that exchange nor would it be able to persuade the exchange to  create it  at least not in the short run  If a party wanted a derivative on a particular  entity such as a specific stock  that party could trade it on that exchange only if the  exchange had specified that such a derivative could trade  Even the magnitudes of  the contracts are specified  If a party wanted a derivative to cover         and the  exchange specified that contracts could trade only in increments of         the  party could do nothing about it if it wanted to trade that derivative on that exchange  This standardization of contract terms facilitates the creation of a more liquid  market for derivatives   If all market participants know that derivatives on the euro  trade in         unit lots and that they all expire only on certain days  the market  functions more effectively than it would if there were derivatives with many differ  ent unit sizes and expiration days competing in the same market at the same time   This standardization makes it easier to provide liquidity  Through designated market  makers  derivatives exchanges guarantee that derivatives can be bought and sold   The cornerstones of the exchange  traded derivatives market are the market makers   or dealers  and the speculators  both of whom typically own memberships on the  exchange   The market makers stand ready to buy at one price and sell at a higher  price  With standardization of terms and an active market  market makers are often  able to buy and sell almost simultaneously at different prices  locking in small short   term profits a process commonly known as scalping   In some cases  however they  are unable to do so thereby forcing them to either hold exposed positions or find  other parties with whom they can trade and thus lay off  get rid of   the risk   This is
6,17,  It is important to understand that merely being able to buy and sell a derivative or even a security does  not mean that liquidity is high and that the cost of liquidity is low  Derivatives exchanges guarantee that a  derivative can be bought and sold but they do not guarantee the price  The ask price  the price at which  the market maker will sell  and the bid price  the price at which the market maker will buy  can be far  apart  which they will be in a market with low liquidity  Hence such a market can have liquidity loosely  defined but the cost of liquidity can be quite high  The factors that can lead to low liquidity for derivatives  are similar to those for securities   little trading interest and a high level of uncertainty    Exchanges are owned by their members whose memberships convey the right to trade  In addition  some exchanges are themselves publicly traded corporations whose members are shareholders  and there  are also non  member shareholders  
1,18,The Structure of Derivative Markets
2,18,  
3,18,when speculators come in  Although speculators are market participants who are  willing to take risks  it is important to understand that being a speculator does not  mean the reckless assumption of risk   Although speculators will take large losses at  times  good speculators manage those risks by watching their exposures  absorbing  market information and observing the flow of orders in such a manner that they are  able to survive and profit   Often speculators will hedge their risks when they become  uncomfortable  Standardization also facilitates the creation of a clearing and settlement opera  tion  Clearing refers to the process by which the exchange verifies the execution of a  transaction and records the participants  identities   Settlement refers to the related  process in which the exchange transfers money from one participant to the other  or from a participant to the exchange or vice versa   This flow of money is a critical  element of derivatives trading   Clearly there would be no confidence in markets in  which money is not efficiently collected and disbursed  Derivatives exchanges have  done an excellent job of clearing and settlement especially in comparison to securities  exchanges   Derivatives exchanges clear and settle all contracts overnight  whereas  most securities exchanges require two business days   The clearing and settlement process of derivative transactions also provides a credit  guarantee  If two parties engage in a derivative contract on an exchange one party will  ultimately make money and the other will lose money  Derivatives exchanges use their  clearinghouses to provide a guarantee to the winning party that if the loser does not  pay the clearinghouse will pay the winning party  The clearinghouse is able to provide  this credit guarantee by requiring a cash deposit  usually called the margin bond or  performance bond from the participants to the contract  Derivatives clearinghouses  manage these deposits  occasionally requiring additional deposits  so effectively that  they have never failed to pay in the nearly     years they have existed  We will say  more about this process later and illustrate how it works   Exchange markets are said to have transparency which means that full information  on all transactions is disclosed to exchanges and regulatory bodies   All transactions  are centrally reported within the exchanges and their clearinghouses  and specific laws  require that these markets be overseen by national regulators   Although this would  seem a strong feature of exchange markets  there is a definite cost   Transparency  means a loss of privacy   National regulators can see what transactions have been  done  Standardization means a loss of flexibility   A participant can do only the trans  actions that are permitted on the exchange  Regulation means a loss of both privacy  and flexibility  It is not that transparency or regulation is good and the other is bad   It is simply a trade  off  Derivatives exchanges exist in virtually every developed  and some emerging  market  countries around the world  Some exchanges specialize in derivatives and  others are integrated with securities exchanges   Although there have been attempts to create somewhat non  standardized deriva  tives for trading on an exchange such attempts have not been particularly successful   Standardization is a critical element by which derivatives exchanges are able to pro  vide their services   We will look at this point again when discussing the alternative  to standardization  customized OTC derivatives  
4,18,    Over  the  Counter Derivatives Markets
5,18,The OTC derivatives markets comprise an informal network of market participants  that are willing to create and trade virtually any type of derivative that can legally exist   The backbone of these markets is the set of dealers  which are typically banks   Most  of these banks are members of a group called the International Swaps and Derivatives  Association  ISDA  a worldwide organization of financial institutions that engage in  derivative transactions  primarily as dealers   As such these markets are sometimes
1,19,  
2,19,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,19,called dealer markets  Acting as principals  these dealers informally agree to buy and  sell various derivatives   It is informal because the dealers are not obligated to do so   Their participation is based on a desire to profit  which they do by purchasing at one  price and selling at a higher price  Although it might seem that a dealer who can  buy  low sell high  could make money easily the process in practice is not that simple   Because OTC instruments are not standardized a dealer cannot expect to buy a  derivative at one price and simultaneously sell it to a different party who happens to  want to buy the same derivative at the same time and at a higher price  To manage the risk they assume by buying and selling customized derivatives  OTC  derivatives dealers typically hedge their risks by engaging in alternative but similar  transactions that pass the risk on to other parties   For example if a company comes to  a dealer to buy a derivative on the euro the company would effectively be transferring  the risk of the euro to the dealer  The dealer would then attempt to lay off  get rid  of   that risk by engaging in an alternative but similar transaction that would transfer  the risk to another party  This hedge might involve another derivative on the euro or  it might simply be a transaction in the euro itself  Of course that begs the question  of why the company could not have laid off the risk itself and avoided the dealer   Indeed some can and do but laying off risk is not simple  Unable to find identical  offsetting transactions  dealers usually have to find similar transactions with which  they can lay off the risk   Hedging one derivative with a different kind of derivative  on the same underlying is a similar but not identical transaction  It takes specialized  knowledge and complex models to be able to do such transactions effectively and  dealers are more capable of doing so than are ordinary companies   Thus  one might  think of a dealer as a middleman a sort of financial wholesaler using its specialized  knowledge and resources to facilitate the transfer of risk   In the same manner that one  could theoretically purchase a consumer product from a manufacturer a network of  specialized middlemen and retailers is often a more effective method  Because of the customization of OTC derivatives  there is a tendency to think  that the OTC market is less liquid than the exchange market   That is not necessarily  true  Many OTC instruments can easily be created and then essentially offset by  doing the exact opposite transaction often with the same party  For example sup  pose Corporation A buys an OTC derivative from Dealer B  Before the expiration  date Corporation A wants to terminate the position  It can return to Dealer B and  ask to sell a derivative with identical terms   Market conditions will have changed of  course and the value of the derivative will not be the same but the transaction can  be conducted quite easily with either Corporation A or Dealer B netting a gain at the  expense of the other  Alternatively Corporation A could do this transaction with a  different dealer the result of which would remove exposure to the underlying risk but  would leave two transactions open and some risk that one party would default to the  other  In contrast to this type of OTC liquidity some exchange  traded derivatives have  very little trading interest and thus relatively low liquidity  Liquidity is always driven  by trading interest  which can be strong or weak in both types of markets   OTC derivative markets operate at a lower degree of regulation and oversight than  do exchange  traded derivative markets   In fact  until around      it could largely  be said that the OTC market was essentially unregulated  OTC transactions could  be executed with only the minimal oversight provided through laws that regulated  the parties themselves  not the specific instruments   Following the financial crisis  that began in      new regulations began to blur the distinction between OTC  and exchange  listed markets   In both the United States  the Wall Street Reform  and Consumer Protection Act of      commonly known as the Dodd Frank Act   and Europe  the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC  Derivatives  Central Counterparties  and Trade Repositories  regulations are changing  the characteristics of OTC markets  
1,20,The Structure of Derivative Markets
2,20,  
3,20,When the full implementation of these new laws takes place a number of OTC  transactions will have to be cleared through central clearing agencies  information on  most OTC transactions will need to be reported to regulators  and entities that operate  in the OTC market will be more closely monitored  There are however quite a few  exemptions that cover a significant percentage of derivative transactions   Clearly the  degree of OTC regulation although increasing in recent years  is still lighter than that  of exchange  listed market regulation  Many transactions in OTC markets will retain  a degree of privacy with lower transparency and most importantly the OTC markets  will remain considerably more flexible than the exchange  listed markets

7,20,Solution to   
8,20,C is correct   Exchange  traded contracts are standardized meaning that the  exchange determines the terms of the contract except the price  The exchange  guarantees against default and requires margins or performance bonds  
9,20,Solution to   
10,20,C is correct  OTC derivatives have a lower degree of transparency than exchange   listed derivatives   Trading does not occur in a central location but rather is quite  dispersed  Although new national securities laws are tightening the regulation  of OTC derivatives  the degree of regulation is less than that of exchange  listed  derivatives

8,21,TYPES OF DERIVATIVES
9,21,As previously stated derivatives fall into two general classifications   forward com  mitments and contingent claims   The factor that distinguishes forward commitments  from contingent claims is that the former obligate the parties to engage in a trans  action at a future date on terms agreed upon in advance whereas the latter provide  one party the right but not the obligation to engage in a future transaction on terms  agreed upon in advance 
10,21,    Forward Commitments
11,21,Forward commitments are contracts entered into at one point in time that require  both parties to engage in a transaction at a later point in time  the expiration  on  terms agreed upon at the start   The parties establish the identity and quantity of  the underlying  the manner in which the contract will be executed or settled when  it expires  and the fixed price at which the underlying will be exchanged  This fixed  price is called the forward price  As a hypothetical example of a forward contract  suppose that today Markus and  Johannes enter into an agreement that Markus will sell his BMW to Johannes for a  price of         The transaction will take place on a specified date say     days from  today  At that time Markus will deliver the vehicle to Johannes s home and Johannes  will give Markus a bank  certified check for         There will be no recourse so if  the vehicle has problems later Johannes cannot go back to Markus for compensation   It should be clear that both Markus and Johannes must do their due diligence and  carefully consider the reliability of each other  The car could have serious quality  issues and Johannes could have financial problems and be unable to pay the          Obviously the transaction is essentially unregulated  Either party could renege on his  obligation in response to which the other party could go to court  provided a formal  contract exists and is carefully written  Note finally that one of the two parties is likely  to end up gaining and the other losing  depending on the secondary market price of  this type of vehicle at expiration of the contract   This example is quite simple but illustrates the essential elements of a forward  contract   In the financial world such contracts are very carefully written with legal  provisions that guard against fraud and require extensive credit checks   Now let us  take a deeper look at the characteristics of forward contracts  
12,21,      Forward Contracts
13,21,The following is the formal definition of a forward contract  
1,22,Types of Derivatives
2,22,  
3,22,A forward contract is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two  parties agree that one party the buyer will purchase an underlying asset  from the other party the seller at a later date at a fixed price they agree on  when the contract is signed  In addition to agreeing on the price at which the underlying asset will be sold at  a later date the two parties also agree on several other matters  such as the specific  identity of the underlying  the number of units of the underlying that will be delivered  and where the future delivery will occur  These are important points but relatively  minor in this discussion so they can be left out of the definition to keep it uncluttered  As noted earlier a forward contract is a commitment   Each party agrees that it  will fulfill its responsibility at the designated future date  Failure to do so constitutes  a default and the non  defaulting party can institute legal proceedings to enforce per  formance  It is important to recognize that although either party could default to the  other only one party at a time can default   The party owing the greater amount could  default to the other but the party owing the lesser amount cannot default because  its claim on the other party is greater  The amount owed is always based on the net  owed by one party to the other  To gain a better understanding of forward contracts  it is necessary to examine  their payoffs   As noted forward contracts and indeed all derivatives take  derive   their payoffs from the performance of the underlying asset   To illustrate the payoff of  a forward contract  start with the assumption that we are at time t     and that the  forward contract expires at a later date time t   T   The spot price of the underlying  asset at time   is S  and at time T is ST  Of course when we initiate the contract at  time   we do not know what ST will ultimately be  Remember that the two parties   the buyer and the seller are going long and short  respectively  At time t     the long and the short agree that the short will deliver the asset to  the long at time T for a price of F  T   The notation F  T  denotes that this value is  established at time   and applies to a contract expiring at time T  F  T  is the forward  price  Later you will learn how the forward price is determined  It turns out that it is  quite easy to do but we do not need to know right now   So let us assume that the buyer enters into the forward contract with the seller  for a price of F  T  with delivery of one unit of the underlying asset to occur at time  T  Now let us roll forward to time T when the price of the underlying is ST  The long  is obligated to pay F  T  for which he receives an asset worth ST  If ST   F  T  it is  clear that the transaction has worked out well for the long   He paid F  T  and receives  something of greater value  Thus  the contract effectively pays off ST   F  T  to the  long  which is the value of the contract at expiration  The short has the mirror image  of the long   He is required to deliver the asset worth ST and accept a smaller amount   F  T   The contract has a payoff for him of F  T    ST which is negative  Even if the  asset s value ST is less than the forward price F  T  the payoffs are still ST   F  T   for the long and F  T    ST for the short   We can consolidate these results by writing  the short s payoff as the negative of the long  s    ST   F  T   which serves as a useful  reminder that the long and the short are engaged in a zero  sum game which is a  type of competition in which one participant s gains are the other  s losses   Although  both lose a modest amount in the sense of both having some costs to engage in the
4,22,  Such notations as t     and t   T are commonly used in explaining derivatives   To indicate that t      simply means that we initiate a contract at an imaginary time designated like a counter starting at zero   To indicate that the contract expires at t   T simply means that at some future time designated as T the  contract expires   Time T could be a certain number of days from now or a fraction of a year later or T  years later  We will be more specific in later readings that involve calculations   For now just assume that  t     and t   T are two dates the initiation and the expiration of the contract     This point is covered more fully elsewhere in the readings on derivatives  but we will see it briefly later  in this reading

3,23,transaction these costs are relatively small and worth ignoring for our purposes at this  time  In addition it is worthwhile to note how derivatives transform the performance  of the underlying   The gain from owning the underlying would be ST   S  whereas the  gain from owning the forward contract would be ST   F  T   Both figures are driven  by ST the price of the underlying at expiration but they are not the same  Exhibit   illustrates the payoffs from both buying and selling a forward contract

14,23,The long hopes the price of the underlying will rise above the forward price F  T   whereas the short hopes the price of the underlying will fall below the forward price   Except in the extremely rare event that the underlying price at T equals the forward  price there will ultimately be a winner and a loser  An important element of forward contracts is that no money changes hands  between parties when the contract is initiated  Unlike in the purchase and sale of an  asset  there is no value exchanged at the start   The buyer does not pay the seller some  money and obtain something   In fact  forward contracts have zero value at the start    They are neither assets nor liabilities   As you will learn in later readings  their values  will deviate from zero later as prices move  Forward contracts will almost always have  non  zero values at expiration 
1,24,Types of Derivatives
2,24,  
3,24,As noted previously the primary purpose of derivatives is for risk management    Although the uses of forward contracts are covered in depth later in the curriculum  there are a few things to note here about the purposes of forward contracts   It should  be apparent that locking in the future buying or selling price of an underlying asset  can be extremely attractive for some parties   For example an airline anticipating the  purchase of jet fuel at a later date can enter into a forward contract to buy the fuel at  a price agreed upon when the contract is initiated  In so doing  the airline has hedged  its cost of fuel  Thus  forward contracts can be structured to create a perfect hedge  providing an assurance that the underlying asset can be bought or sold at a price  known when the contract is initiated  Likewise speculators  who ultimately assume  the risk laid off by hedgers  can make bets on the direction of the underlying asset  without having to invest the money to purchase the asset itself  Finally forward contracts need not specifically settle by delivery of the underlying  asset  They can settle by an exchange of cash  These contracts called non  deliverable
4,24,forwards  NDFs  cash  settled forwards or contracts for differences have the same
5,24,economic effect as do their delivery  based counterparts   For example for a physical  delivery contract  if the long pays F  T  and receives an asset worth ST the contract  is worth ST   F  T  to the long at expiration  A non  deliverable forward contract  would have the short simply pay cash to the long in the amount of ST   F  T   The  long would not take possession of the underlying asset  but if he wanted the asset   he could purchase it in the market for its current price of ST  Because he received a  cash settlement in the amount of ST   F  T  in buying the asset the long would have  to pay out only ST    ST   F  T   which equals F  T   Thus  the long could acquire  the asset  effectively paying F  T  exactly as the contract promised  Transaction costs  do make cash settlement different from physical delivery but this point is relatively  minor and can be disregarded for our purposes here  As previously mentioned forward contracts are OTC contracts   There is no for  mal forward contract exchange  Nonetheless  there are exchange  traded variants of  forward contracts  which are called futures contracts or just futures  
6,24,      Futures
7,24,Futures contracts are specialized versions of forward contracts that have been stan  dardized and that trade on a futures exchange  By standardizing these contracts and  creating an organized market with rules  regulations  and a central clearing facility  the futures markets offer an element of liquidity and protection against loss by default  Formally a futures contract is defined as follows   A futures contract is a standardized derivative contract created and traded  on a futures exchange in which two parties agree that one party the buyer  will purchase an underlying asset from the other party the seller at a later  date and at a price agreed on by the two parties when the contract is initi  ated and in which there is a daily settling of gains and losses and a credit  guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse   First  let us review what standardization means   Recall that in forward contracts   the parties customize the contract by specifying the underlying asset  the time to  expiration the delivery and settlement conditions  and the quantity of the underly  ing  all according to whatever terms they agree on  These contracts are not traded  on an exchange  As noted the regulation of OTC derivatives markets is increasing   but these contracts are not subject to the traditionally high degree of regulation that  applies to securities and futures markets   Futures contracts first require the existence  of a futures exchange a legally recognized entity that provides a market for trading  these contracts   Futures exchanges are highly regulated at the national level in all  countries   These exchanges specify that only certain contracts are authorized for  trading   These contracts have specific underlying assets  times to expiration delivery
1,25,  
2,25,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,25,and settlement conditions  and quantities   The exchange offers a facility in the form  of a physical location and or an electronic system as well as liquidity provided by  authorized market makers   Probably the most important distinctive characteristic of futures contracts is the  daily settlement of gains and losses and the associated credit guarantee provided by the  exchange through its clearinghouse  When a party buys a futures contract  it commits  to purchase the underlying asset at a later date and at a price agreed upon when the  contract is initiated  The counterparty  the seller  makes the opposite commitment an  agreement to sell the underlying asset at a later date and at a price agreed upon when  the contract is initiated  The agreed  upon price is called the futures price  Identical  contracts trade on an ongoing basis at different prices  reflecting the passage of time  and the arrival of new information to the market   Thus  as the futures price changes   the parties make and lose money  Rising  falling  prices  of course benefit  hurt  the  long and hurt  benefit  the short   At the end of each day the clearinghouse engages  in a practice called mark to market also known as the daily settlement  The clear  inghouse determines an average of the final futures trades of the day and designates  that price as the settlement price  All contracts are then said to be marked to the  settlement price  For example if the long purchases the contract during the day at a  futures price of      and the settlement price at the end of the day is      the long  s  account would be marked for a gain of     In other words  the long has made a profit  of    and that amount is credited to his account  with the money coming from the  account of the short  who has lost     Naturally if the futures price decreases  the  long loses money and is charged with that loss  and the money is transferred to the  account of the short    The account is specifically referred to as a margin account   Of course in equity  markets  margin accounts are commonly used but there are significant differences  between futures margin accounts and equity margin accounts   Equity margin accounts  involve the extension of credit   An investor deposits part of the cost of the stock  and borrows the remainder at a rate of interest   With futures margin accounts  both  parties deposit a required minimum sum of money but the remainder of the price  is not borrowed  This required margin is typically less than     of the futures price  which is considerably less than in equity margin trading   In the example above let  us assume that the required margin is     which is referred to as the initial margin   Both the long and the short put that amount into their respective margin accounts    This money is deposited there to support the trade not as a form of equity with the  remaining amount borrowed  There is no formal loan created as in equity markets    A futures margin is more of a performance bond or good faith deposit  terms that  were previously mentioned  It is simply an amount of money put into an account that  covers possible future losses   Associated with each initial margin is another figure called the maintenance  margin  The maintenance margin is the amount of money that each participant must  maintain in the account after the trade is initiated and it is always significantly lower  than the initial margin  Let us assume that the maintenance margin in this example is      If the buyer  s account is marked to market with a credit of    his margin balance  moves to     while the seller  s account is charged    and his balance moves to      The clearinghouse then compares each participant s balance with the maintenance  margin  At this point  both participants more than meet the maintenance margin 
4,25,  The actual amount of money charged and credited depends on the contract size and the number of  contracts   A price of      might actually refer to a contract that has a standard size of          Thus        might actually mean      of the standard size or          In addition the parties are likely to hold  more than one contract   Hence the gain of    referred to in the text might really mean             minus       times the         standard size  times the number of contracts held by the party 
1,26,Types of Derivatives
2,26,  
3,26,Let us say however that the price continues to move in the long  s favor and  therefore against the short   A few days later assume that the short s balance falls to     which is below the maintenance margin requirement of     The short will then  get a margin call which is a request to deposit additional funds   The amount that  the short has to deposit  however is not the    that would bring his balance up to  the maintenance margin  Instead the short must deposit enough funds to bring the  balance up to the initial margin  So the short must come up with     The purpose  of this rule is to get the party  s position significantly above the minimum level and  provide some breathing room  If the balance were brought up only to the mainte  nance level there would likely be another margin call soon  A party can choose not  to deposit additional funds  in which case the party would be required to close out  the contract as soon as possible and would be responsible for any additional losses  until the position is closed  As with forward contracts  neither party pays any money to the other when the  contract is initiated  Value accrues as the futures price changes  but at the end of each  day the mark  to  market process settles the gains and losses  effectively resetting the  value for each party to zero  The clearinghouse moves money between the participants  crediting gains to the  winners and charging losses to the losers   By doing this on a daily basis  the gains and  losses are typically quite small and the margin balances help ensure that the clearing  house will collect from the party losing money  As an extra precaution in fast  moving  markets  the clearinghouse can make margin calls during the day not just at the end  of the day  Yet there still remains the possibility that a party could default   A large loss  could occur quickly and consume the entire margin balance with additional money  owed   If the losing party cannot pay the clearinghouse provides a guarantee that it  will make up the loss  which it does by maintaining an insurance fund  If that fund  were depleted the clearinghouse could levy a tax on the other market participants   though that has never happened  Some futures contracts contain a provision limiting price changes   These rules   called price limits establish a band relative to the previous day  s settlement price within  which all trades must occur  If market participants wish to trade at a price above the  upper band trading stops  which is called limit up until two parties agree on a trade  at a price lower than the upper limit   Likewise if market participants wish to trade  at a price below the lower band which is called limit down no trade can take place  until two parties agree to trade at a price above the lower limit   When the market hits  these limits and trading stops  it is called locked limit  Typically the exchange rules  provide for an expansion of the limits the next day  These price limits  which may be  somewhat objectionable to proponents of free markets  are important in helping the  clearinghouse manage its credit exposure  Just because two parties wish to trade a  futures contract at a price beyond the limits does not mean they should be allowed to  do so  The clearinghouse is a third participant in the contract  guaranteeing to each  party that it ensures against the other party defaulting   Therefore the clearinghouse  has a vested interest in the price and considerable exposure  Sharply moving prices  make it more difficult for the clearinghouse to collect from the parties losing money  Most participants in futures markets buy and sell contracts  collecting their  profits and incurring their losses  with no ultimate intent to make or take delivery of  the underlying asset   For example the long may ultimately sell her position before  expiration  When a party re  enters the market at a later date but before expiration and
4,26,  For example let us go back to when the short had a balance of    which is    below the maintenance  margin and    below the initial margin  The short will get a margin call but suppose he elects not to deposit  additional funds and requests that his position be terminated  In a fast  moving market  the price might  increase more than    before his broker can close his position  The remaining balance of    would then  be depleted and the short would be responsible for any additional losses

3,27,engages in the opposite transaction a long selling her previously opened contract  or a short buying her previously opened contract the transaction is referred to as  an offset   The clearinghouse marks the contract to the current price relative to the  previous settlement price and closes out the participant s position  At any given time the number of outstanding contracts is called the open interest   Each contract counted in the open interest has a long and a corresponding short   The  open interest figure changes daily as some parties open up new positions  while other  parties offset their old positions   It is theoretically possible that all longs and shorts  offset their positions before expiration leaving no open interest when the contract  expires  but in practice there is nearly always some open interest at expiration at  which time there is a final delivery or settlement   When discussing forward contracts  we noted that a contract could be written such  that the parties engage in physical delivery or cash settlement at expiration  In the  futures markets  the exchange specifies whether physical delivery or cash settlement  applies   In physical delivery contracts  the short is required to deliver the underlying  asset at a designated location and the long is required to pay for it   Delivery replaces  the mark  to  market process on the final day  It also ensures an important principle that  you will use later   The futures price converges to the spot price at expiration  Because  the short delivers the actual asset and the long pays the current spot price for it  the  futures price at expiration has to be the spot price at that time  Alternatively a futures  contract initiated right at the instant of expiration is effectively a spot transaction and  therefore the futures price at expiration must equal the spot price  Following this logic  in cash settlement contracts  there is a final mark to market  with the futures price  formally set to the spot price thereby ensuring automatic convergence  In discussing forward contracts  we described the process by which they pay off as  the spot price at expiration minus the forward price ST   F  T  the former determined  at expiration and the latter agreed upon when the contract is initiated  Futures contracts  basically pay off the same way but there is a slight difference  Let us say the contract  is initiated on Day   and expires on Day T  The intervening days are designated Days        T  The initial futures price is designated f  T  and the daily settlement prices  on Days       T are designated f  T  f  T    fT T   There are of course futures  prices within each trading day but let us focus only on the settlement prices for now   For simplicity let us assume that the long buys at the settlement price on Day   and  holds the position all the way to expiration  Through the mark  to  market process  the  cash flows to the account of the long will be

3,28,day  to  day basis   Naturally the time value of money principle says that these are not  equivalent amounts of money  But the differences tend to be small particularly in  low  interest  rate environments  some of these amounts are gains and some are losses   and most futures contracts have maturities of less than a year  But the near equivalence of the profits from a futures and a forward contract dis  guises an important distinction between these types of contracts   In a forward contact  with the entire payoff made at expiration a loss by one party can be large enough to  trigger a default   Hence forward contracts are subject to default and require careful  consideration of the credit quality of the counterparties   Because futures contracts  settle gains and collect losses daily the amounts that could be lost upon default are  much smaller and naturally give the clearinghouse much greater flexibility to manage  the credit risk it assumes   Unlike forward markets  futures markets are highly regulated at the national level   National regulators are required to approve new futures exchanges and even new  contracts proposed by existing exchanges as well as changes in margin requirements   price limits  and any significant changes in trading procedures   Violations of futures  regulations can be subject to governmental prosecution  In addition futures markets  are far more transparent than forward markets   Futures prices  volume and open  interest are widely reported and easily obtained  Futures prices of nearby expiring  contracts are often used as proxies for spot prices  particularly in decentralized spot  markets  such as gold which trades in spot markets all over the world  In spite of the advantages of futures markets over forward markets  forward mar  kets also have advantages over futures markets   Transparency is not always a good  thing   Forward markets offer more privacy and fewer regulatory encumbrances   In  addition forward markets offer more flexibility  With the ability to tailor contracts to  the specific needs of participants  forward contracts can be written exactly the way  the parties want   In contrast  the standardization of futures contracts makes it more  difficult for participants to get exactly what they want even though they may get close  substitutes   Yet  futures markets offer a valuable credit guarantee  Like forward markets  futures markets can be used for hedging or speculation  For  example a jewelry manufacturer can buy gold futures  thereby hedging the price it  will have to pay for one of its key inputs   Although it is more difficult to construct a  futures strategy that hedges perfectly than to construct a forward strategy that does so  futures offer the benefit of the credit guarantee  It is not possible to argue that futures  are better than forwards or vice versa   Market participants always trade off advantages  against disadvantages   Some participants prefer futures  and some prefer forwards    Some prefer one over the other for certain risks and the other for other risks   Some  might use one for a particular risk at a point in time and a different instrument for  the same risk at another point in time  The choice is a matter of taste and constraints   The third and final type of forward commitment we will cover is swaps   They go a  step further in committing the parties to buy and sell something at a later date  They  obligate the parties to a sequence of multiple purchases and sales  
4,28,      Swaps
5,28,The concept of a swap is that two parties exchange  swap  a series of cash flows   One  set of cash flows is variable or floating and will be determined by the movement of an  underlying asset or rate  The other set of cash flows can be variable and determined  by a different underlying asset or rate or it can be fixed  Formally a swap is defined  as follows  
1,29,  
2,29,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,29,A swap is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two parties agree  to exchange a series of cash flows whereby one party pays a variable series  that will be determined by an underlying asset or rate and the other party  pays either     a variable series determined by a different underlying asset  or rate or     a fixed series  As with forward contracts  swap contracts also contain other terms such as the  identity of the underlying  the relevant payment dates  and the payment procedure  that are negotiated between the parties and written into the contract   A swap is a bit  more like a forward contract than a futures contract in that it is an OTC contract  so  it is privately negotiated and subject to default   Nonetheless  the similarities between  futures and forwards apply to futures and swaps and indeed combinations of futures  contracts expiring at different dates are often compared to swaps   As with forward contracts  either party can default but only one party can default  at a particular time  The money owed is always based on the net owed by one party to  the other  Hence the party owing the lesser amount cannot default to the party owing  the greater amount   Only the latter can default  and the amount it owes is the net of  what it owes and what is owed to it  which is also true with forwards   Swaps are relatively young financial instruments  having been created only in the  early     s   Thus  it may be somewhat surprising to learn that the swap is the most  widely used derivative a likely result of its simplicity and embracement by the cor  porate world  The most common swap is the fixed  for  floating interest rate swap   In fact  this type of swap is so common that it is often called a  plain vanilla swap   or just a  vanilla swap  owing to the notion that vanilla ice cream is considered plain   albeit tasty   Let us examine a scenario in which the vanilla interest rate swap is frequently  used  Suppose a corporation borrows from a bank at a floating rate  It would prefer  a fixed rate which would enable it to better anticipate its cash flow needs in making  its interest payments     The corporation can effectively convert its floating  rate loan  to a fixed  rate loan by adding a swap as shown in Exhibit

3,30,The interest payments on the loan are tied to a specific floating rate  For a dollar   based loan that rate has typically been US dollar Libor    The payments would be based  on the rate from the Libor market on a specified reset date times the loan balance  times a factor reflecting the number of days in the current interest calculation period   The actual payment is made at a later date  Thus  for a loan balance of say     million  with monthly payments  the rate might be based on Libor on the first business day of  the month with interest payable on the first business day of the next month which  is the next reset date and calculated as     million times the rate times         The         convention an implicit assumption of    days in a month is common but  only one of many interest calculation conventions used in the financial world  Often       is replaced by the exact number of days since the last interest payment   The use  of a      day year is a common assumption in the financial world which originated  in the pre  calculator days when an interest rate could be multiplied by a number like                       etc  more easily than if     were used  Whatever the terms of the loan are the terms of the swap are typically set to  match those of the loan  Thus  a Libor  based loan with monthly payments based on  the        convention would be matched with a swap with monthly payments based  on Libor and the        convention and the same reset and payment dates   Although  the loan has an actual balance  the amount owed by borrower to creditor  the swap  does not have such a balance owed by one party to the other  Thus  it has no principal  but it does have a balance of sorts  called the notional principal which ordinarily  matches the loan balance  A loan with only one principal payment  the final one will  be matched with a swap with a fixed notional principal  An amortizing loan which  has a declining principal balance will be matched with a swap with a pre  specified  declining notional principal that matches the loan balance  As with futures and forwards  no money changes hands at the start   thus  the value  of a swap when initiated must be zero  The fixed rate on the swap is determined by  a process that forces the value to zero a procedure that will be covered later in the  curriculum  As market conditions change the value of a swap will deviate from zero  being positive to one party and negative to the other  As with forward contracts  swaps are subject to default  but because the notional  amount of a swap is not typically exchanged the credit risk of a swap is much less  than that of a loan    The only money passing from one party to the other is the net  difference between the fixed and floating interest payments   In fact  the parties do  not even pay each other  Only one party pays the other as determined by the net of  the greater amount owed minus the lesser amount   This does not mean that swaps  are not subject to a potentially large amount of credit risk   At a given point in time  one party could default  effectively owing the value of all remaining payments  which  could substantially exceed the value that the non  defaulting party owes to the default  ing party  Thus  there is indeed credit risk in a swap  This risk must be managed by  careful analysis before the transaction and by the potential use of such risk  mitigating  measures as collateral 
4,30,   Recall that US dollar Libor  London Interbank Offered Rate  is the estimated rate on a dollar  based loan  made by one London bank to another  Such a loan takes the form of a time deposit known as a Eurodollar  because it represents a dollar deposited in a European bank account   In fact  Libor is the same as the so   called Eurodollar rate  The banks involved can be British banks or British branches of non  British banks    The banks estimate their borrowing rates  and a single average rate is assembled and reported each day   That rate is then commonly used to set the rate on many derivative contracts      It is possible that the notional principal will be exchanged in a currency swap whereby each party  makes a series of payments to the other in different currencies   Whether the notional principal is exchanged  depends on the purpose of the swap  This point will be covered later in the curriculum  At this time you  should see that it would be fruitless to exchange notional principals in an interest rate swap because that  would mean each party would give the other the same amount of money when the transaction is initiated  and re  exchange the same amount of money when the contract terminates  
1,31,  
2,31,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,31,There are also interest rate swaps in which one party pays on the basis of one interest  rate and the other party pays on the basis of a different interest rate  For example one  party might make payments at Libor whereas the other might make payments on the  basis of the U  S  Treasury bill rate  The difference between Libor and the T  bill rate  often called the TED spread  T  bills versus Eurodollar  is a measure of the credit risk  premium of London banks  which have historically borrowed short term at Libor  versus that of the U  S  government  which borrows short term at the T  bill rate  This  transaction is called a basis swap  There are also swaps in which the floating rate is  set as an average rate over the period in accordance with the convention for many  loans   Some swaps  called overnight indexed swaps  are tied to a Fed funds type rate  reflecting the rate at which banks borrow overnight   As we will cover later there are  many other different types of swaps that are used for a variety of purposes   The plain  vanilla swap is merely the simplest and most widely used  Because swaps  forwards  and futures are forward commitments  they can all  accomplish the same thing   One could create a series of forwards or futures expiring  at a set of dates that would serve the same purpose as a swap  Although swaps are  better suited for risks that involve multiple payments  at its most fundamental level a  swap is more or less just a series of forwards and acknowledging the slight differences  discussed above more or less just a series of futures  
4,31,EXAMPLE  
5,31,Forward Contracts Futures Contracts and Swaps
6,31,  Which of the following characterizes forward contracts and swaps but not  futures  A They are customized  B They are subject to daily price limits   C Their payoffs are received on a daily basis     Which of the following distinguishes forwards from swaps  A Forwards are OTC instruments  whereas swaps are exchange traded  B Forwards are regulated as futures  whereas swaps are regulated as  securities   C Swaps have multiple payments  whereas forwards have only a single  payment     Which of the following occurs in the daily settlement of futures contracts  A  Initial margin deposits are refunded to the two parties   B Gains and losses are reported to other market participants   C Losses are charged to one party and gains credited to the other 
7,31,Solution to   
8,31,A is correct   Forwards and swaps are OTC contracts and therefore are cus  tomized  Futures are exchange traded and therefore are standardized  Some  futures contracts are subject to daily price limits and their payoffs are received  daily but these characteristics are not true for forwards and swaps  
9,31,Solution to   
10,31,C is correct   Forwards and swaps are OTC instruments and both are regulated  as such  Neither is regulated as a futures contract or a security  A swap is a  series of multiple payments at scheduled dates  whereas a forward has only one  payment  made at its expiration date 
1,32,  
2,32,Types of Derivatives
3,32,Solution to   
4,32,C is correct   Losses and gains are collected and distributed to the respective  parties   There is no specific reporting of these gains and losses to anyone else   Initial margin deposits are not refunded and in fact  additional deposits may  be required 
5,32,This material completes our introduction to forward commitments   All forward  commitments are firm contracts   The parties are required to fulfill the obligations they  agreed to  The benefit of this rigidity is that neither party pays anything to the other  when the contract is initiated  If one party needs some flexibility however it can get it  by agreeing to pay the other party some money when the contract is initiated  When  the contract expires  the party who paid at the start has some flexibility in deciding  whether to buy the underlying asset at the fixed price  Thus  that party did not actually  agree to do anything   It had a choice  This is the nature of contingent claims  
6,32,    Contingent Claims
7,32,A contingent claim is a derivative in which the outcome or payoff is dependent on  the outcome or payoff of an underlying asset   Although this characteristic is also  associated with forward commitments  a contingent claim has come to be associated  with a right but not an obligation to make a final payment contingent on the perfor  mance of the underlying   Given that the holder of the contingent claim has a choice  the term contingent claim has become synonymous with the term option  The holder  has a choice of whether or not to exercise the option  This choice creates a payoff that  transforms the underlying payoff in a more pronounced manner than does a forward  futures  or swap  Those instruments provide linear payoffs   As the underlying goes up   down  the derivative gains  loses   The further up  down  the underlying goes  the  more the derivative gains  loses   Options are different in that they limit losses in one  direction  In addition options can pay off as the underlying goes down  Hence they  transform the payoffs of the underlying into something quite different  
8,32,      Options
9,32,We might say that an option as a contingent claim grants the right but not the  obligation to buy an asset at a later date and at a price agreed on when the option is  initiated  But there are so many variations of options that we cannot settle on this  statement as a good formal definition  For one thing  options can also grant the right  to sell instead of the right to buy  Moreover they can grant the right to buy or sell  earlier than at expiration  So let us see whether we can combine these points into an  all  encompassing definition of an option  An option is a derivative contract in which one party the buyer pays a  sum of money to the other party the seller or writer and receives the right  to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific  expiration date or at any time prior to the expiration date   Unfortunately even that definition does not cover every unique aspect of options    For example options can be created in the OTC market and customized to the terms of  each party or they can be created and traded on options exchanges and standardized   As with forward contracts and swaps  customized options are subject to default  are  less regulated and are less transparent than exchange  traded derivatives   Exchange   traded options are protected against default by the clearinghouse of the options  exchange and are relatively transparent and regulated at the national level  As noted  in the definition above options can be terminated early or at their expirations   When
1,33,  
2,33,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,33,an option is terminated either early or at expiration the holder of the option chooses  whether to exercise it   If he exercises it  he either buys or sells the underlying asset   but he does not have both rights   The right to buy is one type of option referred to as  a call or call option whereas the right to sell is another type of option referred to as  a put or put option  With one very unusual and advanced exception that we do not  cover an option is either a call or a put  and that point is made clear in the contract   An option is also designated as exercisable early  before expiration  or only at  expiration  Options that can be exercised early are referred to as American  style   Options that can be exercised only at expiration are referred to as European  style  It  is extremely important that you do not associate these terms with where these options  are traded  Both types of options trade on all continents     As with forwards and futures  an option can be exercised by physical delivery or  cash settlement  as written in the contract   For a call option with physical delivery  upon exercise the underlying asset is delivered to the call buyer who pays the call  seller the exercise price  For a put option with physical delivery upon exercise the  put buyer delivers the underlying asset to the put seller and receives the strike price   For a cash settlement option exercise results in the seller paying the buyer the cash  equivalent value as if the asset were delivered and paid for  The fixed price at which the underlying asset can be purchased is called the exer  cise price  also called the  strike price  the  strike  or the  striking price    This price  is somewhat analogous to the forward price because it represents the price at which  the underlying will be purchased or sold if the option is exercised  The forward price  however is set in the pricing of the contract such that the contract value at the start  is zero  The strike price of the option is chosen by the participants   The actual price  or value of the option is an altogether different concept   As noted the buyer pays the writer a sum of money called the option premium  or just the  premium   It represents a fair price of the option and in a well  functioning  market it would be the value of the option  Consistent with everything we know about  finance it is the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be received by the  holder of the option during the life of the option  At this point  we will not get into  how this price is determined but you will learn that later  For now there are some  fundamental concepts you need to understand which form a basis for understanding  how options are priced and why anyone would use an option  Because the option buyer  the long  does not have to exercise the option beyond  the initial payment of the premium there is no obligation of the long to the short    Thus  only the short can default  which would occur if the long exercises the option  and the short fails to do what it is supposed to do  Thus  in contrast to forwards and  swaps  in which either party could default to the other default in options is possible  only from the short to the long   Ruling out the possibility of default for now let us examine what happens when  an option expires   Using the same notation used previously let ST be the price of the  underlying at the expiration date T and X be the exercise price of the option  Remember  that a call option allows the holder or long  to pay X and receive the underlying   It  should be obvious that the long would exercise the option at expiration if ST is greater  than X meaning that the underlying value is greater than what he would pay to obtain  the underlying   Otherwise he would simply let the option expire  Thus  on the expi  ration date the option is described as having a payoff of Max  ST   X   Because the  holder of the option would be entitled to exercise it and claim this amount  it also  represents the value of the option at expiration  Let us denote that value as cT  Thus

5,34,which is read as  take the maximum of either zero or ST   X   Thus  if the underlying  value exceeds the exercise price  ST   X  then the option value is positive and equal  to ST   X  The call option is then said to be in the money  If the underlying value is  less than the exercise price  ST   X  then ST   X is negative  zero is greater than a  negative number so the option value would be zero  When the underlying value is less  than the exercise price the call option is said to be out of the money  When ST   X  the call option is said to be at the money although at the money is  for all practical  purposes  out of the money because the value is still zero  This payoff amount is also the value of the option at expiration  It represents value  because it is what the option is worth at that point   If the holder of the option sells it  to someone else an instant before expiration it should sell for that amount because  the new owner would exercise it and capture that amount   To the seller the value of  the option at that point is  Max  ST   X  which is negative to the seller if the option  is in the money and zero otherwise  Using the payoff value and the price paid for the option we can determine the  profit from the strategy which is denoted with the Greek symbol    Let us say the  buyer paid c  for the option at time    Then the profit is

21,36,The put buyer has a limited loss  and although the gain is limited by the fact that  the underlying value cannot go below zero the put buyer does gain more the lower  the value of the underlying   In this manner we see how a put option is like insurance   Bad outcomes for the underlying trigger a payoff for both the insurance policy and  the put  whereas good outcomes result only in loss of the premium  The put seller  like the insurer has a limited gain and a loss that is larger the lower the value of the  underlying   As with call options  these graphs must be considered carefully because  they do not indicate the frequency with which gains and losses will occur  At this  point  it should be apparent that buying a call option is consistent with a bullish point  of view and buying a put option is consistent with a bearish point of view  Moreover  in contrast to forward commitments  which have payoffs that are linearly related to  the payoffs of the underlying  note the straight lines in Exhibit    contingent claims  have payoffs that are non  linear in relation to the underlying   There is linearity over  a range say from   to X or from X upward or downward but over the entire range  of values for the underlying  the payoffs of contingent claims cannot be depicted with  a single straight line

3,37,We have seen only a snapshot of the payoff and profit graphs that can be created  with options   Calls can be combined with puts  the underlying asset  and other calls  or puts with different expirations and exercise prices to create a diverse set of payoff  and profit graphs  some of which are covered later in the curriculum  Before leaving options  let us again contrast the differences between options and  forward commitments   With forward commitments  the parties agree to trade an  underlying asset at a later date and at a price agreed upon when the contract is ini  tiated  Neither party pays any cash to the other at the start   With options  the buyer  pays cash to the seller at the start and receives the right  but not the obligation to  buy  if a call  or sell  if a put  the underlying asset at expiration at a price agreed upon   the exercise price  when the contract is initiated  In contrast to forwards  futures   and swaps  options do have value at the start   the premium paid by buyer to seller   That premium pays for the right eliminating the obligation to trade the underlying  at a later date as would be the case with a forward commitment   Although there are numerous variations of options  most have the same essential  features described here  There is  however a distinctive family of contingent claims  that emerged in the early     s and became widely used and in some cases  heavily  criticized  These instruments are known as credit derivatives  
4,37,      Credit Derivatives
5,37,Credit risk is surely one of the oldest risks known to mankind  Human beings have  been lending things to each other for thousands of years  and even the most primitive  human beings must have recognized the risk of lending some of their possessions to  their comrades   Until the last    years or so however the management of credit risk  was restricted to simply doing the best analysis possible before making a loan moni  toring the financial condition of the borrower during the loan limiting the exposure  to a given party and requiring collateral  Some modest forms of insurance against  credit risk have existed for a number of years  but insurance can be a slow and cum  bersome way of protecting against credit loss   Insurance is typically highly regulated  and insurance laws are usually very consumer oriented  Thus  credit insurance as a  financial product has met with only modest success   In the early     s  however the development of the swaps market led to the  creation of derivatives that would hedge credit risk   These instruments came to be  known as credit derivatives and they avoided many of the regulatory constraints of  the traditional insurance industry  Here is a formal definition  A credit derivative is a class of derivative contracts between two parties  a credit protection buyer and a credit protection seller in which the latter  provides protection to the former against a specific credit loss  One of the first credit derivatives was a total return swap in which the underlying  is typically a bond or loan in contrast to say a stock or stock index   The credit protec  tion buyer offers to pay the credit protection seller the total return on the underlying  bond  This total return consists of all interest and principal paid by the borrower plus  any changes in the bond s market value  In return the credit protection seller typically  pays the credit protection buyer either a fixed or a floating rate of interest   Thus  if  the bond defaults  the credit protection seller must continue to make its promised  payments  while receiving a very small return or virtually no return from the credit  protection buyer  If the bond incurs a loss  as it surely will if it defaults  the credit  protection seller effectively pays the credit protection buyer  Another type of credit derivative is the credit spread option in which the under  lying is the credit  yield  spread on a bond which is the difference between the bond s  yield and the yield on a benchmark default  free bond  As you will learn in the fixed   income material the credit spread is a reflection of investors  perception of credit risk    Because a credit spread option requires a credit spread as the underlying  this type of
1,38,Types of Derivatives
2,38,  
3,38,derivative works only with a traded bond that has a quoted price  The credit protection  buyer selects the strike spread it desires and pays the option premium to the credit  protection seller  At expiration the parties determine whether the option is in the  money by comparing the bond s yield spread with the strike chosen and if it is  the  credit protection seller pays the credit protection buyer the established payoff  Thus   this instrument is essentially a call option in which the underlying is the credit spread  A third type of credit derivative is the credit  linked note  CLN   With this deriv  ative the credit protection buyer holds a bond or loan that is subject to default risk   the underlying reference security  and issues its own security  the credit  linked note   with the condition that if the bond or loan it holds defaults  the principal payoff on  the credit  linked note is reduced accordingly  Thus  the buyer of the credit  linked note  effectively insures the credit risk of the underlying reference security  These three types of credit derivatives have had limited success compared with  the fourth type of credit derivative the credit default swap  CDS   The credit default  swap in particular has achieved much success by capturing many of the essential  features of insurance while avoiding the high degree of consumer regulations that are  typically associated with traditional insurance products   In a CDS one party the credit protection buyer who is seeking credit protection  against a third party makes a series of regularly scheduled payments to the other  party the credit protection seller  The seller makes no payments until a credit event  occurs   A declaration of bankruptcy is clearly a credit event  but there are other types  of credit events  such as a failure to make a scheduled payment or an involuntary  restructuring   The CDS contract specifies what constitutes a credit event  and the  industry has a procedure for declaring credit events  though that does not guarantee  the parties will not end up in court arguing over whether something was or was not  a credit event   Formally a credit default swap is defined as follows   A credit default swap is a derivative contract between two parties a credit  protection buyer and a credit protection seller in which the buyer makes a  series of cash payments to the seller and receives a promise of compensation  for credit losses resulting from the default of a third party  A CDS is conceptually a form of insurance  Sellers of CDSs  oftentimes banks or  insurance companies  collect periodic payments and are required to pay out if a loss  occurs from the default of a third party  These payouts could take the form of resti  tution of the defaulted amount or the party holding the defaulting asset could turn  it over to the CDS seller and receive a fixed amount   The most common approach  is for the payout to be determined by an auction to estimate the market value of the  defaulting debt   Thus  CDSs effectively provide coverage against a loss in return for  the protection buyer paying a premium to the protection seller thereby taking the  form of insurance against credit loss   Although insurance contracts have certain legal  characteristics that are not found in credit default swaps  the two instruments serve  similar purposes and operate in virtually the same way   payments made by one party  in return for a promise to cover losses incurred by the other  Exhibit    illustrates the typical use of a CDS by a lender  The lender is exposed  to the risk of non  payment of principal and interest   The lender lays off this risk by  purchasing a CDS from a CDS seller  The lender now the CDS buyer promises  to make a series of periodic payments to the CDS seller who then stands ready to  compensate the CDS buyer for credit losses

11,39,Clearly the CDS seller is betting on the borrower  s not defaulting or more gen  erally as insurance companies operate that the total payouts it is responsible for  are less than the total payments collected  Of course most insurance companies are  able to do this by having reliable actuarial statistics  diversifying their risk  and selling  some of the risk to other insurance companies   Actuarial statistics are typically quite  solid  Average claims for life health and casualty insurance are well documented and  insurers can normally set premiums to cover losses and operate at a reasonable profit    Although insurance companies try to manage some of their risks at the micro level   e g   charging smokers more for life and health insurance  most of their risk man  agement is at the macro level wherein they attempt to make sure their risks are not  concentrated  Thus  they avoid selling too much homeowners insurance to individuals  in tornado  prone areas   If they have such an exposure they can use the reinsurance  market to sell some of the risk to other companies that are not overexposed to that  risk   Insurance companies attempt to diversify their risks and rely on the principle of  uncorrelated risks  which plays such an important role in portfolio management   A  well  diversified insurance company like a well  diversified portfolio should be able to  earn a return commensurate with its assumed risk in the long run  Credit default swaps should operate the same way  Sellers of CDSs should recognize  when their credit risk is too concentrated  When that happens  they become buyers of  CDSs from other parties or find other ways to lay off the risk   Unfortunately during  the financial crisis that began in      many sellers of CDSs failed to recognize the  high correlations among borrowers whose debt they had guaranteed  One well  known  CDS seller AIG is a large and highly successful traditional insurance company that  got into the business of selling CDSs   Many of these CDSs insured against mortgages    With the growth of the subprime mortgage market  many of these CDS   insured  mortgages had a substantial amount of credit risk and were often poorly documented   AIG and many other CDS sellers were thus highly exposed to systemic credit con  tagion a situation in which defaults in one area of an economy ripple into another  accompanied by bank weaknesses and failures  rapidly falling equity markets  rising  credit risk premiums  and a general loss of confidence in the financial system and the  economy  These presumably well  diversified risks guaranteed by CDS sellers  operating  as though they were insurance companies  ultimately proved to be poorly diversified   Systemic financial risks can spread more rapidly than fire health and casualty risks    Virtually no other risks  except those originating from wars or epidemics  spread in  the manner of systemic financial risks   Thus  to understand and appreciate the importance of the CDS market it is neces   sary to recognize how that market can fail  The ability to separate and trade risks is a  valuable one  Banks can continue to make loans to their customers  thereby satisfying

6,40,  An option provides which of the following  A Either the right to buy or the right to sell an underlying B The right to buy and sell with the choice made at expiration C The obligation to buy or sell which can be converted into the right to  buy or sell   Which of the following is not a characteristic of a call option on a stock  A A guarantee that the stock will increase B A specified date on which the right to buy expires C A fixed price at which the call holder can buy the stock   A credit derivative is which of the following  A A derivative in which the premium is obtained on credit B A derivative in which the payoff is borrowed by the seller C A derivative in which the seller provides protection to the buyer  against credit loss from a third party
7,40,Solution to   
8,40,A is correct   An option is strictly the right to buy  a call  or the right to sell  a  put   It does not provide both choices or the right to convert an obligation into  a right  
9,40,Solution to   
10,40,A is correct   A call option on a stock provides no guarantee of any change in the  stock price  It has an expiration date and it provides for a fixed price at which  the holder can exercise the option thereby purchasing the stock  
11,40,Solution to   
12,40,C is correct   Credit derivatives provide a guarantee against loss caused by a  third party  s default   They do not involve borrowing the premium or the payoff 
13,40,      Asset  Backed Securities
14,40,Although these instruments are covered in more detail in the fixed  income material  we would be remiss if we failed to include them with derivatives   But we will give  them only light coverage here

2,41,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,41,As discussed earlier derivatives take  derive  their value from the value of the  underlying  as do mutual funds and exchange  traded funds  ETFs   A mutual fund or  an ETF holding bonds is virtually identical to the investor holding the bonds directly   Asset  backed securities  ABSs  take this concept a step further by altering the payment  streams   ABSs typically divide the payments into slices  called tranches  in which the  priority of claims has been changed from equivalent to preferential  For example in  a bond mutual fund or an ETF all investors in the fund have equal claims  and so the  rate of return earned by each investor is exactly the same  If a portfolio of the same  bonds were assembled into an ABS some investors in the ABS would have claims  that would supersede those of other investors   The differential nature of these claims  becomes relevant when either prepayments or defaults occur  Prepayments mostly affect only mortgages   When a portfolio of mortgages is  assembled into an ABS the resulting instrument is called a collateralized mortgage  obligation  CMO   Commonly but not always  the credit risk has been reduced or  eliminated perhaps by a CDS as discussed earlier  When homeowners pay off their  mortgages early due to refinancing at lower rates  the holders of the mortgages suf  fer losses   They expected to receive a stream of returns that is now terminated  The  funds that were previously earning a particular rate will now have to be invested to  earn a lower rate  These losses are the mirror images of the gains homeowners make  when they proudly proclaim that they refinanced their mortgages and substantially  lowered their payments   CMOs partition the claims against these mortgages into different tranches  which  are typically called A  B and C   Class C tranches bear the first wave of prepayments  until that tranche has been completely repaid its full principal investment   At that  point the Class B tranche holders bear the next prepayments until they have been fully  repaid  The Class A tranche holders then bear the next wave of prepayments     Thus   the risk faced by the various tranche holders is different from that of a mutual fund  or ETF which would pass the returns directly through such that investors would all  receive the same rates of return  Therefore the expected returns of CMO tranches vary  and are commensurate with the prepayment risk they assume  Some CMOs are also  characterized by credit risk  perhaps a substantial amount from subprime mortgages   When bonds or loans are assembled into ABSs  they are typically called collater 
4,41,alized bond obligations  CBOs  or collateralized loan obligations  CLOs   These
5,41,instruments  known collectively as collateralized debt obligations or CDOs  do not  traditionally have much prepayment risk but they do have credit risk and oftentimes  a great deal of it   The CDO structure allocates this risk to tranches that are called  senior mezzanine or junior tranches  the last sometimes called equity tranches    When defaults occur the junior tranches bear the risk first followed by the mezzanine  tranches  and then the senior tranches   The expected returns of the tranches vary  according to the perceived credit risk  with the senior tranches having the highest  credit quality and the junior the lowest   Thus  the senior tranches have the lowest  expected returns and the junior tranches have the highest   An asset  backed security is formally defined as follows   An asset  backed security is a derivative contract in which a portfolio of debt  instruments is assembled and claims are issued on the portfolio in the form  of tranches which have different priorities of claims on the payments made  by the debt securities such that prepayments or credit losses are allocated to  the most  junior tranches first and the most  senior tranches last  
6,41,   The reference to only three tranches is just a general statement   There are many more types of tranches    Our discussion of the three classes is for illustrative purposes only and serves to emphasize that there are  high  priority claims  low  priority claims  and other claims somewhere in the middle 
1,42,Types of Derivatives
2,42,  
3,42,ABSs seem to have only an indirect and subtle resemblance to options  but they are  indeed options   They promise to make a series of returns that are typically steady  These  returns can be lowered if prepayments or defaults occur  Thus  they are contingent  on prepayments and defaults   Take a look again at Exhibit   Panel B  the profit and  payoff of a short put option   If all goes well there is a fixed return  If something goes  badly the return can be lowered and the worse the outcome the lower the return   Thus  holders of ABSs have effectively written put options   This completes the discussion of contingent claims   Having now covered forward  commitments and contingent claims  the final category of derivative instruments is  more or less just a catch  all category in case something was missed 
4,42,    Hybrids
5,42,The instruments just covered encompass all the fundamental instruments that exist in  the derivatives world  Yet  the derivatives world is truly much larger than implied by  what has been covered here  We have not covered and will touch only lightly on the  many hybrid instruments that combine derivatives  fixed  income securities  curren  cies  equities  and commodities   For example options can be combined with bonds to  form either callable bonds or convertible bonds   Swaps can be combined with options  to form swap payments that have upper and lower limits   Options can be combined  with futures to obtain options on futures   Options can be created with swaps as the  underlying to form swaptions   Some of these instruments will be covered later  For  now you should just recognize that the possibilities are almost endless   We will not address these hybrids directly but some are covered elsewhere in the  curriculum  The purpose of discussing them here is for you to realize that derivatives  create possibilities not otherwise available in their absence  This point will lead to a  better understanding of why derivatives exist  a topic we will get to very shortly 
6,42,EXAMPLE  
7,42,Forward Commitments versus Contingent Claims
8,42,  Which of the following is not a forward commitment  A An agreement to take out a loan at a future date at a specific rate B An offer of employment that must be accepted or rejected in two  weeks C An agreement to lease a piece of machinery for one year with a series  of fixed monthly payments   Which of the following statements is true about contingent claims  A Either party can default to the other  B The payoffs are linearly related to the performance of the underlying   C The most the long can lose is the amount paid for the contingent  claim 
9,42,Solution to   
10,42,B is correct   Both A and C are commitments to engage in transactions at future  dates   In fact  C is like a swap because the party agrees to make a series of future  payments and in return receives temporary use of an asset whose value could  vary  B is a contingent claim  The party receiving the employment offer can  accept it or reject it if there is a better alternative 
1,43,  
2,43,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,43,Solution to   
4,43,C is correct   The maximum loss to the long is the premium  The payoffs of  contingent claims are not linearly related to the underlying  and only one party  the short  can default  
5,43,    Derivatives Underlyings
6,43,Before discussing the purposes and benefits of derivatives  we need to clarify some  points that have been implied so far  We have alluded to certain underlying assets   this section will briefly discuss the underlyings more directly 
7,43,      Equities
8,43,Equities are one of the most popular categories of underlyings on which derivatives are  created  There are two types of equities on which derivatives exist   individual stocks  and stock indexes   Derivatives on individual stocks are primarily options   Forwards   futures  and swaps on individual stocks are not widely used  Index derivatives in the  form of options  forwards  futures  and swaps are very popular  Index swaps  more  often called equity swaps  are quite popular and permit investors to pay the return on  one stock index and receive the return on another index or a fixed rate  They can be  very useful in asset allocation strategies by allowing an equity manager to increase or  reduce exposure to an equity market or sector without trading the individual securities   In addition options on stocks are frequently used by companies as compensation  and incentives for their executives and employees   These options are granted to pro  vide incentives to work toward driving the stock price up and can result in companies  paying lower cash compensation    Some companies also issue warrants  which are  options sold to the public that allow the holders to exercise them and buy shares  directly from the companies    
9,43,      Fixed  Income Instruments and Interest Rates
10,43,Options  forwards  futures  and swaps on bonds are widely used  The problem with  creating derivatives on bonds  however is that there are almost always many issues  of bonds   A single issuer whether it is a government or a private borrower often has  more than one bond issue outstanding   For futures contracts  with their standardiza  tion requirements  this problem is particularly challenging   What does it mean to say  that a futures contract is on a German bund a US Treasury note or a UK gilt  The  most common solution to this problem is to allow multiple issues to be delivered on  a single futures contract   This feature adds some interesting twists to the pricing and  trading strategies of these instruments   Until now we have referred to the underlying as an asset  Yet  one of the largest  derivative underlyings is not an asset   It is simply an interest rate  An interest rate is  not an asset  One cannot hold an interest rate or place it on a balance sheet as an asset   Although one can hold an instrument that pays an interest rate the rate itself is not
11,43,   Unfortunately the industry has created some confusion with the terminology of these instruments   They  are often referred to as stock options and yet ordinary publicly traded options not granted to employees  are sometimes referred to as stock options   The latter are also sometimes called equity options whereas  employee  granted options are almost never referred to as equity options   If the terms executive stock  options and employee stock options were always used there would be no problem  You should be aware of  and careful about this confusion     A warrant is a type of option similar to the employee stock option written by the company on its own  stock  in contrast to exchange  traded and OTC options  in which the company is not a party to the option  contract   Also note that  unfortunately the financial world uses the term warrant to refer to a number of  other option  like instruments   Like a lot of words that have multiple meanings  one must understand the  context to avoid confusion 
1,44,Types of Derivatives
2,44,  
3,44,an asset   But there are derivatives in which the rate not the instrument that pays the  rate is the underlying   In fact  we have already covered one of these derivatives   The  plain vanilla interest rate swap in which Libor is the underlying     Instead of a swap  an interest rate derivative could be an option  For example a call option on     day  Libor with a strike of    would pay off if at expiration Libor exceeds     If Libor is  below    the option simply expires unexercised  Interest rate derivatives are the most widely used derivatives   With that in mind  we will be careful in using the expression underlying asset and will use the more  generic underlying 
4,44,      Currencies
5,44,Currency risk is a major factor in global financial markets  and the currency deriv  atives market is extremely large  Options  forwards  futures  and swaps are widely  used  Currency derivatives can be complex  sometimes combining elements of other  underlyings   For example a currency swap involves two parties making a series of  interest rate payments to each other in different currencies   Because interest rates  and currencies are both subject to change a currency swap has two sources of risk    Although this instrument may sound extremely complicated it merely reflects the  fact that companies operating across borders are subject to both interest rate risk and  currency risk and currency swaps are commonly used to manage those risks  
6,44,      Commodities
7,44,Commodities are resources  such as food oil and metals  that humans use to sustain  life and support economic activity  Because of the economic principle of comparative  advantage countries often specialize in the production of certain resources   Thus  the  commodities market is extremely large and subject to an almost unimaginable array  of risks   One need only observe how the price of oil moves up as tension builds in  the Middle East or how the price of orange juice rises on a forecast of cold weather  in Florida   Commodity derivatives are widely used to speculate in and manage the risk asso  ciated with commodity price movements   The primary commodity derivatives are  futures  but forwards  swaps  and options are also used  The reason that futures are  in the lead in the world of commodities is simply history  The first futures markets  were futures on commodities   The first futures exchange the Chicago Board of Trade  was created in      and until the creation of currency futures in      there were no  futures on any underlying except commodities   There has been a tendency to think of the commodities world as somewhat sep  arate from the financial world  Commodity traders and financial traders were quite  different groups   Since the creation of financial futures  however commodity and  financial traders have become relatively homogeneous   Moreover commodities are  increasingly viewed as an important asset class that should be included in investment  strategies because of their ability to help diversify portfolios  
8,44,      Credit
9,44,As we previously discussed credit is another underlying and quite obviously not an  asset   Credit default swaps  CDSs  and collateralized debt obligations  CDOs  were  discussed extensively in an earlier section  These instruments have clearly established  that credit is a distinct underlying that has widespread interest from a trading and risk  management perspective  In addition to the credit of a single entity credit derivatives
10,44,   As you will see later there are also futures in which the underlying is an interest rate  Eurodollar futures   and forwards in which the underlying is an interest rate  forward rate agreements  or FRAs  
1,45,  
2,45,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,45,are created on multiple entities   CDOs themselves are credit derivatives on portfolios  of credit risks   In recent years  indexes of CDOs have been created and instruments  based on the payoffs of these CDO indexes are widely traded 
4,45,      Other
5,45,This category is included here to capture some of the really unusual underlyings   One  in particular is weather  Although weather is hardly an asset  it is certainly a major  force in how some entities perform  For example a ski resort needs snow farmers  need an adequate but not excessive amount of rain and public utilities experience  strains on their capacity during temperature extremes   Derivatives exist in which the  payoffs are measured as snowfall rainfall and temperature  Although these deriva  tives have not been widely used because of some complexities in pricing  among  other things they continue to exist and may still have a future  In addition there are  derivatives on electricity which is also not an asset  It cannot be held in the traditional  sense because it is created and consumed almost instantaneously  Another unusual  type of derivative is based on disasters in the form of insurance claims   Financial institutions will continue to create derivatives on all types of risks and  exposures   Most of these derivatives will fail because of little trading interest  but a  few will succeed  If that speaks badly of derivatives  it must be remembered that most  small businesses fail most creative ideas fail and most people who try to become  professional entertainers or athletes fail  It is the sign of a healthy and competitive  system that only the very best survive 
6,45,THE S IZE OF THE DER IVATIVES MARKET
7,45,In case anyone thinks that the derivatives market is not large enough to justify studying  we should consider how big the market is  Unfor tunately gauging the size of the deriv  atives market is not a simple task   OTC derivatives contracts are private transactions  No  repor ting agency gathers data and market size is not measured in traditional volume    based metrics such as shares traded in the stock market  Complicating things fur ther is  the fact that derivatives underlyings include equities fixed  income securities interest  rates currencies commodities and a variety of other underlyings  All these underlyings  have their own units of measurement  Hence measuring how  big  the underlying  derivatives markets are is like trying to measure how much fruit consumers purchase   the proverbial mixing of apples oranges bananas and all other fruits  The exchange   listed derivatives market repor ts its size in terms of volume meaning  the number of contracts traded  Exchange   listed volume however is an inconsistent  number  For example US Treasury bond futures contracts trade in units covering          face value  Eurodollar futures contracts trade in units covering          face value   Crude oil trades in        barrel     gallons each  units  Yet one traded contract of each  gets equal weighting in volume totals  The March April issue of the magazine Futures Industry  available to subscribers   repor ts the annual volume of the entire global futures and options industry  For       that volume was more than    billion contracts  OTC volume is even more difficult to measure  There is no count of the number of  contracts that trade  In fact volume is an almost meaningless concept in OTC markets  because any notion of volume requires a standardized size  If a customer goes to a swaps  dealer and enters into a swap to hedge a     million loan there is no measure of how  much volume that transaction generated  The      million swap s notional principal  however does provide a measure to some ex tent  Forwards swaps and OTC options all  have notional principals so they can be measured in that manner  Another measure of  the size of the derivatives market is the market value of these contracts  As noted for  wards and swaps star t with zero market value but their market value changes as market  conditions change  Options do not star t with zero market value and almost always have  a positive market value until expiration when some options expire out of the money 
1,46,The Purposes and Benefits of Derivatives
2,46,  
3,46,The OTC industry has taken both of these concepts notional principal and market  value as measures of the size of the market  Notional principal is probably a more  accurate measure  The amount of a contract  s notional principal is unambiguous  It is  written into the contract and the two par ties cannot disagree over it  Yet notional prin  cipal terribly overstates the amount of money actually at risk   For example a     million  notional principal swap will have nowhere near     million at risk   The payments on such  a swap are merely the net of two opposite series of interest payments on     million   The market value of such a swap is the present value of one stream of payments minus  the present value of the other  This market value figure will always be well below the  notional principal  Thus market value seems like a better measure except that unlike  notional principal it is not unambiguous  Market value requires measurement and two  par ties can disagree on the market value of the same transaction  Notional principal and market value estimates for the global OTC derivatives market are  collected semi  annually by the Bank for International Settlements of Basel Switzerland  and published on its website  http   www bis org statistics derstats htm   At the end  of      notional principal was more than       trillion and market value was about       trillion  A figure of       trillion is an almost unfathomable number and as noted  is a misleading measure of the amount of money at risk     The market value figure of      trillion is a much more realistic measure but as noted it is less accurate relying on  estimates provided by banks  Hence the exchange   listed and OTC markets use different measures and each of those  measures is subject to severe limitations  About all we can truly say for sure about the  derivatives market is  It is big  
4,46, 
5,46,THE PURPOSES AND BENEFITS OF DERIVATIVES
6,46,Economic historians know that derivatives markets have existed since at least the  Middle Ages   It is unclear whether derivatives originated in the Asian rice markets  or possibly in medieval trade fairs in Europe  We do know that the origin of modern  futures markets is the creation of the Chicago Board of Trade in       To understand  why derivatives markets exist it is useful to take a brief look at why the Chicago Board  of Trade was formed  In the middle of the   th century midwestern America was rapidly becoming the  center of agricultural production in the United States   At the same time Chicago was  evolving into a major American city a hub of transportation and commerce  Grain  markets in Chicago were the central location to which midwestern farmers brought  their wheat  corn and soybeans to sell  Unfortunately most of these products arrived  at approximately the same time of the year September through November  The stor  age facilities in Chicago were strained beyond capacity  As a result  prices would fall  tremendously and some farmers reportedly found it more economical to dump their  grains in the Chicago River rather than transport them back to the farm  At other  times of the year prices would rise steeply  A group of businessmen saw this situation  as unnecessary volatility and a waste of valuable produce  To deal with this problem  they created the Chicago Board of Trade and a financial instrument called the  to   arrive  contract   A farmer could sell a to  arrive contract at any time during the year   This contract fixed the price of the farmer  s grain on the basis of delivery in Chicago  at a specified later date  Grain is highly storable so farmers can hold on to the grain  and deliver it at almost any later time  This plan substantially reduced seasonal market  volatility and made the markets work much better for all parties  
7,46,   To put it in perspective it would take    million years for a clock to tick off     trillion seconds 
1,47,  
2,47,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,47,The traders in Chicago began to trade these contracts  speculating on movements  in grain prices   Soon it became apparent that an important and fascinating market  had developed  Widespread hedging and speculative interest resulted in substantial  market growth and about    years later a clearinghouse and a performance guaran  tee were added thus completing the evolution of the to  arrive contract into today  s  modern futures contract   Many commodities and all financial assets that underlie derivatives contracts are  not seasonally produced  Hence this initial motivation for futures markets is only  a minor advantage of derivatives markets today  But there are many reasons why  derivative markets serve an important and useful purpose in contemporary finance 
4,47,    Risk Allocation Transfer and Management
5,47,Until the advent of derivatives markets  risk management was quite cumbersome   Setting the actual level of risk to the desired level of risk required engaging in trans  actions in the underlyings   Such transactions typically had high transaction costs and  were disruptive of portfolios   In many cases  it is quite difficult to fine  tune the level  of risk to the desired level  From the perspective of a risk taker it was quite costly to  buy risk because a large amount of capital would be required  Derivatives solve these problems in a very effective way   They allow trading the  risk without trading the instrument itself  For example consider a stockholder who  wants to reduce exposure to a stock   In the pre  derivatives era  the only way to do so  was to sell the stock   Now the stockholder can sell futures  forwards  calls  or swaps   or buy put options  all while retaining the stock   For a company founder these types  of strategies can be particularly useful because the founder can retain ownership and  probably board membership  Many other excellent examples of the use of derivatives  to transfer risk are covered elsewhere in the curriculum  The objective at this point  is to establish that derivatives provide an effective method of transferring risk from  parties who do not want the risk to parties who do  In this sense risk allocation is  improved within markets and indeed the entire global economy  The overall purpose of derivatives is to obtain more effective risk management  within companies and the entire economy  Although some argue that derivatives do  not serve this purpose very well  we will discuss this point in Section    for now you  should understand that derivatives can improve the allocation of risk and facilitate  more effective risk management for both companies and economies  
6,47,    Information Discovery
7,47,One of the advantages of futures markets has been described as price discovery  A  futures price has been characterized by some experts as a revelation of some infor  mation about the future  Thus  a futures price is sometimes thought of as predictive   This statement is not strictly correct because futures prices are not really forecasts  of future spot prices   They provide only a little more information than do spot  prices  but they do so in a very efficient manner  The markets for some underlyings  are highly decentralized and not very efficient   For example what is gold worth  It  trades in markets around the world but probably the best place to look is at the gold  futures contract expiring soonest   What is the value of the S P     Index when the  US markets are not open  As it turns out  US futures markets open before the US  stock market opens   The S P     futures price is frequently viewed as an indication  of where the stock market will open 
1,48,The Purposes and Benefits of Derivatives
2,48,  
3,48,Derivative markets can however convey information not impounded in spot  markets   By virtue of the fact that derivative markets require less capital information  can flow into the derivative markets before it gets into the spot market   The difference  may well be only a matter of minutes or possibly seconds  but it can provide the edge  to astute traders   Finally we should note that futures markets convey another simple piece of infor  mation  What price would one accept to avoid uncertainty  If you hold a stock worth      and could hedge the next    months  uncertainty what locked  in price should  you expect to earn  As it turns out  it should be the price that guarantees the risk  free  rate minus whatever dividends would be paid on the stock   Derivatives specifically  futures  forwards  and swaps reveal the price that the holder of an asset could take  and avoid the risk   What we have said until now applies to futures  forwards  and swaps   What about  options  As you will learn later given the underlying and the type of option  call or  put  an option price reflects two characteristics of the option  exercise price and time  to expiration  three characteristics of the underlying  price volatility and cash flows it  might pay  and one general macroeconomic factor  risk  free rate   Only one of these  factors  volatility is not relatively easy to identify  But with the available models to price  the option we can infer what volatility people are using from the actual market prices  at which they execute trades   That volatility called implied volatility measures the  expected risk of the underlying   It reflects the volatility that investors use to determine  the market price of the option  Knowing the expected risk of the underlying asset is  an extremely useful piece of information  In fact  for options on broad  based market  indexes  such as the S P     the implied volatility is a good measure of the general  level of uncertainty in the market   Some experts have even called it a measure of fear   Thus  options provide information about what investors think of the uncertainty in  the market  if not their fear of it     In addition options allow the creation of trading strategies that cannot be done  by using the underlying   As the exhibits on options explained these strategies provide  asymmetrical performance  limited movement in one direction and movement in the  other direction that changes with movements in the underlying  
4,48,    Operational Advantages
5,48,We noted earlier that derivatives have lower transaction costs than the underlying   The  transaction costs of derivatives can be high relative to the value of the derivatives  but  these costs are typically low relative to the value of the underlying   Thus  an investor  who wants to take a position in say an equity market index would likely find it less  costly to use the futures to get a given degree of exposure than to invest directly in  the index to get that same exposure  Derivative markets also typically have greater liquidity than the underlying spot  markets  a result of the smaller amount of capital required to trade derivatives than to  get the equivalent exposure directly in the underlying   Futures margin requirements  and option premiums are quite low relative to the cost of the underlying   One other extremely valuable operational advantage of derivative markets is the  ease with which one can go short   With derivatives  it is nearly as easy to take a short  position as to take a long position whereas for the underlying asset it is almost always  much more difficult to go short than to go long   In fact  for many commodities  short  selling is nearly impossible 
6,48,   The Chicago Board Options Exchange publishes a measure of the implied volatility of the S P     Index  option which is called the VIX  volatility index   The VIX is widely followed and is cited as a measure of  investor uncertainty and sometimes fear

3,49,    Market Efficiency
4,49,In the study of portfolio management  you learn that an efficient market is one in  which no single investor can consistently earn returns in the long run in excess of  those commensurate with the risk assumed  Of course endless debates occur over  whether equity markets are efficient   No need to resurrect that issue here but let us  proceed with the assumption that equity markets and in fact  most free and com  petitive financial markets are reasonably efficient   This assumption does not mean  that abnormal returns can never be earned and indeed prices do get out of line with  fundamental values   But competition the relatively free flow of information and ease  of trading tend to bring prices back in line with fundamental values   Derivatives can  make this process work even more rapidly  When prices deviate from fundamental values  derivative markets offer less costly  ways to exploit the mispricing   As noted earlier less capital is required transaction  costs are lower and short selling is easier  We also noted that as a result of these  features  it is possible indeed likely that fundamental value will be reflected in the  derivatives markets before it is restored in the underlying market   Although this time  difference could be only a matter of minutes  for a trader seeking abnormal returns   a few minutes can be a valuable opportunity  All these advantages of derivatives markets make the financial markets in general  function more effectively  Investors are far more willing to trade if they can more  easily manage their risk  trade at lower cost and with less capital and go short more  easily  This increased willingness to trade increases the number of market participants   which makes the market more liquid  A very liquid market may not automatically be  an efficient market  but it certainly has a better chance of being one  Even if one does not accept the concept that financial markets are efficient  it is  difficult to say that markets are not more effective and competitive with derivatives    Yet  many blame derivatives for problems in the market   Let us take a look at these  arguments  
5,49,CRITICISMS AND MISUSES OF DERIVATIVES
6,49,The history of financial markets is filled with extreme ups and downs  which are often  called bubbles and crashes   Bubbles occur when prices rise for a long time and appear  to exceed fundamental values   Crashes occur when prices fall rapidly  Although bubbles   if they truly exist  are troublesome crashes are even more so because nearly everyone  loses substantial wealth in a crash  A crash is then typically followed by a government  study commissioned to find the causes of the crash  In the last    years  almost all  such studies have implicated derivatives as having some role in causing the crash  Of  course because derivatives are widely used and involve a high degree of leverage it is  a given that they would be seen in a crash  It is unclear whether derivatives are the real  culprit or just the proverbial smoking gun used by someone to do something wrong   The two principal arguments against derivatives are that they are such speculative  devices that they effectively permit legalized gambling and that they destabilize the  financial system  Let us look at these points more closely 
7,49,    Speculation and Gambling
8,49,As noted earlier derivatives are frequently used to manage risk   In many contexts  this  use involves hedging or laying off risk   Naturally for hedging to work  there must be  speculators   Someone must accept the risk   Derivatives markets are unquestionably  attractive to speculators   All the benefits of derivatives draw speculators in large

4,50,    Destabilization and Systemic Risk
5,50,The arguments against speculation through derivatives often go a step further claiming  that it is not merely speculation or gambling per se but rather that it has destabilizing  consequences   Opponents of derivatives claim that the very benefits of derivatives   low cost  low capital requirements  ease of going short  result in an excessive amount  of speculative trading that brings instability to the market   They argue that specula  tors use large amounts of leverage thereby subjecting themselves and their creditors  to substantial risk if markets do not move in their hoped  for direction  Defaults by  speculators can then lead to defaults by their creditors  their creditors  creditors  and  so on  These effects can therefore be systemic and reflect an epidemic contagion  whereby instability can spread throughout markets and an economy if not the entire  world  Given that governments often end up bailing out some banks and insurance  companies  society has expressed concern that the risk managed with derivatives  must be controlled  This argument is not without merit   Such effects occurred in the Long  Term  Capital Management fiasco of      and again in the financial crisis of      in which  derivatives  particularly credit default swaps  were widely used by many of the problem

3,51,entities   Responses to such events typically take the course of calling for more rules  and regulations restricting the use of derivatives  requiring more collateral and credit  mitigation measures  backing up banks with more capital and encouraging  if not  requiring  OTC derivatives to be centrally cleared like exchange  traded derivatives   In response however we should note that financial crises including the South  Sea and Mississippi bubbles and the stock market crash of      as well as a handful  of economic calamities of the   th and   th centuries have existed since the dawn  of capitalism  Some of these events preceded the era of modern derivatives markets   and others were completely unrelated to the use of derivatives   Some organizations   such as Orange County California  in           have proved that derivatives are not  required to take on excessive leverage and nearly bring the entity to ruin  Proponents  of derivatives argue that derivatives are but one of many mechanisms through which  excessive risk can be taken  Derivatives may seem dangerous  and they can be if  misused but there are many ways to take on leverage that look far less harmful but  can be just as risky  Another criticism of derivatives is simply their complexity  Many derivatives  are extremely complex and require a high  level understanding of mathematics   The  financial industry employs many mathematicians  physicists  and computer scien  tists   This single fact has made many distrust derivatives and the people who work  on them  It is unclear why this reason has tarnished the reputation of the derivatives  industry  Scientists work on complex problems in medicine and engineering without  public distrust   One explanation probably lies in the fact that scientists create models  of markets by using scientific principles that often fail  To a physicist modeling the  movements of celestial bodies  the science is reliable and the physicist is unlikely to  misapply the science  The same science applied to financial markets is far less reliable   Financial markets are driven by the actions of people who are not as consistent as the  movements of celestial bodies   When financial models fail to work as they should  the scientists are often blamed for either building models that are too complex and  unable to accurately capture financial reality or misusing those models  such as using  poor estimates of inputs   And derivatives  being so widely used and heavily leveraged  are frequently in the center of it all

2,52,  
3,52,B Derivatives are sufficiently regulated that they cannot destabilize the  spot market   C The transaction costs of derivatives are high enough to keep their use  at a minimum level 
4,52,Solution to   
5,52,A is correct   Derivative markets are not by nature more or less volatile than  spot markets   They facilitate risk allocation by making it easier and less costly  to transfer risk  and their transaction costs are lower than those of spot markets  
6,52,Solution to   
7,52,B is correct   Options do convey the volatility of the underlying  and futures   forwards  and swaps convey the price at which uncertainty in the underlying  can be eliminated  Derivatives do not convey any information about the use of  the underlying in strategies  
8,52,Solution to   
9,52,A is correct   Derivatives regulation is not more and is arguably less than spot  market regulation and the transaction costs of derivatives are not a deterrent  to their use  in fact  derivatives are widely used  Market crashes and panics have  a very long history much longer than that of derivatives  
10,52,An important element of understanding and using derivatives is having a healthy  respect for their power  Every day we use chemicals  electricity and fire without  thinking about their dangers   We consume water and drive automobiles  both of which  are statistically quite dangerous   Perhaps these risks are underappreciated but it is  more likely the case that most adults learn how to safely use chemicals  electricity  fire water and automobiles   Of course there are exceptions  many of which are fool  ish and foolishness is no stranger to the derivatives industry  The lesson here is that  derivatives can make our financial lives better but like chemicals  electricity and all  the rest  we need to know how to use them safely which is why they are an important  part of the CFA curriculum  Later in the curriculum you will learn a great deal about how derivatives are  priced  At this point  we introduce the pricing of derivatives   This material not only  paves the way for a deeper understanding of derivatives but also complements earlier  material by helping you understand how derivatives work  
11,52,ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF DERIVATIVE PRICING
12,52,Pricing and valuation are fundamental elements of the CFA Program  The study of  fixed  income and equity securities  as well as their application in portfolio manage  ment  is solidly grounded on the principle of valuation  In valuation the question is  simple  What is something worth  Without an answer to that question one can hardly  proceed to use that something wisely  Determining what a derivative is worth is similar to determining what an asset is  worth  As you learn in the fixed  income and equity readings  value is the present value  of future cash flows  with discounting done at a rate that reflects both the opportunity  cost of money and the risk   Derivatives valuation applies that same principle but in  a somewhat different way 
13,52, 
1,53,  
2,53,Reading      Derivative Markets and Instruments
3,53,Think of a derivative as attached to an underlying   We know that the derivative  derives its value from the value of the underlying   If the underlying  s value changes  so  should the value of the derivative  The underlying takes its value from the discounted  present value of the expected future cash flows it offers  with discounting done at a rate  reflecting the investor  s risk tolerance  But if the value of the underlying is embedded  in the value of the derivative it would be double counting to discount the derivative s  expected future cash flows at a risky discount rate  That effect has already been incor  porated into the value of the underlying  which goes into the value of the derivative  Derivatives usually take their values from the underlying by constructing a hypo  thetical combination of the derivatives and the underlyings that eliminates risk   This  combination is typically called a hedge portfolio  With the risk eliminated it follows  that the hedge portfolio should earn the risk  free rate  A derivative s value is the price  of the derivative that forces the hedge portfolio to earn the risk  free rate  This principle of derivative valuation relies completely on the ability of an investor  to hold or store the underlying asset   Let us take a look at what that means  
4,53,    Storage
5,53,As noted previously the first derivatives were agricultural commodities   Most of  these commodities can be stored  i e  held  for a period of time  Some extreme cases   such as oil and gold which are storable for millions of years  are excellent examples  of fully storable commodities   Grains  such as wheat and corn can be stored for long  but not infinite periods of time  Some commodities  such as bananas  are storable  for relatively short periods of time  In the CFA Program we are more interested in  financial assets   Equities and currencies have perpetual storability whereas bonds are  storable until they mature  Storage incurs costs   Commodity storage costs can be quite expensive  Imagine  storing      kilograms of gold or a million barrels of oil  Financial assets  however  have relatively low storage costs   Some assets pay returns during storage  Stocks pay  dividends and bonds pay interest   The net of payments offered minus storage costs  plays a role in the valuation of derivatives   An example earlier in this reading illustrates this point   Suppose an investor  holds a dividend  paying stock and wants to eliminate the uncertainty of its selling  price over a future period of time  Suppose further that the investor enters into a  forward contract that commits him to deliver the stock at a later date for which he  will receive a fixed price  With uncertainty eliminated the investor should earn the  risk  free rate but in fact  he does not   He earns more because while holding the stock   he collects dividends   Therefore he should earn the risk  free rate minus the dividend  yield a concept known as the cost of carry which will be covered in great detail in  later readings   The cost of carry plus the dividends he earns effectively means that  he makes the risk  free rate  Now no one is claiming that this is a good way to earn  the risk  free rate  There are many better ways to do that  but this strategy could be  executed  There is one and only one forward price that guarantees that this strategy  earns a return of the risk  free rate minus the dividend yield or the risk  free rate after  accounting for the dividends collected  If the forward price at which contracts are  created does not equal this price investors can take advantage of this discrepancy by  engaging in arbitrage which is discussed in the next section  Forwards  futures  swaps  and options are all priced in this manner  Hence they rely  critically on the ability to store or hold the asset   Some underlyings are not storable   We previously mentioned electricity  It is produced and consumed almost instanta  neously  Weather is also not storable  Fresh fish have very limited storability  Although  this absence of storability may not be the reason derivative markets in these types of  underlyings have not been particularly successful whereas those in underlyings that  are more easily storable have often been successful 
1,54,Elementary Principles of Derivative Pricing
2,54,  
3,54,The opposite of storability is the ability to go short that is  to borrow the underly  ing  sell it  and buy it back later  We discussed earlier that short selling of some assets  can be difficult   It is not easy to borrow oil or soybeans   There are ways around this  constraint but derivatives valuation is generally much easier when the underlying can  be shorted  This point is discussed in more depth later in the curriculum 
4,54,    Arbitrage
5,54,What we have been describing is the foundation of the principle of arbitrage  In  well  functioning markets with low transaction costs and a free flow of information  the same asset cannot sell for more than one price  If it did someone would buy it in  the cheaper market and sell it in the more expensive market  earning a riskless profit    The combined actions of all parties doing this would push up the lower price and  push down the higher price until they converged  For this reason arbitrage is often  referred to as the law of one price  Of course for arbitrage to be feasible the ability  to purchase and sell short the asset is important   Obviously this rule does not apply to all markets   The same consumer good  can easily sell for different prices  which is one reason why people spend so much  time shopping on the internet   The costs associated with purchasing the good in the  cheaper market and selling it in the more expensive market can make the arbitrage  not worthwhile  The absence of information on the very fact that different prices exist  would also prevent the arbitrage from occurring   Although the internet and various  price  comparing websites reduce these frictions and encourage all sellers to offer  competitive prices  consumer goods are never likely to be arbitragable    Financial markets  of course are a different matter  Information on securities prices  around the world is quite accessible and relatively inexpensive  Most financial markets  are fairly competitive because dealers  speculators  and brokers attempt to execute  trades at the best prices   Arbitrage is considered a dependable rule in the financial  markets   Nonetheless  there are people who purport to make a living as arbitrageurs    How could they exist  To figure that out  first consider some examples of arbitrage  The simplest case of an arbitrage might be for the same stock to sell at different  prices in two markets   If the stock were selling at     in one market and     in  another an arbitrageur would buy the stock at     in the one market and sell it at      in the other  This trade would net an immediate    profit at no risk and would  not require the commitment of any of the investor  s capital  This outcome would be  a strong motivation for all arbitrageurs  and their combined actions would force the  lower price up and the higher price down until the prices converged  But what would be the final price  It is entirely possible that     is the true fun  damental value and     is too high  Or     could be the true fundamental value and      is too low  Or the true fundamental value could lie somewhere between the two   Arbitrage does not tell us the true fundamental value  It is not an absolute valuation  methodology such as the discounted cash flow equity valuation model  It is a relative  valuation methodology  It tells us the correct price of one asset or derivative relative  to another asset or derivative  Now consider another situation illustrated in Exhibit    Observe that we have one  stock  AXE Electronics  that today is worth     and one period later will be worth  either     or      We will denote these prices as AXE       AXE        and AXE          Another stock  BYF Technology is today worth     and one period later will
6,54,   If the same consumer good sells for different prices in markets with a relatively free flow of information   e g   via price  comparing websites  it still may not be possible to truly arbitrage  Buying the good at a lower  price and selling it at a higher price but less than the price of the most expensive seller may not be practical  but the most expensive seller may be driven out of business   When everyone knows what everyone else is  charging  the same effect of arbitrage can still occur

3,56,If the top outcome in Exhibit    occurs  we sell the     shares of BYF for                       This amount is sufficient to buy back the     shares of AXE  which  is selling for      But we will also have the bonds  which are worth                        If the bottom outcome occurs  we sell the     shares of BYF for                      enough money to buy back the     shares of AXE  which is selling for       Again we will have the risk  free bonds  worth       Regardless of the outcome we  end up with       Recall that we invested no money of our own and end up with a sure       It  should be apparent that this transaction is extremely attractive so everyone would  do it   The combined actions of multiple investors would drive down the price of AXE  and or drive up the price of BYF until an equilibrium is reached at which point this  transaction would no longer be profitable  As noted earlier we cannot be sure of  the correct fundamental price but let us assume that BYF s price remains constant    Then AXE would fall to         Alternatively if we assume that AXE s price remains  constant  then the price of BYF would rise to      These values are obtained by noting  that the prices for both outcomes occur according to the ratio                                         Thus  their initial prices should be consistent with that ratio  If BYF is      AXE should be                      If AXE is     BYF should be        because                         Of course the two prices could settle in between  Arbitrage is  only a relative pricing method  It prices the two stocks in relation to each other but  does not price either on the basis of its own fundamentals   Of course this example is extremely simplified  Clearly a stock price can change  to more than two other prices   Also if a given stock is at one price another stock  may be at any other price  We have created a simple case here to illustrate a point    But as you will learn later in the curriculum when derivatives are involved the sim  plification here is relatively safe  As we know the price of a derivative is determined  by the price of the underlying   Hence when the underlying is at one particular price  the derivative s price will be determined by that price  The two assets need not be two  stocks   one can be a stock and the other can be a derivative on the stock   To see that point  consider another type of arbitrage opportunity that involves a  forward contract  Recall from the previous example that at the start AXE sells for       Suppose we borrow     at    interest by issuing a risk  free bond use the money to  buy one share of stock AXE  and simultaneously enter into a forward contract to sell  this share at a price of     one period later  The stock will then move to either     or      in the next period  The forward contract requires that we deliver the stock and  accept     for it   And of course we will owe                  on the loan  Now consider the two outcomes   Regardless of the outcome the end result is the  same  The forward contract fixes the delivery price of the stock at      AXE goes to

3,57,In either case we made    free and clear  In fact  we can even accommodate the  possibility of more than two future prices for AXE and we will always make       The  key point is that we faced no risk and did not have to invest any of our own money  but ended up with    which is clearly a good trade  The    is an arbitrage profit   But  where did it originate  It turns out that the forward price     was an inappropriate price given current  market conditions   In fact  it was just an arbitrary price made up to illustrate the  point   To eliminate the opportunity to earn the    profit  the forward price should  be     which is equal not coincidentally to the amount owed on the loan  It is also  no coincidence that     is the price of the asset increased by the rate of interest   We  will cover this point later in the curriculum but for now consider that you have just  seen your first derivative pricing model    Of course many market participants would do this transaction as long as it gener  ated an arbitrage profit   These forces of arbitrage would either push the forward price  down or the stock price up or both until an equilibrium is reached that eliminates  the opportunity to profit at no risk with no commitment of one s own funds   To summarize the forces of arbitrage in financial markets assure us that the same  asset cannot sell for different prices  nor can two equivalent combinations of assets that  produce the same results sell for different prices   Realistically some arbitrage oppor  tunities can exist on a temporary basis  but they will be quickly exploited bringing  relative prices back in line with each other  Other apparent arbitrage opportunities  will be too small to warrant exploiting   Not to be naive however we must acknowledge that there is a large industry of  people who call themselves arbitrageurs   So how can such an industry exist if there  are no opportunities for riskless profit  One explanation is that most of the arbitrage  transactions are more complex than the simple examples used here  Many involve  estimating information which can result in differing opinions   Arbitrage involving  options  for example usually requires an estimate of a stock s volatility  Different  participants have different opinions about the volatility  It is quite possible that the  two counterparties trading with each other believe that each is arbitraging against  the other    But more importantly the absence of arbitrage opportunities is upheld ironically  only if participants believe that arbitrage opportunities do exist   If traders believe that  no opportunities exist to earn arbitrage profits  then traders will not follow market  prices and compare those prices with what they ought to be  Thus  eliminating arbitrage  opportunities requires that participants be alert in watching for arbitrage opportuni  ties   In other words  strange as it may sound disbelief and skepticism concerning the  absence of arbitrage opportunities are required for the no  arbitrage rule to be upheld  Markets in which arbitrage opportunities are either nonexistent or quickly elimi  nated are relatively efficient markets   Recall that efficient markets are those in which  it is not possible to consistently earn returns in excess of those that would be fair  compensation for the risk assumed  Although abnormal returns can be earned in a  variety of ways  arbitrage profits are definitely examples of abnormal returns   Thus   they are the most egregious violations of the principle of market efficiency 
4,57,   A good study suggestion is to try this example with any future stock price  You should get the same  result  a    risk  free profit      This illustration is the quick look at forward pricing alluded to in Section           In reality many of the transactions that arbitrageurs do are not really arbitrage  They are quite specula  tive  For example many people call themselves arbitrageurs because they buy companies that are potential  takeover targets and sell the companies they think will be the buyers   This transaction is not arbitrage by  any stretch of the definition  Some transactions are called  risk arbitrage  but this term is an oxymoron   As an investment professional you should simply be prepared for such misuses of words  which simply  reflect the flexibility of language 
1,58,Elementary Principles of Derivative Pricing
2,58,  
3,58,Throughout the derivatives component of the CFA curriculum we will use the  principle of arbitrage as a dominant theme and assume that arbitrage opportunities  cannot exist for any significant length of time nor can any one investor consistently  capture them  Thus  prices must conform to models that assume no arbitrage  But we  do not want to take the absence of arbitrage opportunities so seriously that we give  up and believe that arbitrage opportunities never exist   Otherwise they will arise and  someone else will take them  Consider the rule of arbitrage a law that will be broken  from time to time but one that holds far more often than not and one that should be  understood and respected

5,58,Arbitrage
6,58,  Which of the following is a result of arbitrage  A The law of one price B The law of similar prices C The law of limited profitability   When an arbitrage opportunity exists  what happens in the market  A The combined actions of all arbitrageurs force the prices to converge  B The combined actions of arbitrageurs result in a locked  limit situation  C The combined actions of all arbitrageurs result in sustained profits to  all    Which of the following accurately defines arbitrage  A An opportunity to make a profit at no risk B An opportunity to make a profit at no risk and with the investment of  no capital C An opportunity to earn a return in excess of the return appropriate for  the risk assumed   Which of the following ways best describes how arbitrage contributes to  market efficiency  A Arbitrage penalizes those who trade too rapidly  B Arbitrage equalizes the risks taken by all market participants   C Arbitrage improves the rate at which prices converge to their relative  fair values  
7,58,Solution to   
8,58,A is correct   Arbitrage forces equivalent assets to have a single price  There is  nothing called the law of similar prices or the law of limited profitability 
9,58,Solution to   
10,58,A is correct   Prices converge because of the heavy demand for the cheaper asset  and the heavy supply of the more expensive asset   Profits are not sustained and  in fact  they are eradicated as prices converge  Locked  limit is a condition in the  futures market and has nothing to do with arbitrage 
11,58,Solution to   
12,58,B is correct   An opportunity to profit at no risk could merely describe the pur  chase of a risk  free asset   An opportunity to earn a return in excess of the return  appropriate for the risk assumed is a concept studied in portfolio management

3,59,and is often referred to as an abnormal return  It is certainly desirable but is  hardly an arbitrage because it requires the assumption of risk and the invest  ment of capital  Arbitrage is risk free and requires no capital because selling the  overpriced asset produces the funds to buy the underpriced asset  
4,59,Solution to   
5,59,C is correct   Arbitrage imposes no penalties on rapid trading  in fact  it tends  to reward those who trade rapidly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities    Arbitrage has no effect of equalizing risk among market participants   Arbitrage  does result in an acceleration of price convergence to fair values relative to  instruments with equivalent payoffs  
6,59,SUMMARY
7,59,This first reading on derivatives introduces you to the basic characteristics of deriv  atives  including the following points      A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the  performance of an underlying asset      The underlying asset  called the underlying  trades in the cash or spot markets  and its price is called the cash or spot price     Derivatives consist of two general classes   forward commitments and contin  gent claims      Derivatives can be created as standardized instruments on derivatives  exchanges or as customized instruments in the over  the  counter market      Exchange  traded derivatives are standardized highly regulated and transparent  transactions that are guaranteed against default through the clearinghouse of  the derivatives exchange     Over  the  counter derivatives are customized flexible and more private and less  regulated than exchange  traded derivatives  but are subject to a greater risk of  default      A forward contract is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two par  ties agree that one party the buyer will purchase an underlying asset from the  other party the seller at a later date and at a fixed price they agree upon when  the contract is signed     A futures contract is similar to a forward contract but is a standardized deriva  tive contract created and traded on a futures exchange  In the contract  two par  ties agree that one party the buyer will purchase an underlying asset from the  other party the seller at a later date and at a price agreed on by the two parties  when the contract is initiated  In addition there is a daily settling of gains and  losses and a credit guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse     A swap is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two parties agree to  exchange a series of cash flows whereby one party pays a variable series that will  be determined by an underlying asset or rate and the other party pays either  a variable series determined by a different underlying asset or rate or a fixed  series

3,60,   An option is a derivative contract in which one party the buyer pays a sum of  money to the other party the seller or writer and receives the right to either  buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific expiration  date or at any time prior to the expiration date     A call is an option that provides the right to buy the underlying      A put is an option that provides the right to sell the underlying      Credit derivatives are a class of derivative contracts between two parties  the  credit protection buyer and the credit protection seller in which the latter pro  vides protection to the former against a specific credit loss      A credit default swap is the most widely used credit derivative  It is a derivative  contract between two parties  a credit protection buyer and a credit protection  seller in which the buyer makes a series of payments to the seller and receives  a promise of compensation for credit losses resulting from the default of a third  party     An asset  backed security is a derivative contract in which a portfolio of debt  instruments is assembled and claims are issued on the portfolio in the form of  tranches  which have different priorities of claims on the payments made by the  debt securities such that prepayments or credit losses are allocated to the most   junior tranches first and the most  senior tranches last      Derivatives can be combined with other derivatives or underlying assets to form  hybrids      Derivatives are issued on equities  fixed  income securities  interest rates   currencies  commodities  credit  and a variety of such diverse underlyings as  weather electricity and disaster claims      Derivatives facilitate the transfer of risk  enable the creation of strategies and  payoffs not otherwise possible with spot assets  provide information about  the spot market  offer lower transaction costs  reduce the amount of capital  required are easier than the underlyings to go short  and improve the efficiency  of spot markets      Derivatives are sometimes criticized for being a form of legalized gambling and  for leading to destabilizing speculation although these points can generally be  refuted     Derivatives are typically priced by forming a hedge involving the underlying  asset and a derivative such that the combination must pay the risk  free rate and  do so for only one derivative price     Derivatives pricing relies heavily on the principle of storage meaning the ability  to hold or store the underlying asset   Storage can incur costs but can also gen  erate cash such as dividends and interest      Arbitrage is the condition that two equivalent assets or derivatives or combina  tions of assets and derivatives sell for different prices  leading to an opportunity  to buy at the low price and sell at the high price thereby earning a risk  free  profit without committing any capital     The combined actions of arbitrageurs bring about a convergence of prices    Hence arbitrage leads to the law of one price  Transactions that produce equiv  alent results must sell for equivalent prices

4,67,INTRODUCTION
5,67,It is important to understand how prices of derivatives are determined  Whether one  is on the buy side or the sell side a solid understanding of pricing financial products  is critical to effective investment decision making   After all one can hardly determine  what to offer or bid for a financial product  or any product for that matter if one has  no idea how its characteristics combine to create value  Understanding the pricing of financial assets is important   Discounted cash flow  methods and models  such as the capital asset pricing model and its variations  are  useful for determining the prices of financial assets   The unique characteristics of  derivatives  however pose some complexities not associated with assets  such as equi   ties and fixed  income instruments   Somewhat surprisingly however derivatives also  have some simplifying characteristics   For example as we will see in this reading  in  well  functioning derivatives markets the need to determine risk premiums is obviated  by the ability to construct a risk  free hedge  Correspondingly the need to determine  an investor  s risk aversion is irrelevant for derivative pricing  although it is certainly  relevant for pricing the underlying   The purpose of this reading is to establish the foundations of derivative pricing  on a basic conceptual level  The following topics are covered     How does the pricing of the underlying asset affect the pricing of derivatives     How are derivatives priced using the principle of arbitrage     How are the prices and values of forward contracts determined     How are futures contracts priced differently from forward contracts     How are the prices and values of swaps determined     How are the prices and values of European options determined     How does American option pricing differ from European option pricing  This reading is organized as follows   Section   explores two related topics  the  pricing of the underlying assets on which derivatives are created and the principle  of arbitrage  Section   describes the pricing and valuation of forwards  futures  and  swaps   Section   introduces the pricing and valuation of options   Section   provides  a summary

7,67,FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF DERIVATIVE PRICING
8,67,In this section we will briefly review the concepts associated with derivatives  the types  of derivatives  and the pricing principles of the underlying assets   We will also look at  arbitrage a critical concept that links derivative pricing to the price of the underlying  
9,67,    Basic Derivative Concepts
10,67,The definition of a derivative is as follows   A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its performance from the  performance of an underlying asset   A derivative is created as a contract between two parties  the buyer and the seller   Derivatives trade in markets around the world which include organized exchanges   where highly standardized and regulated versions exist and over  the  counter markets 
1,68,Fundamental Concepts of Derivative Pricing
2,68,  
3,68,where customized and more lightly regulated versions trade  The basic characteristics  of derivatives that influence pricing are not particularly related to where the derivatives  trade but are critically dependent on the types of derivatives   The two principal types of derivatives are forward commitments and contingent  claims   A forward commitment is an obligation to engage in a transaction in the  spot market at a future date at terms agreed upon today   By entering into a forward  commitment  a party locks in the terms of a transaction that he or she will conduct  later  The word  commitment  is critical here  A forward contract is a firm obligation  There are three types of forward commitments   forward contracts  futures con  tracts  and swap contracts   These contracts can be referred to more simply as forwards   futures  and swaps   A forward contract is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two  parties agree that one party the buyer will purchase an underlying asset  from the other party the seller at a later date at a fixed price they agree  upon when the contract is signed 
4,68,A futures contract is a standardized derivative contract created and traded  on a futures exchange in which two parties agree that one party the buyer  will purchase an underlying asset from the other party the seller at a later  date at a price agreed upon by the two parties when the contract is initi  ated and in which there is a daily settling of gains and losses and a credit  guarantee by the futures exchange through its clearinghouse  
5,68,A swap contract is an over  the  counter derivative contract in which two  parties agree to exchange a series of cash flows whereby one party pays a  variable series that will be determined by an underlying asset or rate and  the other party pays either    a variable series determined by a different  underlying asset or rate or    a fixed series  As these definitions illustrate forwards and futures are similar  They both establish  the terms of a spot transaction that will occur at a later date  Forwards are custom  ized less transparent  less regulated and subject to higher counterparty default risk    Futures are standardized more transparent  more regulated and generally immune  to counterparty default   A swap is equivalent to a series of forward contracts  a point  that will be illustrated later  A contingent claim is a derivative in which the outcome or payoff is determined  by the outcome or payoff of an underlying asset conditional on some event occurring    Contingent claims include options  credit derivatives  and asset  backed securities    Because credit derivatives and asset  backed securities are highly specialized this  reading will focus only on options   Recall the definition of an option  An option is a derivative contract in which one party the buyer pays a  sum of money to the other party the seller or writer and receives the right  to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price either on a specific  expiration date or at any time prior to the expiration date   Options can be either customized over  the  counter contracts or standardized and  traded on exchanges  
6,68,  Remember that the term  spot market  refers to the market in which the underlying trades   A transaction  in the spot market involves a buyer paying for an asset and receiving it right away or at least within a few  days  given the normal time required to settle a financial transaction

3,69,Because derivatives take their prices from the price of the underlying  it is import  ant to first understand how the underlying is priced  We will approach the underlying  from a slightly different angle one that emphasizes the often  subtle costs of holding  the underlying  which turn out to play a major role in derivative pricing  
4,69,    Pricing the Underlying
5,69,The four main types of underlying on which derivatives are based are equities  fixed   income securities interest rates  currencies  and commodities   Equities  fixed  income  securities  but not interest rates  currencies  and commodities are all assets   An  interest rate is not an asset  but it can be structured as the underlying of a derivative   Consider a generic underlying asset   This asset is something of value that you can  own  Some assets are financial assets  such as equities  bonds  and currencies  and  some are real assets  such as commodities  e g   gold oil and agricultural products   and certain physical objects  e g   houses  automobiles  and computers   The price of a financial asset is often determined using a present value of future  cash flows approach  The value of the financial asset is the expected future price plus  any interim payments such as dividends or coupon interest discounted at a rate appro  priate for the risk assumed  Such a definition presumes a period of time over which  an investor anticipates holding an asset  known as the holding period  The investor  forecasts the price expected to prevail at the end of the holding period as well as any  cash flows that are expected to be earned over the holding period  He then takes  that predicted future price and expected cash flows and finds their current value by  discounting them to the present   Thereby the investor arrives at a fundamental value  for the asset and will compare that value with its current market price  Based on any  differential relative to the cost of trading and his confidence in his valuation model  he will make a decision about whether to trade 
6,69,      The Formation of Expectations
7,69,Let us first assume that the underlying does not pay interest or dividends  nor does  it have any other cash flows attributable to holding the asset   Exhibit   illustrates the  basic idea behind the valuation process   Using a probability distribution the investor  forecasts the future over a holding period spanning time   to time T  The center of  the distribution is the expected price of the asset at time T  which we denote as E ST   and represents the investor  s prediction of the spot price at T  The investor knows  there is risk  so this prediction is imperfect hence the reason for the probability  distribution  Nonetheless  at time   the investor makes her best prediction of the spot  price at time T which becomes the foundation for determining what she perceives  to be the value of the asset   
8,69,  This is a good example of why it is best not to use the term  underlying asset  when speaking of derivatives    Not all derivatives have underlying assets  but all have underlyings  some of which are not assets   Some  other examples of non  asset underlyings used in derivatives are weather insurance claims  and shipping  rates   There are also some derivatives in which the underlying is another derivative    The distribution shown here is symmetrical and relatively similar to a normal distribution but this  characterization is for illustrative purposes only  We are making no assumptions about symmetry or  normality at this point

8,70,      The Required Rate of Return on the Underlying Asset
9,70,To determine the value of the asset  this prediction must be converted into its price or  present value  The specific procedure is to discount this expected future price but that  is the easy part   Determining the rate at which to discount the expected future price  is the hard part   We use the symbol k to denote this currently unknown discount rate  which is often referred to as the required rate of return and sometimes the expected  rate of return or just the expected return  At a minimum that rate will include the  risk  free rate of interest  which we denote as r  This rate represents the opportunity  cost  or so  called time value of money and reflects the price of giving up your money  today in return for receiving more money later 
10,70,      The Risk Aversion of the Investor
11,70,At this point  we must briefly discuss an important characteristic of investors   their  degree of risk aversion  We can generally characterize three potential types of investors  by how they feel about risk   risk averse risk neutral or risk seeking   Risk  neutral investors are willing to engage in risky investments for which they  expect to earn only the risk  free rate  Thus  they do not expect to earn a premium  for bearing risk   For risk  averse investors  however risk is undesirable so they do not  consider the risk  free rate an adequate return to compensate them for the risk   Thus   risk  averse investors require a risk premium which is an increase in the expected  return that is sufficient to justify the acceptance of risk   All things being equal an  investment with a higher risk premium will have a lower price  It is very important  to understand however that risk premiums are not automatically earned  They are  merely expectations   Actual outcomes can differ  Clearly stocks that decline in value  did not earn risk premiums  even though someone obviously bought them with the  expectation that they would  Nonetheless  risk premiums must exist in the long run  or risk  averse investors would not accept the risk   The third type of investor is one we must mention but do not treat as realistic  Risk  seekers are those who prefer risk over certainty and will pay more to invest when there  is risk  implying a negative risk premium  We almost always assume that investors  prefer certainty over uncertainty so we generally treat a risk  seeking investor as just  a theoretical possibility and not a practical reality  
12,70,  People who gamble in casinos or play lotteries appear to be risk  seekers  given the advantage of the  casino or the lottery organizer but they are merely earning utility from the game itself not necessarily  from the expected financial outcome

3,71,We will assume that investors are risk averse  To justify taking risk  risk  averse  investors require a risk premium  We will use the Greek symbol    lambda  to denote  the risk premium

13,71,      Other Benefits and Costs of Holding an Asset
14,71,Many assets generate benefits and some incur costs to their owners   Some of these  costs are monetary and others are nonmonetary  The dividends paid by companies  and coupon interest paid by borrowers on their bonds represent obvious benefits to  the holders of these securities   With currencies representing investments that earn the  risk  free rate in a foreign country they too generate benefits in the form of interest    Barring default  interest payments on bonds and currencies are relatively certain  so we will treat them as such  Dividend payments are not certain but dividends do  tend to be fairly predictable  As such we will make an assumption common to most  derivative models that dividends are certain   There is substantial evidence that some commodities generate a benefit that is  somewhat opaque and difficult to measure  This benefit is called the convenience  yield  It represents a nonmonetary advantage of holding the asset   For most financial  assets  convenience yields are either nonexistent or extremely limited  Financial assets  do not possess beauty that might make a person enjoy owning them just to look at  them  Convenience yields are primarily associated with commodities and generally  exist as a result of difficulty in either shorting the commodity or unusually tight sup  plies   For example if a commodity cannot be sold short without great difficulty or  cost  the holder of the commodity has an advantage if market conditions suggest that  the commodity should be sold  Also if a commodity is in short supply the holders of  the commodity can sometimes extract a price premium that is believed by some to  be higher than what would be justified in well  functioning markets   The spot price  of the commodity could even be above the market s expectation of its future price a  condition that would seem to imply a negative expected return  This scenario raises  the question of why anyone would want to hold the commodity if its expected return  is negative  The convenience yield provides a possible explanation that attributes an
15,71,  Although the risk  free rate is invariant with a country  s economy the risk premium varies with the  amount of risk taken  Thus  while the risk  free rate is the same when applied to every investment  the risk  premium is not the same for every investment     Some derivative models incorporate uncertain dividends and interest  but those are beyond the scope  of this introductory reading

4,73,Pricing the Spot Asset
5,73,  Which of the following factors does not affect the spot price of an asset  that has no interim costs or benefits  A The time value of money B The risk aversion of investors C The price recently paid by other investors   Which of the following does not represent a benefit of holding an asset  A The convenience yield B An optimistic expected outlook for the asset C Dividends if the asset is a stock or interest if the asset is a bond
6,73,Solution to   
7,73,C is correct   The price recently paid by other investors is past information and  does not affect the spot price  The time value of money and the risk aversion of  investors determine the discount rate  Only current information is relevant as  investors look ahead not back  
8,73,Solution to   
9,73,B is correct   An optimistic forecast for the asset is not a benefit of holding the  asset  but it does appear in the valuation of the asset as a high expected price  at the horizon date  Convenience yields and dividends and interest are benefits  of holding the asset  
10,73,To recap although the various underlyings differ with respect to the specifics  of pricing  all of them are based on expectations  risk  and the costs and benefits of  holding a specific underlying   Understanding how assets are priced in the spot mar  ket is critical to understanding how derivatives are priced  To understand derivative  pricing  it is necessary to establish a linkage between the derivative market and the  spot market   That linkage occurs through arbitrage 
11,73,    The Principle of Arbitrage
12,73,Arbitrage is a type of transaction undertaken when two assets or portfolios produce  identical results but sell for different prices   If a trader buys the asset or portfolio at  the cheaper price and sells it at the more expensive price she will generate a net inflow  of funds at the start   Because the two assets or portfolios produce identical results   a long position in one and a short position in the other means that at the end of the  holding period the payoffs offset   Hence no money is gained or lost at the end of  the holding period so there is no risk   The net effect is that the arbitrageur receives  money at the start and never has to pay out any money later  Such a situation amounts  to free money like walking down the street  finding money on the ground and never  having to give it up  Exhibit   illustrates this process for assets A and B which have  no dividends or other benefits or costs and pay off identically but sell for different  prices  with S  A   S  B

16,74,      The  In Frequency of Arbitrage Opportunities
17,74,When arbitrage opportunities exist  traders exploit them very quickly  The combined  actions of many traders engaging in the same transaction of buying the low  priced  asset or portfolio and selling the high  priced asset or portfolio results in increased  demand and an increasing price for the former and decreased demand and a decreas  ing price for the latter  This market activity will continue until the prices converge   Assets that produce identical results can thus have only one true market price  This  rule is called the  law of one price   With virtually all market participants alert for the  possibility of earning such profits at no risk  it should not be surprising that arbitrage  opportunities are rare  In practice prices need not converge precisely or even all that quickly because the  transaction cost of exploiting an opportunity could exceed the benefit   For example  say you are walking down the sidewalk of the Champs   lys es in Paris and notice a     coin on the sidewalk   You have a bad back  and it would take some effort to bend over   The transaction cost of exploiting this opportunity without any risk could exceed the  benefit of the money  Some arbitrage opportunities represent such small discrepancies  that they are not worth exploiting because of transaction costs   Significant arbitrage opportunities  however will be exploited  A significant oppor  tunity arises from a price differential large enough to overcome the transaction costs    Any such price differential will continue to be exploited until the opportunity disap  pears   Thus  if you find a     note on the Champs   lys es sidewalk  there is a good  chance you will find it worth picking up  even with your bad back  and even if you  do not pick it up it will probably not be there for long   With enough people alert for  such opportunities  only a few will arise and the ones that do will be quickly exploited  and disappear  In this manner arbitrage makes markets work much more efficiently 
18,74,      Arbitrage and Derivatives
19,74,It may be difficult to conceive of many investments that would produce identical  payoffs   Even similar companies such as McDonalds and Burger King  which are in  the same line of business  do not perform identically  Their performance may be cor  related but each has its own unique characteristics   For equity securities and with no  derivatives involved about the only such situation that could exist in reality is a stock  that trades simultaneously in two different markets  such as Royal Dutch Shell which  trades in Amsterdam and London but is a single company  Clearly there can be only  one price  If those two markets operate in different currencies  the currency  adjusted  prices should be the same  Bonds issued by the same borrower are also potentially  arbitrageable  All bonds of an issuer will be priced off of the term structure of interest  rates   Because of this common factor bonds of different maturities can be arbitraged  against each other  But in general two securities are unlikely to perform identically 
1,75,  
2,75,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,75,The picture changes  however if we introduce derivatives   For most derivatives   the payoffs come  derive  directly from the value of the underlying at the expiration  of the derivative  Although no one can predict with certainty the value of the under  lying at expiration as soon as that value is determined the value of the derivative at  expiration becomes certain  So while the performance of McDonalds  stock may have  a strong correlation to the performance of Burger King  s stock  neither completely  determines the other  But derivatives on McDonalds  stock and derivatives on Burger  King  s stock are completely determined by their respective stocks   All of the uncer  tainty in a derivative comes from the uncertainty in the underlying   As a result  the  price of the derivative is tied to the price of the underlying   That being the case the  derivative can be used to hedge the underlying  or vice versa   Exhibit    illustrates this point   When a long position in the underlying is com  bined with a short position in the derivative to produce a perfect hedge all of the  risk is eliminated and the position should earn the risk  free rate  If not  arbitrageurs  begin to trade  If the position generates a return in excess of the risk  free rate the  arbitrageurs see an opportunity because the hedged position of the underlying  long  asset and short derivative  earns more than the risk  free rate and a risk  free loan  undertaken as a borrower incurs a cost equal to the risk  free rate  Therefore imple  menting the hedged position and borrowing at the risk  free rate earns a return in  excess of the risk  free rate incurs a cost of the risk  free rate and has no risk   As a  result  an investor can earn excess return at no risk without committing any capital   Arbitrageurs will execute this transaction in large volumes  continuing to exploit the  pricing discrepancy until market forces push prices back in line such that both risk   free transactions earn the risk  free rate

10,75,Out of this process  one and only one price can exist for the derivative  Otherwise  there will be an arbitrage opportunity  We typically take the underlying price as given  and infer the unique derivative price that prohibits any arbitrage opportunities   Most  derivatives pricing models are established on this foundation  We simply assume that  no arbitrage opportunities can exist and infer the derivative price that guarantees  there are no arbitrage opportunities  
11,75,      Arbitrage and Replication
12,75,Because a long asset and a short derivative on the asset can be combined to produce  a position equivalent to a risk  free bond it follows that the long asset and a short  risk  free asset  meaning to borrow at the risk  free rate  can be combined to produce  a long derivative  Alternatively a short derivative and the short risk  free asset can be  combined to produce a short asset position  Exhibit   shows this process  referred to  as replication  Replication is the creation of an asset or portfolio from another asset   portfolio and or derivative

13,76,If all assets are correctly priced to prohibit arbitrage however the ability to rep  licate seems useless   Why would one replicate an asset or derivative if there is no  cost advantage  Buying a government security to earn the risk  free rate is easier than  buying the asset and selling a derivative to produce a risk  free position  At this point   that is certainly a reasonable question  As we progress through this material however  we will relax the assumption that everything is always correctly priced and we will  admit the possibility of occasional arbitrage opportunities   For example it may be  more profitable to hedge a portfolio with a derivative to produce a risk  free rate than  to invest in the risk  free asset   In addition we might find that replication can have  lower transaction costs   For example a derivative on a stock index combined with the  risk  free asset  Long derivative  Stock index futures    Long risk  free asset  Lending     Long asset  Stock index   can potentially replicate an index fund at lower transaction  costs than buying all the securities in the index   Replication is the essence of arbitrage   The ability to replicate something with something else can be valuable to investors   either through pricing differentials  however temporary or lower transaction costs  
14,76,      Risk Aversion Risk Neutrality and Arbitrage  Free Pricing
15,76,Most investors are risk averse  They do not accept risk without the expectation of a  return commensurate with that risk   Thus  they require risk premiums to justify the  risk   One might think that this point implies a method for pricing derivatives based  on the application of a risk premium to the expected payoff of the derivative and its  risk   As we will describe later this methodology is not appropriate in the pricing of  derivatives   As previously described a derivative can be combined with an asset to produce a  risk  free position  This fact does not mean that one should create such a combination   It merely means that one can do so  The derivative price is the price that guarantees  the risk  free combination of the derivative and the underlying produces a risk  free  return  The derivative price can then be inferred from the characteristics of the under  lying  the characteristics of the derivative and the risk  free rate  The investor  s risk  aversion is not a factor in determining the derivative price  Because the risk aversion  of the investor is not relevant to pricing the derivative one can just as easily obtain  the derivative price by assuming that the investor is risk neutral  That means that the  expected payoff of the derivative can be discounted at the risk  free rate rather than  the risk  free rate plus a risk premium  Virtually all derivative pricing models ultimately  take this form  discounting the expected payoff of the derivative at the risk  free rate  The entire process of pricing derivatives is not exactly as we have described it at  this point   There is an intermediate step which entails altering the probabilities of the  outcomes from the true probabilities to something called risk  neutral probabilities   We  will illustrate this process later in this reading   The important point to understand is
1,77,  
2,77,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,77,that while the risk aversion of investors is relevant to pricing assets  it is not relevant  to pricing derivatives   As such derivatives pricing is sometimes called risk  neutral  pricing  Risk  neutral pricing uses the fact that arbitrage opportunities guarantee that  a risk  free portfolio consisting of the underlying and the derivative must earn the risk   free rate  There is only one derivative price that meets that condition  Any mispricing  of the derivative will lead to arbitrage transactions that drive the derivative price back  to where it should be the price that eliminates arbitrage opportunities   The overall process of pricing derivatives by arbitrage and risk neutrality is called  arbitrage   free pricing  We are effectively determining the price of a derivative by  assuming that the market is free of arbitrage opportunities   This notion is also some  times called the principle of no arbitrage  If there are no arbitrage opportunities   combinations of assets and or derivatives that produce the same results must sell  for the same price  The correct derivative price assures us that the market is free of  arbitrage opportunities  
4,77,      Limits to Arbitrage
5,77,As we previously described there may be reasons to not pick up a coin lying on the  ground  Likewise some small arbitrage profits are never exploited  A bond selling  for       might offer an arbitrage profit by trading a derivative on the bond and a  risk  free asset at a total cost of      but the profit of    might be exceeded by the  transaction costs   Such small differentials can easily remain essentially trapped within  the bounds of transaction costs   In addition arbitrage can require capital  Not everyone  can borrow virtually unlimited amounts of money at what amounts to a risk  free rate   Moreover some transactions can require additional capital to maintain positions   The  corresponding gains from an offsetting position might not be liquid  Hence on paper  the position is hedged but in practice one position has a cash outflow while the other  generates gains on paper that are realized only later  Borrowing against those future  gains is not always easy  Moreover some apparent arbitrage transactions are not completely risk free  As  you will learn later option pricing requires knowledge of the volatility of the under  lying asset  which is information that is not easy to obtain and subject to different  opinions   Executing an arbitrage can entail risk if one lacks accurate information on  the model inputs   Some arbitrage positions require short  selling assets that can be difficult to short    Some securities are held only by investors who are unwilling to lend the securities  and who by policy are not arbitrageurs themselves   Some commodities  in particular  can be difficult and costly to sell short   Hence the arbitrage might exist in only one  direction which keeps the price from becoming seemingly too high or seemingly  too low but permitting it to move virtually without limit in the opposite direction  Arbitrage positions rely on the ultimate realization by other investors of the  existence of the mispricing   For some investors  bearing these costs and risks until  other investors drive the price back to its appropriate level can be nearly impossible  The arbitrage principle is the essence of derivative pricing models   Yet  clearly  there are limits to the ability of all investors to execute arbitrage transactions   In  studying derivative pricing  it is important to accept the no  arbitrage rule as a par  adigm meaning a framework for analysis and understanding   Although no market  experts think that arbitrage opportunities never occur it is a common belief that  finding and exploiting them is a challenging and highly competitive process that will  not yield frequent success   But it is important that market participants stay alert for  and exploit whatever arbitrage opportunities arise  In response the market functions  more efficiently

4,78,Arbitrage
5,78,  Which of the following best describes an arbitrage opportunity  It is an  opportunity to  A earn a risk premium in the short run  B buy an asset at less than its fundamental value  C make a profit at no risk with no capital invested    What most likely happens when an arbitrage opportunity exists  A  Investors trade quickly and prices adjust to eliminate the opportunity  B Risk premiums increase to compensate traders for the additional risk   C Markets cease operations to eliminate the possibility of profit at no  risk     Which of the following best describes how derivatives are priced  A A hedge portfolio is used that eliminates arbitrage opportunities   B The payoff of the underlying is adjusted downward by the derivative  value  C The expected future payoff of the derivative is discounted at the risk   free rate plus a risk premium    An investor who requires no premium to compensate for the assumption  of risk is said to be which of the following  A Risk seeking B Risk averse C Risk neutral   Which of the following is a limit to arbitrage  A Clearinghouses restrict the transactions that can be arbitraged  B Pricing models do not show whether to buy or sell the derivative  C  It may not always be possible to raise sufficient capital to engage in  arbitrage 
6,78,Solution to   
7,78,C is correct because it is the only answer that is based on the notion of when  an arbitrage opportunity exists   when two identical assets or portfolios sell  for different prices   A risk premium earned in the short run can easily have  occurred through luck   Buying an asset at less than fair value might not even  produce a profit  
8,78,Solution to   
9,78,A is correct  The combined actions of traders push prices back in line to a level at  which no arbitrage opportunities exist  Markets certainly do not shut down and  risk premiums do not adjust and in fact  have no relevance to arbitrage profits  
10,78,Solution to   
11,78,A is correct   A hedge portfolio is formed that eliminates arbitrage opportunities  and implies a unique price for the derivative  The other answers are incorrect  because the underlying payoff is not adjusted by the derivative value and the  discount rate of the derivative does not include a risk premium 
1,79,  
2,79,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,79,Solution to   
4,79,C is correct  Risk  seeking investors give away a risk premium because they enjoy  taking risk   Risk  averse investors expect a risk premium to compensate for the  risk   Risk  neutral investors neither give nor receive a risk premium because they  have no feelings about risk  
5,79,Solution to   
6,79,C is correct   It may not always be possible to raise sufficient capital to engage in  arbitrage  Clearinghouses do not restrict arbitrage  Pricing models show what  the price of the derivative should be  Thus  comparison with the market price will indicate if the derivative is  overpriced and should be sold or if it is underpriced and should be purchased 
7,79,    The Concept of Pricing vs  Valuation
8,79,In equity markets  analysis is undertaken with the objective of determining the value  sometimes called the fundamental value of a stock   When a stock trades in the market  for a price that differs from its fundamental value investors will often buy or sell the  stock based on the perceived mispricing   The fundamental value of a stock is typically  determined by analyzing the company  s financial statements  projecting its earnings  and dividends  determining a discount rate based on the risk  and finding the present  value of the future dividends   These steps make up the essence of dividend discount  models   Other approaches include comparing the book value of a company to its market  value thereby using book value as a proxy for fundamental value or by application  of a price earnings ratio to projected next  period earnings  or by discounting free  cash flow  Each of these approaches purports to estimate the company  s fundamental  value leading to the notion that a company is worth something that may or may not  correspond to its price in the market   In derivative markets  the notion of valuation as a representation of fundamental  value is still a valid concept  but the terminology can be somewhat different and can  lead to some confusion  Options are not a problem in this regard  They can be analyzed  to determine their fundamental value and the market price can be compared with the  fundamental value  Any difference can then presumably be exploited via arbitrage   The combined actions of numerous investors should ultimately lead to the market  price converging to its fundamental value subject to the above limits to arbitrage  The world of forwards  futures  and swaps  however uses different terminology  with respect to price and value  These contracts do not require the outlay of cash at  the start the way an option stock  or bond does   Forwards  futures  and swaps start off  with values of zero  Then as the underlying moves  their values become either positive  or negative  The forward futures  or swap price is a concept that represents the fixed  price or rate at which the underlying will be purchased at a later date  It is not an  amount to be paid at the start   This fixed price or rate is embedded into the contract  while the value will fluctuate as market conditions change  But more importantly the  value and price are not at all comparable with each other  Consider a simple example  Suppose you own a stock priced at       You have  a short forward contract to sell the stock at a price of      one year from now  The  risk  free rate is     Your position is riskless because you know that one year from now  you will sell the stock for       Thus  you know you will get      one year from now  which has a present value of                       Notice the discounting at the risk   free rate which is appropriate because the position is riskless   Your overall position is  that you own an asset worth      and are short a contract worth something  and the  two positions combine to have a value of         Therefore the forward contract must  have a value of                         Your forward contract is thus worth         To

3,80,the party on the opposite side it is worth          The price of the forward contract  is still      which was set when you created the contract at an earlier date  As you  can see the      forward price is not comparable to the       value of the contract   Although the forward price is fixed any new forward contract calling for delivery  of the same asset at the same time will have a different price  We will cover that point  in more detail later  For now it is important to see that your contract has a price of       but a value of        which are two entirely different orders of magnitude  This  information does not imply that the forward contract is mispriced  The value is the  amount of wealth represented by owning the forward contract   The price is one of  the terms the parties agreed on when they created the contract    This idea applies in  the same manner for futures and swaps  
4,80,PRICING AND VALUATION OF FORWARD  COMMITMENTS
5,80, 
6,80,In this section we will go into pricing forward commitments in a little more detail   Let us start by establishing that today at time   we create a forward commitment that  expires at time T  The value of the underlying today is S   At expiration the underlying  value is ST which is not known at the initiation of the contract  
7,80,    Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts
8,80,Previously we noted that price and value are entirely different concepts for forward  commitments   We gave an example of a forward contract with a price of      but a  value of        to the seller and        to the buyer  In the next subsection we will  delve more deeply into understanding these concepts of pricing and valuation for  forward contracts  
9,80,      Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts at Expiration
10,80,Recall that a forward contract specifies that one party agrees to buy the underlying  from the other at the expiration date at a price agreed on at the start of the contract    Suppose that you enter into a contract with another party in which you will buy a  used car from that party in one year at a price of         Then        is the forward  price  One year later when the contract expires  you are committed to paying         and accepting delivery of the car  Let us say that at that time you check the used car  market and find that an identical car is worth         How much is your forward  contract worth to you at that time  It obligates you to pay        for a car that you  would otherwise have to pay         Thus  the contract benefits you by      so its  value is       If you were on the opposite side of the transaction its value would be         If the market price of the car were below        the contract would have  negative value to you and the mirror image positive value to the seller 
11,80,  This concept of the value of the forward contract as it evolves toward expiration is sometimes referred  to as its mark  to  market value  The same notion is applicable to swaps   In futures  of course contracts are  automatically marked to market by the clearinghouse and gains and losses are converted into actual cash  flows from one party to the other    The forward price is more like the exercise price of the option  It is the price the two parties agree will  be paid at a future date for the underlying   Of course the option has the feature that the holder need not  ever pay that price which is the case if the holder chooses not to exercise the option 
1,81,  
2,81,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,81,   
4,81,This example leads us to our first important derivative pricing result   The forward  price established at the initiation date of contract is F  T   Let us denote the value at  expiration of the forward contract as V T T   This value is formally stated as V T T    ST   F  T    In words  The value of a forward contract at expiration is the spot price of the under  lying minus the forward price agreed to in the contract   In the financial world we generally define value as the value to the long position so  the above definition is generally correct but would be adjusted if we look at the trans   action from the point of view of the short party  In that case we would multiply the  value to the long party by    to calculate the value to the short party  Alternatively  the value to the short party is the forward price minus the spot price at expiration  If a forward contract could be initiated right at the instant of expiration the  forward price would clearly be the spot price  Such a contract would essentially be a  spot transaction 
5,81,      Pricing and Valuation at Initiation Date
6,81,In Exhibit   we see the nature of the problem of pricing a forward contract   We are  situated at time   facing an uncertain future  At the horizon date time T the under  lying price will be ST  Of course at time   we do not know what ST will turn out to  be  Yet at time   we need to establish the forward price F  T  which is the price we  agree to pay at time T to purchase the asset

13,81,   
14,81,When a forward contract is initiated neither party pays anything to the other  It is a  valueless contract neither an asset nor a liability  Therefore its value at initiation is zero  V  T        The forward price that the parties agree to at the initiation date of the contract is  a special price that results in the contract having zero value and prohibiting arbitrage   This is our first important result   Because neither the long nor the short pays anything to the other at the  initiation date of a forward contract  the value of a forward contract when  initiated is zero  If this statement were not true and one party paid a sum of money to the other  the party receiving the money could find another party and engage in the opposite  transaction with no money paid to the other on this second contract   The two trans  actions would completely offset thereby eliminating the risk   Yet the first party would  have captured some cash from the second and consequently earned an arbitrage  profit because his position is completely hedged  He would walk away with money

3,82,and never have to worry about paying it back   The forward price is the price the two  parties agree on that generates a value of zero at the initiation date  Finding that price  is actually quite easy  Consider a very simple asset price at S  today that pays no dividends or interest   nor does it yield any nonfinancial benefits or incur any carrying costs   As described  earlier we can peer into the future but at best we can make only a forecast of the  price of this asset at our horizon date of time T  That forecast was previously referred  to as the expected spot price at expiration E ST   On the surface it might seem that  pricing a forward contract would somehow involve a discounting of the expected  spot price  As we said earlier however that is not how derivatives are priced they  are priced using arbitrage  Suppose we hold the asset and enter into a forward contract to sell the asset at the  price F  T   It should be easy to see that we have constructed a risk  free position  We  know that the asset  currently worth S  will be sold later at F  T  and that this price  should guarantee a risk  free return  Thus  we should find the following relationship

14,82,We can easily solve for the forward price to obtain F  T    S      r T   Or in words  The forward price is the spot price compounded at the risk  free rate over  the life of the contract   There is a nice logic to this relationship  While the spot price is what someone  would have to pay today to buy the asset  a forward contract locks in the purchase  price at the horizon date  When that date arrives  the investor will own the asset    Instead of buying the asset today suppose the investor uses the forward contract to  guarantee that she will own the asset at the horizon date  By using the forward con  tract  the investor will not have committed the money S  that would have forgone  interest at the rate r for the period   to T  Notice how the risk premium on the asset  does not directly appear in the pricing relationship  It does appear implicitly because  it determines the spot price paid to buy the asset   Knowing the spot price however  eliminates the necessity of determining the risk premium  The derivatives market can  simply let the spot market derive the risk premium  As a simple example let us say the underlying price S  is     the risk  free rate r  is    and the contract expires in three months  meaning that T                Then  the forward price is                         Thus  the two parties would agree that  the buyer will pay        to the seller in three months  and the seller will deliver the  underlying to the buyer at expiration  Now suppose the asset generates cash payments and or benefits and incurs stor  age costs   As we discussed the net cost of carry consists of the benefits  denoted as     dividends or interest plus convenience yield  minus the costs  denoted as   both  of which are in present value form  To put these concepts in future value form we  simply compound them at the risk  free rate             r T  Because this is their value  at the expiration date of the contract  we can add them to F  T  in Equation   thereby  restating that equation as

35,83,We see that the forward price determined using Equation   is reduced by the future  value of any benefits and increased by the future value of any costs   In other words  The forward price of an asset with benefits and or costs is the spot price  compounded at the risk  free rate over the life of the contract minus the  future value of those benefits and costs  Again the logic is straightforward  To acquire a position in the asset at time T  an investor could buy the asset today and hold it until time T  Alternatively he could  enter into a forward contract  committing him to buying the asset at T at the price  F  T   He would end up at T holding the asset  but the spot transaction would yield  benefits and incur costs  whereas the forward transaction would forgo the benefits  but avoid the costs   Assume the benefits exceed the costs   Then the forward transaction would return  less than the spot transaction  The formula adjusts the forward price downward by the  expression              r T to reflect this net loss over the spot transaction  In other  words  acquiring the asset in the forward market would be cheaper because it forgoes  benefits that exceed the costs   That does not mean the forward strategy is better  It  costs less but also produces less   Alternatively if the costs exceeded the benefits  the  forward price would be higher because the forward contract avoids the costs at the  expense of the lesser benefits   Returning to our simple example suppose the present value of the benefits is         and the present value of the costs is         The forward price would be                                                The forward price which was        without these costs  and benefits  is now higher because the carrying costs exceed the benefits   The value of the contract when initiated is zero provided the forward price con  forms to the appropriate pricing formula   To keep the analysis as simple as possible  consider the case in which the asset yields no benefits and incurs no costs   Going  long the forward contract or going long the asset produces the same position at T   ownership of the asset   Nonetheless  the strategies are not equivalent   Going long the  forward contract enables the investor to avoid having to pay the price of the asset  S   so she would collect interest on the money  Thus  the forward strategy would have a  value of S  reflecting the investment of that much cash invested in risk  free bonds   plus the value of the forward contract   The spot strategy would have a value of S   reflecting the investment in the asset   These two strategies must have equal values    Hence the value of the forward contract must be zero  Although a forward contract has zero value at the start  it will not have zero value  during its life  We now take a look at what happens during the life of the contract  
36,83,      Pricing and Valuation during the Life of the Contract
37,83,We previously worked an example in which a forward contract established with a price  of      later has a value of        to the seller and        to the buyer  Generally we  would say the value is        We explained that with the spot price at      a party  that is long the asset and short the forward contract would guarantee the sale of the  asset priced at      at a price of      in one year  The present value of      in one  year at    is         Thus  the party guarantees that his      asset will be effectively  sold at a present value of        for a present value loss of        In general we can say that

4,84,The value of a forward contract is the spot price of the underlying asset  minus the present value of the forward price   Again the logic is simple  A forward contract provides a type of synthetic posi  tion in the asset  for which we promise to pay the forward price at expiration  Thus   the value of the forward contract is the value of the asset minus the present value of  the forward price  Let us write out this relationship using Vt T  as the value of the  forward contract at time t which is some point in time after the contract is initiated  and before it expires   Vt T    St   F  T      r   T t    Note that we are working with the spot price at t but the forward price was fixed  when the contract was initiated   Now recall the problem we worked in which the underlying had a price of      and the contract was initiated with a three  month life at a price of         Move one  month later so that the remaining time is two months   T   t                 Let the  underlying price be      The value of the contract would be                                    If the asset has a cost of carry we must make only a small adjustment   Vt T    St               r t   F  T      r   T t    Note how we adjust the formula by the net of benefits minus costs   The forward  contract forgoes the benefits and avoids the costs of holding the asset   Consequently  we adjust the value downward to reflect the forgone benefits and upward to reflect  the avoided costs   Remember that the costs     and benefits     are expressed on a  present value basis as of time    We need their value at time t  We could compound  them from   to T and then discount them back to t by the period T   t but a shorter  route is to simply compound them from   to t  In the problem we previously worked  in which we priced the forward contract when the asset has costs and benefits  the  benefits     were    and the costs     were    giving us a forward price of          We have now moved one month ahead so t                  and T   t                   Hence the value of the forward contract would be                                                            In this case the effect of the compounding of the net  of costs and benefits      over one month has no appreciable effect on the value but  that result is not a general rule   It is important to note that although we say that Equation   holds during the life of  the contract at some arbitrary time t it also holds at the initiation date and at expira  tion  For the initiation date we simply change t to   in Equation    Then we substitute  Equation   for F  T  in Equation   obtaining V  T      confirming that the value of  a forward contract at initiation is zero  At expiration we let t   T in Equation   and  obtain the spot price minus the forward price as presented in Equation

6,84,      A Word about Forward Contracts on Interest Rates
7,84,Forward contracts in which the underlying is an interest rate are called forward rate  agreements or FRAs   These instruments differ slightly from most other forward  contracts in that the underlying is not an asset   Changes in interest rates  such as the  value of an asset  are unpredictable  Moreover virtually every company and organi  zation is affected by the uncertainty of interest rates   Hence FRAs are very useful  devices for many companies   FRAs are forward contracts that allow participants to
8,84,  An alternative approach to valuing a forward contract during its life is to determine the price of a new  forward contract that would offset the old one  The discounted difference between the new forward price  and the original forward price will lead to the same value     You might be wondering whether the cost and benefit terms disappear when t   T  With the costs and  benefits defined as those incurred over the period t to T at expiration their value is zero by definition

3,85,make a known interest payment at a later date and receive in return an unknown  interest payment  In that way a participant whose business will involve borrowing at a  future date can hedge against an increase in interest rates by buying an FRA  the long  side  and locking in a fixed payment and receiving a random payment that offsets the  unknown interest payment it will make on its loan  Note that the FRA seller  the short  side  is hedging against a decrease in interest rates   Also consider that the FRA seller  could be a lender wishing to lock in a fixed rate on a loan it will make at a future date  Even though FRAs do not involve an underlying asset  they can still be combined  with an underlying asset to produce a hedged position thereby leading to fairly  straightforward pricing and valuation equations   The math is a little more complex  than the math for forwards on assets  but the basic ideas are the same  FRAs are often based on Libor the London Interbank Offered Rate which rep  resents the rate on a Eurodollar time deposit  a loan in dollars from one London  bank to another    As an example assume we are interested in going long a     day  FRA with a fixed rate  the FRA rate  in which the underlying is     day Libor  A long  position means that in    days  we will make a known interest payment and receive an  interest payment corresponding to the discounted difference between     day Libor on  that day and the FRA rate  We can either enter into a     day FRA on     day Libor or  create a synthetic FRA   To do the latter we would go long a      day Eurodollar time  deposit and short a     day Eurodollar time deposit   Exhibit   shows the structure of  this strategy  We omit some of the details here such as how much face value we should  take on the two Eurodollar transactions as well as the size of the FRA   Those technical  issues are covered in more advanced material  At this time we focus on the fact that  going long over the      day period and short over the     day period leaves an investor  with no exposure over the     day period and then converts to a position that starts     days from now and matures    days later  This synthetic position corresponds to  a     day FRA on     day Libor  Exhibit   illustrates this point

3,86,FRAs  and indeed all forward contracts relating to bonds and interest rates  are  closely tied to the term structure of interest rates  a concept covered in virtually all  treatments of fixed  income securities   Buying a      day zero  coupon bond and selling  a     day zero  coupon bond produces a forward position in a     day zero  coupon bond  that begins in    days   From that forward position one can infer the forward rate  It  would then be seen that the FRA rate is the forward rate even though the derivative  itself is not a forward contract on a bond 
4,86,EXAMPLE  
5,86,Forward Contract Pricing and Valuation
6,86,  Which of the following best describes the difference between the price of  a forward contract and its value  A The forward price is fixed at the start  and the value starts at zero and  then changes   B The price determines the profit to the buyer and the value determines  the profit to the seller  C The forward contract value is a benchmark against which the price  is compared for the purposes of determining whether a trade is  advisable    Which of the following best describes the value of the forward contract at  expiration  The value is the price of the underlying  A minus the forward price  B divided by the forward price  C minus the compounded forward price    Which of the following factors does not affect the forward price  A The costs of holding the underlying B Dividends or interest paid by the underlying C Whether the investor is risk averse risk seeking  or risk neutral   Which of the following best describes the forward rate of an FRA  A The spot rate implied by the term structure B The forward rate implied by the term structure C The rate on a zero  coupon bond of maturity equal to that of the for  ward contract
7,86,Solution to   
8,86,A is correct   The forward price is fixed at the start  whereas the value starts  at zero and then changes   Both price and value are relevant in determining  the profit for both parties   The forward contract value is not a benchmark for  comparison with the price 
9,86,Solution to   
10,86,A is correct because the holder of the contract gains the difference between  the price of the underlying and the forward price  That value can of course be  negative which will occur if the holder is forced to buy the underlying at a price  higher than the market price

2,87,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,87,Solution to   
4,87,C is correct   The costs of holding the underlying  known as carrying costs  and  the dividends and interest paid by the underlying are extremely relevant to the  forward price  How the investor feels about risk is irrelevant because the forward  price is determined by arbitrage 
5,87,Solution to   
6,87,B is correct  FRAs are based on Libor and they represent forward rates  not spot  rates   Spot rates are needed to determine forward rates  but they are not equal  to forward rates   The rate on a zero  coupon bond of maturity equal to that of  the forward contract describes a spot rate 
7,87,As noted we are not covering the details of derivative pricing but rather are focus   ing on the intuition  At this point  we have covered the intuition of pricing forward  contracts   We now move to futures contracts  
8,87,    Pricing and Valuation of Futures Contracts
9,87,Futures contracts differ from forward contracts in that they have standard terms   are traded on a futures exchange and are more heavily regulated whereas forward  contracts are typically private customized transactions   Perhaps the most import  ant distinction is that they are marked to market on a daily basis  meaning that the  accumulated gains and losses from the previous day  s trading session are deducted  from the accounts of those holding losing positions and transferred to the accounts  of those holding winning positions   This daily settling of gains and losses enables the  futures exchange to guarantee that a party that earns a profit from a futures trans  action will not have to worry about collecting the money  Thus  futures exchanges  provide a credit guarantee which is facilitated through the use of a clearinghouse   The clearinghouse collects and disburses cash flows from the parties on a daily basis   thereby settling obligations quickly before they accumulate to much larger amounts    There is no absolute assurance that a clearinghouse will not fail but none has ever  done so since the first one was created in the     s   The pattern of cash flows in a futures contract is quite similar to that in a forward  contract   Suppose you enter into a forward contract two days before expiration in  which you agree to buy an asset at      the forward price  Two days later the asset is  selling for      and the contract expires   You therefore pay      and receive an asset  worth      for a gain of     If the contract were cash settled instead of involving  physical delivery you would receive    in cash which you could use to defer a portion  of the cost of the asset   The net effect is that you are buying the asset for      paying       plus the    profit on the forward contract   Had you chosen a futures contract  the futures price at expiration would still con  verge to the spot price of       But now it would matter what the futures settlement  price was on the next to last day  Let us assume that price was      That means on the  next to last day your account would be marked to market for a loss of    the price of       having fallen to      That is  you would be charged    with the money passed on  to the opposite party  But then on the last day your position would be marked from      to      a gain of     Your net would be    lost on the first day and    gained on  the second for a total of     In both situations you gain    but with the forward con  tract  you gain it all at expiration whereas with the futures contract  you gain it over  two days   With this two  day example the interest on the interim cash flow would be  virtually irrelevant  but over longer periods and with sufficiently high interest rates   the difference in the amount of money you end up with could be noticeable 
1,88,Pricing and Valuation of Forward Commitments
2,88,  
3,88,The value of a futures contract is the accumulated gain or loss on a futures contract  since its previous day  s settlement  When that value is paid out in the daily settlement  the futures price is effectively reset to the settlement price and the value goes to zero   The different patterns of cash flows for forwards and futures can lead to differences  in the pricing of forwards versus futures   But there are some conditions under which  the pricing is the same  It turns out that if interest rates were constant  forwards and  futures would have the same prices   The differential will vary with the volatility of  interest rates   In addition if futures prices and interest rates are uncorrelated for  wards and futures prices will be the same  If futures prices are positively correlated  with interest rates  futures contracts are more desirable to holders of long positions  than are forwards   The reason is because rising prices lead to futures profits that are  reinvested in periods of rising interest rates  and falling prices leads to losses that  occur in periods of falling interest rates   It is far better to receive cash flows in the  interim than all at expiration under such conditions   This condition makes futures  more attractive than forwards  and therefore their prices will be higher than forward  prices   A negative correlation between futures prices and interest rates leads to the  opposite interpretation with forwards being more desirable than futures to the long  position  The more desirable contract will tend to have the higher price  The practical realities  however are that the derivatives industry makes virtually no  distinction between futures and forward prices     Thus  we will make no distinction  between futures and forward pricing  except possibly in noting some subtle issues  that may arise from time to time 
4,88,EXAMPLE  
5,88,Futures Pricing and Valuation
6,88,  Which of the following best describes how futures contract payoffs differ  from forward contract payoffs  A Forward contract payoffs are larger  B They are equal ignoring the time value of money  C Futures contract payoffs are larger if the underlying is a commodity    Which of the following conditions will not make futures and forward  prices equivalent  A  Interest rates are constant   B Futures prices are uncorrelated with interest rates   C The volatility of the forward price is different from the volatility of the  futures price    With respect to the value of a futures contract  which of the following  statements is most accurate  The value is the  A  futures price minus the spot price  B present value of the expected payoff at expiration  C accumulated gain since the previous settlement  which resets to zero  upon settlement  
7,88,   At the time of this writing  many forwards  and swaps  are being processed through clearinghouses  a  response to changes brought about by key legislation in several countries that was adopted following the  financial crises of       These OTC instruments are thus being effectively marked to market in a similar  manner to the futures contracts described here  The full extent of this evolution of OTC trading through  clearinghouses is not yet clear

2,89,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,89,Solution to   
4,89,B is correct  Forward payoffs occur all at expiration whereas futures payoffs occur  on a day  to  day basis but would equal forward payoffs ignoring interest   Payoffs  could differ so forward payoffs are not always larger  The type of underlying is  not relevant to the point of which payoff is larger 
5,89,Solution to   
6,89,C is correct   Constant interest rates or the condition that futures prices are  uncorrelated with interest rates will make forward and futures prices equivalent   The volatility of forward and futures prices has no relationship to any difference 
7,89,Solution to   
8,89,C is correct   Value accumulates from the previous settlement and goes to zero  when distributed 
9,89,    Pricing and Valuation of Swap Contracts
10,89,Recall the structure of a forward contract  as depicted in Exhibit    The investor is at  time   and needs to determine the price F  T  that she will agree to pay at time T to  purchase the asset   This price is set such that there is no value to the contract at that  time  Value can arise later as prices change but when initiated the contract has zero  value  Neither party pays anything to the other at the start   Now consider a swap starting at time   and ending at time T  We will let this swap  be the type that involves a fixed payment exchanged for a floating payment  The contract  specifies that the two parties will make a series of n payments at times that we will  designate as       n with the last payment occurring at time T  On each of these  payment dates  the owner of the swap makes a payment of FS  n T  and receives a  payment based on the value of the underlying at the time of each respective payment   S  S    Sn  So from the point of view of the buyer the sequence of cash flows from  the swap is S    FS  n T  S    FS  n T    Sn   FS  n T   The notation FS  n T   denotes the fixed payment established at time   for a swap consisting of n payments  with the last payment at time T  We denote the time to each payment as t  t    tn  where tn   T  This structure is shown in Exhibit

29,90,Recall from the material on forward contracts that the forward price is determined  by the spot price and the net cost of carry  Equation     the latter being partially  determined by the length of time of the contract   It should be obvious that a forward  contract expiring at time t  will not have the same price F  t   as a forward contract  expiring at time t  F  t   and likewise for all of the implicit remaining forward con  tracts expiring up through time tn  The cost of carrying an asset over different time  periods will vary by the length of the time periods   In other words  the prices of the  implicit forward contracts imbedded in a swap will not be equal  F  t     F  t         F  tn    But for a swap all the fixed payments are equal  So how can we equate a swap  to a series of forward contracts  It turns out that we can and in doing so we recall a  valuable point about forward pricing   Recall that the forward price is the price that produces a zero value of the contract  at the start   Zero value is essential if there is no exchange of cash flows from one party  to the other  And although no exchange of cash flows is customary it is not mandatory   The parties could agree on any forward price at the start   If the zero  value forward  price were     and the parties agreed on a price of     it should be apparent that  the buyer would be getting a great price  The seller being rational would require that  the buyer compensate him at the start   The seller should be getting     at expiration  and instead will get      So the buyer should compensate the seller to the amount of  the present value of    at expiration  If the parties agree on a price greater than      similar compensation would have to be paid from seller to buyer  A forward transaction that starts with a nonzero value is called an off  market  forward  There is generally no prohibition on the use of off  market forward contracts   so two parties can engage in a series of forward contracts at whatever fixed price they  so desire  Assume they agree on the price FS  T   That is  each forward contract will  be created at the fixed price that corresponds to the fixed price of a swap of the same

3,91,maturity with payments made at the same dates as the series of forward contracts    That means that some of the forward contracts would have positive values and some  would have negative values  but their combined values would equal zero  Now it sounds like that price would be hard to find but it is not   We would not   however go about finding it by taking random guesses   Doing so would take seem  ingly forever  Along the way we would notice that some of these implicit forward  contracts would have positive values and some would have negative values   If the  positives outweighed the negatives  then the overall swap value would be positive  which is too high  Likewise we might plug in a number that would produce an overall  negative value with the implicit forward contract values tending to be predominantly  negative which is too low  Not surprisingly we can find that price easily by appealing to the principle of  arbitrage  We said that the principle of arbitrage will guide us all the way through  derivative pricing   We will omit the details  but here is the general idea   Suppose we buy an asset that pays the amounts S  S    Sn at times t  t    tn   These are unknown amounts   A simple example would be a floating  rate bond for  which the S values represent the coupons that are unknown at the start but ultimately  are determined by the evolution of interest rates   Then suppose we finance the pur  chase of that asset by borrowing money that we promise to repay with equal fixed  payments of FS  T   That strategy replicates the swap  As you have already learned  replication is the key to pricing   Valuation of the swap during its life again appeals to replication and the principle  of no arbitrage  We will find a way to reproduce the remaining payments on the swap  with other transactions   The value of that strategy is the value of the swap  To obtain the fixed rate on the swap or to value it later during its life we will need  information from the market for the underlying   As we previously noted there are  derivatives on bonds and interest rates  equities  currencies  and commodities   It is  not possible to provide a general and simple statement of how to price swaps that  covers all of these cases  but that topic is covered in advanced material

6,92,PRICING AND VALUATION OF OPTIONS
7,92,Unlike a forward futures  or swap contract  an option is clearly an asset to the holder  and a liability to the seller  The buyer of an option pays a sum of money called the  premium and receives the right to buy  a call  or sell  a put  the underlying   The seller  receives the premium and undertakes a potential obligation because the buyer has the  right  but not the obligation to exercise the option  Options are therefore contingent  claims   Pricing the option is the same as assigning its value  Some confusion from  that terminology may still arise in that an option could trade in the market for an  amount that differs from its value  As mentioned there are two general types of options   Calls represent the right  to buy and puts represent the right to sell  There are also two important exercise  characteristics of options   American options allow exercise at any time up to the  expiration while European options allow exercise only at expiration  It is important to  understand that the terms  American  and  European  have no relationship to where  the options are traded  Because the right to exercise can be a complex feature of an  option European options are easier to understand and we will focus on them first   We will use the same notation used with forwards   We start by assuming that  today is time   and the option expires at time T  The underlying is an asset currently  priced at S  and at time T its price is ST  Of course we do not know ST until we get  to the expiration  The option has an exercise or strike price of X  The symbols we use  are as follows   For calls  c    value  price  of European call today cT   value  price  of European call at expiration C    value  price  of American call today  CT   value  price  of American call at expiration For puts  p    value  price  of European put today pT   value  price  of European put at expiration P    value  price  of American put today PT   value  price  of American put at expiration

3,93,      Value of a European Option at Expiration
4,93,   
5,93,Recall that a European call option allows the holder to buy the underlying at expira  tion by paying the exercise price  Therefore exercise is justified only if the value of  the underlying exceeds the exercise price  Otherwise the holder would simply let the  call expire  So if the call is worth exercising  ST   X  the holder pays X and receives  an asset worth ST  Thus  the option is worth ST   X  If the call is not worth exercising   ST   X  the option simply expires and is worth nothing at expiration    Thus  the  value of the option at expiration is the greater of either zero or the underlying price  at expiration minus the exercise price which is typically written as cT   Max  ST   X    This formula is also sometimes referred to as the exercise value or intrinsic value   In this reading  we will use the term exercise value  Taking a simple example if the exercise price is     and the underlying price  is at expiration     the call is worth cT   Max                Max             If  the underlying price at expiration is     the call is worth cT   Max                Max              For puts  the holder has the right to sell the underlying at X  If the underlying is  worth less than X at expiration  X   ST  the put will be exercised and worth X   ST  because it allowed the holder to avoid the loss in value of the asset of that amount   If  the underlying is equal to or worth more than the exercise price at expiration  ST    X  the put will simply expire with no value  So the put is worth the greater of either  zero or the exercise price minus the price of the underlying at expiration  pT   Max  X   ST    As discussed above this formula is referred to as the exercise value or intrinsic value  and as noted we will use the term exercise value  Using the same example as with the call if the underlying is     at expiration the  put is worth pT   Max                Max             If the underlying is     at  expiration the put is worth pT   Max                Max             Thus  the holder of an option looks out into the future and sees these relationships  as the payoff possibilities   That does not mean the holder knows what ST will be but  the holder knows that all of the uncertainty of the option payoff is determined by the  behavior of the underlying   The results of this section can be restated as follows   The value of a European call at expiration is the exercise value  which is  the greater of zero or the value of the underlying minus the exercise price  
6,93,   
7,93,The value of a European put at expiration is the exercise value  which is  the greater of zero or the exercise price minus the value of the underlying  To understand option pricing  we have to work our way forward in a gradual man  ner  The next valuable steps involve using our intuition to identify some characteristics  that will influence the value of the option  We might not be able to quantify their  effects just yet  but we can rationalize why these factors affect the value of an option 
8,93,   In all the remaining material we identify conditions at expiration such as ST   X and ST   X  Here we  merged the equality case  ST   X  with the less  than case      We could have done it the other way around   ST   X and ST   X  which would have had no effect on our interpretations or any calculations of option  value  For convenience in some situations we will use one specification and in some the other

3,94,      Effect of the Value of the Underlying
4,94,The value of the underlying is obviously a critical element in determining the value  of an option  It is the uncertainty of the underlying that provides the motivation for  using options   It is easy to rationalize the direction of the effect of the underlying   A call option can be viewed as a mean of acquiring the underlying  whereas a  put option can be viewed as a means of selling the underlying   Thus  a call option is  logically worth more if the underlying is worth more and a put option is logically  worth more if the underlying is worth less   The value of the underlying also forms one of the boundaries for calls   The value  of a call option cannot exceed the value of the underlying   After all a call option is  only a means of acquiring the underlying   It can never give the holder more benefit  than the underlying   Hence the value of the underlying forms an upper boundary on  what a call is worth  The underlying does not provide an upper or lower boundary  for puts   That role is played by the exercise price as we will see in the next section  To recap what we learned here The value of a European call option is directly related to the value of the  underlying 
5,94,The value of a European put option is inversely related to the value of the  underlying 
6,94,      Effect of the Exercise Price
7,94,The exercise price is a critical factor in determining the value of an option  The exer  cise price is the hurdle beyond which the underlying must go to justify exercise  For  a call the underlying must rise above the exercise price and for a put  the underlying  must fall below the exercise price to justify exercise  When the underlying is beyond  the exercise price in the appropriate direction  higher for a call lower for a put  the  option is said to be in the money  When the underlying is precisely at the exercise  price the option is said to be at the money  When the underlying has not reached  the exercise price  currently lower for a call higher for a put  the option is said to be  out of the money  This characterization of whether the option is in  at  or out  of   the  money is referred to as the option s moneyness  For a call option a lower exercise price has two benefits   One is that there are more  values of the underlying at expiration that are above the exercise price meaning that  there are more outcomes in which the call expires in  the  money  The other benefit  is that assuming the call expires in  the  money for any value of the underlying  the  option value is greater the lower the exercise price  In other words  at expiration the  underlying value ST will be above the exercise price far more often the lower is X   And if ST is indeed higher than X the payoff of ST   X is greater the lower is X  For puts  the effect is just the opposite  To expire in  the  money the value of the  underlying must fall below the exercise price  The higher the exercise price the better  chance the underlying has of getting below it   Likewise if the value of the underlying  does fall below the exercise price the higher the exercise price the greater the payoff   So if X is higher ST will be below it more often and if ST is less than X the payoff of  X   ST is greater the higher is X for whatever value of ST occurs   The exercise price also helps form an upper bound for the value of a European put   If you were holding a European put  the best outcome you could hope for is a zero  value of the underlying   For equities  that would mean complete failure and dissolution

3,95,of the company with shareholders receiving no final payment     In that case the put  would pay X   ST but with ST at zero the put would pay X  If the underlying value  goes to zero during the life of the European put  however the holder cannot collect  that payoff until expiration  Nonetheless  the holder would have a risk  free claim on a  payoff of X at expiration  Thus  the most the put would be worth is the present value  of X meaning X discounted from expiration to the current day at the risk  free rate     Although the holder cannot collect the payoff by exercising the option he could sell  it for the present value of X  To recap these results  The value of a European call option is inversely related to the exercise price  
4,95,The value of a European put option is directly related to the exercise price  
5,95,      Effect of Time to Expiration
6,95,Logic suggests that longer  term options should be worth more than shorter  term  options   That statement is usually true but not always   A call option unquestionably  benefits from additional time  For example the right to buy an asset for     is worth  a lot more if that right is available for two years instead of one  The additional time  provides further opportunity for the underlying to rise above the exercise price   Although that means there is also additional time for the underlying to fall below  the exercise price it hardly matters to the holder of the call because the loss on the  downside is limited to the premium paid  For a European put option the additional time still provides more opportunity  for the underlying price to fall below the exercise price but with the additional risk  of it rising above the exercise price mitigated by the limited loss of the premium if  the put expires out  of  the  money  Thus  it sounds as if puts benefit from longer time  but that is not necessarily true  There is a subtle penalty for this additional time  Put  option holders are awaiting the sale of the underlying  for which they will receive the  exercise price  The longer they have to wait  the lower the present value of the payoff   For some puts  this negative effect can dwarf the positive effect   This situation occurs  with a put the longer the time to expiration the higher the risk  free rate of interest   and the deeper it is in  the  money  The positive effect of time however is somewhat  more dominant   Note that we did not mention this effect for calls   For calls  the holder is waiting  to pay out money at expiration  More time lowers the value of this possible outlay   Hence a longer time period helps call option buyers in this regard  To recap these results  The value of a European call option is directly related to the time to expiration 
7,95,   You might think this point means that people who buy puts are hoping the company goes bankrupt   a seemingly morbid motivation  Yet  put buyers are often people who own the stock and buy the put for  protection  This motivation is no different from owning a house and buying fire insurance  You do not  want the house to burn down  If your sole motivation in buying the insurance were to make a profit on  the insurance you would want the house to burn down  This moral hazard problem illustrates why it is  difficult  if not impossible to buy insurance on a house you do not own  Likewise executives are prohibited  from owning puts on their companies  stock   Individual investors can own puts on stocks they do not own  because they cannot drive the stock price down     For the put holder to truly have a risk  free claim on X at expiration given zero value of the underlying  today the underlying value must go to zero and have no possibility of any recovery  If there is any possi  bility of recovery the underlying value would not go to zero as is often observed when a legal filing for  bankruptcy is undertaken  Many equities do recover  If there were some chance of recovery but the equity  value was zero demand for the stock would be infinite which would push the price up

3,96,The value of a European put option can be either directly or inversely related  to the time to expiration  The direct effect is more common but the inverse  effect can prevail with a put the longer the time to expiration the higher the  risk  free rate  and the deeper it is in  the  money 
4,96,      Effect of the Risk  Free Rate of Interest
5,96,We have already alluded to the effect of the risk  free rate  For call options  a longer time  to expiration means that the present value of the outlay of the exercise price is lower   In other words  with a longer time to expiration the call option holder continues to  earn interest on the money that could be expended later in paying the exercise price  upon exercise of the option  If the option is ultimately never exercised this factor is  irrelevant  but it remains at best a benefit and at worst has no effect   For puts  the  opposite argument prevails   A longer time to expiration with a higher interest rate  lowers the present value of the receipt of the exercise price upon exercise  Thus  the  value today of what the put holder might receive at expiration is lower  If the put is  ultimately never exercised the risk  free rate has no effect   Thus  at best  a higher risk   free rate has no effect on the value of a put   At worst  it decreases the value of the put   These results are summarized as follows   The value of a European call is directly related to the risk  free interest rate  
6,96,The value of a European put is inversely related to the risk  free interest rate  
7,96,      Effect of Volatility of the Underlying
8,96,In studying the pricing of equities  we are conditioned to believe that volatility has a  negative effect   After all investors like return and dislike risk   Volatility is certainly an  element of risk   Therefore volatility is bad for investors  right  Well partially right   First  not all volatility is bad for investors   Unsystematic volatility should be  irrelevant   Investors can hold diversified portfolios   Systematic volatility is clearly  undesirable but do not think that this means that volatility should be completely  avoided where possible  If volatility were universally undesirable no one would take  risks   Clearly risks have to be taken to provide opportunity for reward  With options  volatility of the underlying is  however universally desirable  The  greater the volatility of the underlying  the more an option is worth  This seemingly  counterintuitive result is easy to understand with a little explanation  First  let us make sure we know what volatility really means   In studying asset  returns  we typically represent volatility with the standard deviation of the return  which measures the variation from the average return  The S P     Index has an  approximate long  run volatility of around      Under the assumption of a normal  distribution a standard deviation of     implies that about     of the time the returns  will be within plus or minus one standard deviation of the average  About     of the  time they will be within plus or minus two standard deviations of the average  About      of the time they will be within plus or minus three standard deviations of the  average  When the distribution is non  normal different interpretations apply and  in some extreme cases  the standard deviation can be nearly impossible to interpret   Standard deviation is not the only notion of volatility however and it is not even  needed at this point   You can proceed fairly safely with a measure as simple as the  highest possible value minus the lowest  known as the range  The only requirement  we need right now is that the concept of volatility reflects dispersion how high and  how low the underlying can go 
1,97,  
2,97,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,97,So regardless of how we measure volatility the following conditions will hold    A call option will have a higher payoff the higher the underlying is at expiration    A call option will have a zero payoff if it expires with the underlying below the  exercise price  If we could impose greater volatility on the underlying  we should be able to see that  in Condition   the payoff has a better chance of being greater because the underlying  has a greater possibility of large positive returns   In Condition   however the zero  payoff is unaffected if we impose greater volatility  Expiring more out  of  the  money  is not worse than expiring less out  of  the  money but expiring more in  the  money is  better than expiring less  in  the  money    For puts  we have   A put option will have a higher payoff the lower the underlying is at expiration    A put option will have a zero payoff if it expires with the underlying above the  exercise price  If we could impose greater volatility we would find that it would have a beneficial  effect in     because a larger positive payoff would have a greater chance of occurring    In     the zero payoff is unaffected  The greater of the option expiring more out  of   the  money is irrelevant   Expiring more out  of  the  money is not worse than expiring  less out  of  the  money  Thus  we summarize our results in this section as The value of a European call is directly related to the volatility of the  underlying 
4,97,The value of a European put is directly related to the volatility of the  underlying  The combined effects of time and volatility give rise to the concept of the time  value of an option  The time value of an option is the difference between the market  price of the option and its intrinsic value  It represents the market valuation of the  potential for higher exercise value relative to the potential for lower exercise value  given the volatility of the underlying   Time value of an option is not to be confused  with the time value of money which is the notion of money later being worth less  than money today as a result of the combined effects of time and interest   Time  value results in an option price being greater with volatility and time but declining as  expiration approaches   At expiration no time value remains and the option is worth  only its exercise value  As such an option price is said to decay over time a process  characterized as time value decay which is covered in more advanced material 
5,97,      Effect of Payments on the Underlying and the Cost of Carry
6,97,We previously discussed how payments on the underlying and carrying costs enter  into the determination of forward prices   They also affect option prices   Payments  on the underlying refer to dividends on stocks and interest on bonds   In addition  some commodities offer a convenience yield benefit  Carrying costs include the actual  physical costs of maintaining and or storing an asset   Let us first consider the effect of benefits   Payments of dividends and interest  reduce the value of the underlying   Stocks and bonds fall in value as dividends and  interest are paid  These benefits to holders of these securities do not flow to holders  of options   For call option holders  this reduction is a negative factor  The price of

3,98,the underlying is hurt by such payments  and call holders do not get to collect these  payments   For put holders  the effect is the opposite  When the value of the underlying  is reduced put holders are helped  Carrying costs have the opposite effect   They raise the effective cost of holding or  shorting the asset  Holding call options enables an investor to participate in movements  of the underlying without incurring these costs   Holding put options makes it more  expensive to participate in movements in the underlying than by short selling because  short sellers benefit from carrying costs  which are borne by owners of the asset   To summarize the results from this section A European call option is worth less the more benefits that are paid by the  underlying and worth more the more costs that are incurred in holding the  underlying

5,98,      Lowest Prices of Calls and Puts
6,98,What we have learned so far forms a framework for understanding how European  options are priced  Let us now go a step further and establish a minimum price for  these options   First  we need to look at a call option as similar to the purchase of the underlying  with a portion of the purchase price financed by borrowing   If the underlying is a stock   this transaction is usually called a margin transaction  Assume that the underlying is  worth S   Also assume that you borrow cash in the amount of the present value of X  promising to pay X back T periods later at an interest rate of r  Thus  X      r T is the  amount borrowed and X is the amount to be paid back   Now move forward to time  T and observe the price of the underlying  ST  Upon paying back the loan the overall  strategy will be worth ST   X which can be positive or negative  Next  consider an alternative strategy of buying a call option expiring at T with  an exercise price of X the same value as the face value of the loan  We know that the  option payoffs will be ST   X if it expires in  the  money  ST   X  and zero if not  ST    X   Exhibit    compares these two strategies

17,98,   Note in Exhibit    and in others to come that the inequality   is referred to as out  of  the  money  The  case of equality is technically referred to as at  the  money but the verbiage is simplified if we continue to  call it out  of  the  money  It is certainly not in  the  money and at  the  money is arguably the same as out  of   the  money  Regardless of one s preference the equality case can be attached to either of the two outcomes  with no effect on our conclusions

9,99,When the call expires in  the  money both transactions produce identical payoffs    When the call expires out  of  the  money the call value is zero but the leveraged  transaction is almost surely a loss   Its value ST   X is negative or zero at best  if ST is  exactly equal to X   If two strategies are found to produce equivalent results in some outcomes but one  produces a better result in all other outcomes  then one strategy dominates the former   Here we see that the call strategy dominates the leveraged strategy  Any strategy that  dominates the other can never have a lower value at any time  Why would anyone  pay more for one strategy than for another if the former will never produce a better  result than the latter  Thus  the value of the call strategy c  has to be worth at least  the value of the leveraged transaction S   the value of the asset  minus X       r T   the value of the loan   Hence c    S    X      r T  The inequality means that this statement provides the lowest price of the call but  there is one more thing we need to do  It can easily be true that X      r T   S   In that  case we are saying that the lowest value is a negative number but that statement is  meaningless   A call can never be worth less than zero because its holder cannot be  forced to exercise it   Thus  we tend to express this relationship as

23,99,which represents the greater of the value of zero or the underlying price minus the  present value of the exercise price  This value becomes the lower limit of the call price  Now consider an analogous result for puts   Suppose we want to profit from a  declining price of the underlying   One way to do this is to sell the underlying short    Suppose we do that and invest cash equal to the present value of X into risk  free bonds  that pay X at time T  At time T given a price of the underlying of ST the short sale  pays off  ST a reflection of the payment of ST to cover the short sale  The bonds pay  X  Hence the total payoff is X   ST  Now compare that result with the purchase of a put expiring at T with exercise  price of X  If the put expires in the  money  ST   X  it is worth X   ST  If it expires  out  of  the  money  ST   X  it is worth zero  Exhibit    illustrates the comparison of  the put with the short sale and bond strategy  We see that for the in  the  money case  the put and short sale and bond strategies match each other  For the out  of  the  money  case however the put performs better because the short sale and bond strategy pays  X   ST  With ST   X this payment amount is negative  With the put dominating the  short sale and bond strategy the put value cannot be less than the value of the short  sale and bond strategy meaning p    X      r T   S   But as with calls  the right  hand  side can be negative and it hardly helps us to say that a put must sell for more than a  negative number  A put can never be worth less than zero because its owner cannot  be forced to exercise it   Thus  the overall result is expressed succinctly as

11,100,Let us look at some basic examples   Assume the exercise price is     the risk  free  rate is    and the expiration is nine months  so T                Consider two cases   Underlying  S        Minimum call price   Max                          Max                   Minimum put price   Max                          Max                   Underlying  S        Minimum call price   Max                          Max                  Minimum put price   Max                          Max                 To recap in this section we have established lower limits for call and put option  values   Formally restating these results in words  The lowest value of a European call is the greater of zero or the value of the  underlying minus the present value of the exercise price  
12,100,The lowest value of a European put is the greater of zero or the present value  of the exercise price minus the value of the underlying 
13,100,EXAMPLE  
14,100,Basic Principles of European Option Pricing
15,100,  Which of the following factors does not affect the value of a European  option  A The volatility of the underlying B Dividends or interest paid by the underlying C The percentage of the investor  s assets invested in the option   Which of the following statements imply that a European call on a stock is  worth more  A Less time to expiration B A higher stock price relative to the exercise price C Larger dividends paid by the stock during the life of the option   Why might a European put be worth less the longer the time to  expiration 
1,101,  
2,101,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,101,A The cost of waiting to receive the exercise price is higher  B The risk of the underlying is lower over a longer period of time  C The longer time to expiration means that the put is more likely to  expire out  of  the  money    The loss in value of an option as it moves closer to expiration is called  what  A Time value decay B Volatility diminution C Time value of money   How does the minimum value of a call or put option differ from its exer  cise value  A The exercise price is adjusted for the time value of money  B The minimum value reflects the volatility of the underlying   C The underlying price is adjusted for the time value of money 
4,101,Solution to   
5,101,C is correct  The investor  s exposure to the option is not relevant to the price one  should pay to buy or ask to sell the option  Volatility and dividends or interest  paid by the underlying are highly relevant to the value of the option 
6,101,Solution to   
7,101,B is correct   The higher the stock price and the lower the exercise price the  more valuable is the call  Less time to expiration and larger dividends reduce  the value of the call 
8,101,Solution to   
9,101,A is correct   Although the longer time benefits the holder of the option it also  has a cost in that exercise of a longer  term put comes much later  Therefore the  receipt of the exercise price is delayed  Longer time to expiration does not lower  the risk of the underlying   The longer time also does not increase the likelihood  of the option expiring out  of  the  money 
10,101,Solution to   
11,101,A is correct   An option has time value that decays as the expiration approaches    There is no such concept as volatility diminution  Time value of money relates  only to the value of money at one point in time versus another 
12,101,Solution to   
13,101,A is correct   The minimum value formula is the greater of zero or the differ  ence between the underlying price and the present value of the exercise price  whereas the exercise value is the maximum of zero and the appropriate difference  between the underlying price and the exercise price  Volatility does not affect  the minimum price  It does not make sense to adjust the underlying price for  the time value of money for the simple reason that it is already adjusted for the  time value of money 
14,101,      Put Call Parity
15,101,One of the first concepts that a trader learns in options is the parity relationship  between puts and calls   Even though the word  parity   means  equivalence  puts and  calls are not equivalent   There is  however a relationship between the call price and  the price of its corresponding put  which we refer to as put call parity

4,102,called a protective put 
5,102,At expiration the value of the asset is ST  The value of the put will be either zero  or X   ST  If the asset increases in value such that ST   X then the overall position is  worth ST  The asset has performed well and the investor will let the put expire  If the  asset value declines to the point at which ST   X the asset is worth ST and the put  is worth X   ST for a total of X  In other words  the investor would exercise the put   selling the asset for X which exceeds the asset s current value of ST  This strategy seems like a reasonable and possibly quite attractive investment    Investor A receives the benefit of unlimited upside potential with the downside per  formance truncated at X  Exhibit    shows the performance of the protective put   The  graph on the left illustrates the underlying asset and the put   The graph on the right  shows their combined effects

3,107,EXAMPLE  
4,107,Put Call Parity
5,107,  Which of the following statements best describes put call parity  A The put price always equals the call price  B The put price equals the call price if the volatility is known  C The put price plus the underlying price equals the call price plus the  present value of the exercise price    From put call parity which of the following transactions is risk  free  A Long asset  long put  short call B Long call long put  short asset C Long asset  long call short bond
6,107,Solution to   
7,107,C is correct   The put and underlying make up a protective put  while the call  and present value of the exercise price make up a fiduciary call  The put price  equals the call price for certain combinations of interest rates  times to expira  tion and option moneyness  but these are special cases   Volatility has no effect  on put call parity 
8,107,Solution to   
9,107,A is correct   The combination of a long asset  long put  and short call is risk free  because its payoffs produce a known cash flow of the value of the exercise price   The other two combinations do not produce risk  free positions   You should  work through the payoffs of these three combinations in the form of Exhibit    
10,107,    Binomial Valuation of Options
11,107,Because the option payoff is determined by the underlying  if we know the outcome  of the underlying  we know the payoff of the option  That means that the price of the  underlying is the only element of uncertainty  Moreover the uncertainty is not so much  the value of the underlying at expiration as it is whether the underlying is above or  below the exercise price  If the underlying is above the exercise price at expiration the  payoff is ST   X for calls and zero for puts   If the underlying is below the exercise price  at expiration the payoff is zero for calls and X   ST for puts   In other words  the payoff  of the option is straightforward and known as soon as we know whether the option  expires in  or out  of  the  money  Note that for forwards  futures  and swaps  there is  no such added complexity  The payoff formula is the same regardless of whether the  underlying is above or below the hurdle  As a result of this characteristic of options  derivation of an option pricing model  requires the specification of a model of a random process that describes movements  in the underlying   Given the entirely different nature of the payoffs above and below  the exercise price it might seem difficult to derive the option price even if we could  model movements in the underlying   Fortunately the process is less difficult than it  first appears   At this level of treatment  we will start with a very simple model that allows only  two possible movements in the underlying one going up and one going down from  where it is now  This model with two possible outcomes is called the binomial model   Start with the underlying at S  and let it go up to S    or down to S      We cannot  arbitrarily set these values at just anything   We will be required to know the values

3,108,of S    and S      That does not mean we know which outcome will occur  It means that  we know only what the possibilities are  In doing so we effectively know the volatility   Assume the probability of the move to S    is q and the probability of the move to S     is     q  We specify the returns implied by these moves as up and down factors  u and  d where

67,108,Because call options and the underlying move together one possibility is that  buying the underlying and selling a call could create a hedge  Indeed it does  but one  unit of each is not the appropriate balance  Let us sell one call and hold h units of the  underlying   The value h is unknown at the moment  but we will be able to determine  its value  The value today of a combination of h units of the underlying and one short  call is V    hS    c  Think of V  as the amount of money invested  Depending on which of the two  paths is taken by the underlying  the value of this portfolio at time   will be

80,109,Equation     shows that the value of the call today is a weighted average of the  next two possible call prices at expiration where the weights    and       are given  by the second formula in Equation     This formula sheds a great deal of light on option pricing   Notice the following     The volatility of the underlying  which is reflected in the difference between S     and S    and affects c    and c     is an important factor in determining the value  of the option     The probabilities of the up and down moves  q and     q do not appear in the  formula        The values   and       are similar to probabilities and are often called synthetic  or pseudo probabilities   They produce a weighted average of the next two possi  ble call values  a type of expected future value     The formula takes the form of an expected future value the numerator dis  counted at the risk  free rate    and S     On the first point  if volatility increases  the difference between S  increases  which widens the range between c    and c     leading to a higher option  value  The upper payoff c     will be larger and the lower payoff c     will still be zero     On the second point the actual probabilities of the up and down moves do not matter   This result is because of our ability to construct a hedge and the rule of arbitrage  On  the third point  the irrelevance of the actual probabilities is replaced by the relevance  of a set of synthetic or pseudo probabilities    and       which are called risk  neutral
81,109,   We introduced them earlier to help make this point  but ultimately they serve no purpose     Although the lower payoff is zero in this example that will not always be the case

3,110,probabilities  On the fourth point  these risk  neutral probabilities are used to find a  synthetic expected value which is then discounted at the risk  free rate  Thus  the  option is valued as though investors are risk neutral  As we discussed extensively  earlier that is not the same as assuming that investors are risk neutral  If the option does not trade at the specified formula  Equation     investors can  engage in arbitrage transactions   If the option is trading too high relative to the formula   investors can sell the call buy h shares of the underlying  and earn a return in excess  of the risk  free rate while funding the transaction by borrowing at the risk  free rate   The combined actions of arbitrageurs will result in downward pressure on the option  price until it converges to the model price  If the option price is too low buying the  call selling short h units of the asset  and investing the proceeds in risk  free bonds  will generate risk  free cash that will earn more than the risk  free rate  The combined  actions of arbitrageurs doing this will pressure the call price to rise until it reaches  the price given by the model  We will omit the details  but the hedge portfolio can also be constructed with  puts     Changing the c s to p s leads to the binomial put option pricing formula

2,113,Reading      Basics of Derivative Pricing and Valuation
3,113,Underlying  S           The minimum European call price was previously calculated as        The exer  cise value of the American call is Max                     so       is still the  minimum price of the American call     The minimum European put price was previously calculated as        The  exercise value of the American put is Max                    So     is the  minimum price of the American put   The call result leads us to a somewhat surprising conclusion  With the exception  of what happens at expiration when American and European calls are effectively the  same and both worth the exercise value an American call is always worth more in  the market than exercised  That means that an American call will never be exercised  early  This result is probably not intuitive  Consider a deep in  the  money call  One might think that if the holder expected  the underlying to not increase any further exercise might be justified  Yet  we said the  call would sell for more in the market than its exercise value  What is the rationale   If the investor thinks the underlying will not go up any further and thus expects no  further gains from the option why would she prefer the underlying  Would the investor  be happier holding the underlying  which she believes is not expected to increase   Moreover she would tie up more funds exercising to acquire the underlying than if  she just held on to the option or better yet  sold it to another investor  So far however we have left out a possible factor that can affect early exercise   Suppose the underlying is a stock and pays dividends   When a stock goes ex  dividend  its price instantaneously falls   Although we will omit the details  an investor holding  a call option may find it worthwhile to exercise the call just before the stock goes  ex  dividend  The capture of the dividend thereby avoiding the ex  dividend drop in  the price of the underlying  can make early exercise worthwhile  If the underlying is  a bond coupon interest can also motivate early exercise  But if there are significant  carrying costs  the motivation for early exercise is weakened  Storage costs lend a  preference for owning the option over owning the underlying   Because the minimum value of an American put exceeds the minimum value of  the European put  there is a much stronger motivation for early exercise  Suppose  you owned an American put on a stock that is completely bankrupt  with a zero stock  price and no possibility of recovery  You can either wait until expiration and capture  its exercise value of Max  X   ST    Max  X        Max  X    X or you can capture  that value by exercising now  Obviously now is better  As it turns out  however the  underlying does not need to go all the way to zero  There is a critical point at which  a put is so deep in  the  money that early exercise is justified  This rationale works  differently for a call  A deep in  the  money put has a limit to its ultimate value  It can  get no deeper than when the underlying goes to zero  For a call there is no limit to  its moneyness because the underlying has no upper limit to its price  Although dividends and coupon interest encourage early exercise for calls  they  discourage early exercise for puts   The loss from the decline in the price of the under  lying that is avoided by exercising a call just before the decline works to the benefit of  a put holder  Therefore if a put holder were considering exercising early he would be  better off waiting until right after the dividend or interest were paid  Carrying costs  on the underlying  which discourage exercise for calls  encourage exercise for puts   At this point  we cannot determine the critical prices at which American options  are best exercised early  We require more knowledge and experience with option  pricing models  which is covered in more advanced material

4,114,American Option Pricing
5,114,  With respect to American calls  which of the following statements is most  accurate  A American calls should be exercised early if the underlying has reached  its expected maximum price  B American calls should be exercised early if the underlying has a lower  expected return than the risk  free rate  C American calls should be exercised early only if there is a dividend or  other cash payment on the underlying     The effect of dividends on a stock on early exercise of a put is to  A make early exercise less likely  B have no effect on early exercise  C make early exercise more likely 
6,114,Solution to   
7,114,C is correct   Cash payments on the underlying are the only reason to exercise  American calls early  Interest rates  the expected return on the underlying  and  any notion of a maximum price is irrelevant   But note that a dividend does not  mean that early exercise should automatically be conducted  A dividend is only  a necessary condition to justify early exercise for calls  
8,114,Solution to   
9,114,A is correct   Dividends drive down the stock price when the dividend is paid   Thus  all else being equal a stock paying dividends has a built  in force that drives  down the stock price  This characteristic discourages early exercise because  stock price declines are beneficial to holders of puts  
10,114,SUMMARY
11,114,This reading on derivative pricing provides a foundation for understanding how  derivatives are valued and traded  Key points include the following     The price of the underlying asset is equal to the expected future price dis  counted at the risk  free rate plus a risk premium plus the present value of any  benefits  minus the present value of any costs associated with holding the asset      An arbitrage opportunity occurs when two identical assets or combinations of  assets sell at different prices  leading to the possibility of buying the cheaper  asset and selling the more expensive asset to produce a risk  free return without  investing any capital     In well  functioning markets  arbitrage opportunities are quickly exploited and  the resulting increased buying of underpriced assets and increased selling of  overpriced assets returns prices to equivalence

3,115,   Derivatives are priced by creating a risk  free combination of the underlying and  a derivative leading to a unique derivative price that eliminates any possibility  of arbitrage     Derivative pricing through arbitrage precludes any need for determining risk  premiums or the risk aversion of the party trading the option and is referred to  as risk  neutral pricing      The value of a forward contract at expiration is the value of the asset minus the  forward price     The value of a forward contract prior to expiration is the value of the asset  minus the present value of the forward price     The forward price established when the contract is initiated is the price agreed  to by the two parties that produces a zero value at the start      Costs incurred and benefits received by holding the underlying affect the for  ward price by raising and lowering it  respectively     Futures prices can differ from forward prices because of the effect of interest  rates on the interim cash flows from the daily settlement      Swaps can be priced as an implicit series of off  market forward contracts   whereby each contract is priced the same resulting in some contracts being  positively valued and some negatively valued but with their combined value  equaling zero     At expiration a European call or put is worth its exercise value which for calls  is the greater of zero or the underlying price minus the exercise price and for  puts is the greater of zero and the exercise price minus the underlying price     European calls and puts are affected by the value of the underlying  the exercise  price the risk  free rate the time to expiration the volatility of the underlying   and any costs incurred or benefits received while holding the underlying      Option values experience time value decay which is the loss in value due to the  passage of time and the approach of expiration plus the moneyness and the  volatility     The minimum value of a European call is the maximum of zero and the under  lying price minus the present value of the exercise price     The minimum value of a European put is the maximum of zero and the present  value of the exercise price minus the price of the underlying      European put and call prices are related through put call parity which specifies  that the put price plus the price of the underlying equals the call price plus the  present value of the exercise price     European put and call prices are related through put call forward parity which  shows that the put price plus the value of a risk  free bond with face value equal  to the forward price equals the call price plus the value of a risk  free bond with  face value equal to the exercise price     The values of European options can be obtained using the binomial model  which specifies two possible prices of the asset one period later and enables the  construction of a risk  free hedge consisting of the option and the underlying      American call prices can differ from European call prices only if there are cash  flows on the underlying  such as dividends or interest   these cash flows are the  only reason for early exercise of a call     American put prices can differ from European put prices  because the right to  exercise early always has value for a put  which is because of a lower limit on  the value of the underlying

4,121,  A is correct   An illiquid position is a limit to arbitrage because it may be diffi  cult to realize gains of an illiquid offsetting position  A significant opportunity  arises from a sufficiently large price differential or a small price differential that  can be employed on a very large scale    A is correct   Some arbitrage opportunities represent such small price discrepan  cies that they are only worth exploiting if the transaction costs are low  An arbi  trage opportunity may require short  selling assets at costs that eliminate any  profit potential  If the law of one price holds  there is no arbitrage opportunity    C is correct   Arbitrage is a type of transaction undertaken when two assets or  portfolios produce identical results but sell for different prices   A trader buys  the asset or portfolio with the lower price and sells the asset or portfolio with  the higher price generating a net inflow of funds at the start of the holding  period  Because the two assets or portfolios produce identical results  a long  position in one and short position in the other means that at the end of the  holding period the payoffs offset   Therefore there is no money gained or lost at  the end of the holding period so there is no risk     B is correct   The forward price is agreed upon at the start of the contract and is  the fixed price at which the underlying will be purchased  or sold  at expiration   Payment is made at expiration  The value of the forward contract may change  over time but the forward price does not change    C is correct   The price of a forward contract is a contractually fixed price  established at initiation at which the underlying will be purchased  or sold  at  expiration  The value of a forward contract at initiation is zero  therefore the  forward price is greater than the value of the forward contract at initiation    B is correct   The value of the forward contract  unlike its price will adjust as  market conditions change  The forward price is fixed at initiation    A is correct   When a forward contract expires  if the spot price is higher than  the forward price the long party profits from paying the lower forward price  for the underlying   Therefore the forward contract has a positive value to the  long party and a negative value to the short party  However if the forward price  is higher than the spot price the short party profits from receiving the higher  forward price  the contract value is positive to the short party and negative to  the long party     B is correct   At initiation the forward price is the future value of the spot price   spot price compounded at the risk  free rate over the life of the contract   If the  forward price were set to the spot price or the present value of the spot price  it would be possible for one side to earn an arbitrage profit by selling the asset  and investing the proceeds until contract expiration    A is correct   The forward price of each stock is found by compounding the spot  price by the risk  free rate for the period and then subtracting the future value of  any benefits and adding the future value of any costs   In the absence of any ben  efits or costs  the one  year forward prices of BWQ and ZER should be equal   After subtracting the benefits related to BWQ the one  year forward price of  BWQ is lower than the one  year forward price of ZER      A is correct   An asset s forward price is increased by the future value of any  costs and decreased by the future value of any benefits   F  T    S      r T                r T  If the net cost of carry  benefits less costs  is positive the forward  price is lower than if the net cost of carry was zero

3,122,   C is correct   When a commodity  s storage costs exceed its convenience yield  benefits  the net cost of carry  benefits less costs  is negative  Subtracting this  negative amount from the spot price compounded at the risk  free rate results in  an addition to the compounded spot price  The result is a commodity forward  price which is higher than the spot price compounded  The commodity  s for  ward price is less than the spot price compounded when the convenience yield  benefits exceed the storage costs and the commodity  s forward price is the same  as the spot price compounded when the costs equal the benefits      C is correct   The convenience yield is a benefit of holding the asset and gener  ally exists when a commodity is in short supply  The future value of the con  venience yield is subtracted from the compounded spot price and reduces the  commodity  s forward price relative to it spot price  The opportunity cost is the  risk  free rate  In the absence of carry costs  the forward price is the spot price  compounded at the risk  free rate and will exceed the spot price  Dividends are  benefits that reduce the forward price but the lack of dividends has no effect on  the spot price relative to the forward price of a commodity in short supply     B is correct   When interest rates are constant  forwards and futures will likely  have the same prices   The price differential will vary with the volatility of  interest rates   In addition if futures prices and interest rates are uncorrelated  forward and futures prices will be the same  If futures prices are positively  correlated with interest rates  futures contracts are more desirable to holders  of long positions than are forwards   This is because rising prices lead to future  profits that are reinvested in periods of rising interest rates  and falling prices  lead to losses that occur in periods of falling interest rates   If futures prices are  negatively correlated with interest rates  futures contracts are less desirable to  holders of long positions than are forwards   The more desirable contract will  tend to have the higher price     C is correct   Futures contracts are marked  to  market on a daily basis   The  accumulated gains and losses from the previous day  s trading session are  deducted from the accounts of those holding losing positions and transferred to  the accounts of those holding winning positions   Futures contracts trade on an  exchange forward contracts are over  the  counter transactions   Typically both  forward and futures contracts are initiated at a zero value     A is correct   If futures prices and interest rates are negatively correlated for  wards are more desirable to holders of long positions than are futures   This is  because rising prices lead to futures profits that are reinvested in periods of fall  ing interest rates   It is better to receive all of the cash at expiration under such  conditions   If futures prices and interest rates are uncorrelated forward and  futures prices will be the same  If futures prices are positively correlated with  interest rates  futures contracts are more desirable to holders of long positions  than are forwards      B is correct   Valuation of the swap during its life appeals to replication and  the principle of arbitrage  Valuation consists of reproducing the remaining  payments on the swap with other transactions   The value of that replication  strategy is the value of the swap  The swap price is typically set such that the  swap contract has a value of zero at initiation  The value of a swap contract will  change during the life of the contract as the value of the underlying changes in  value     C is correct   Replication is the key to pricing a swap  The swap price is deter  mined at initiation by replication  The value  not the price  of the swap is typi  cally zero at initiation and the fixed swap price is typically determined such that  the value of the swap will be zero at initiation

3,123,   B is correct   The principal of replication articulates that the valuation of a swap  is the present value of all the net cash flow payments from the swap not simply  the present value of the fixed payments of the swap or the present value of the  underlying at the end of the contract      B is correct   If the underlying has a value equal to the exercise price at expira  tion both options will have zero value since they both have the same exercise  price  For example if the exercise price is     and at expiration the underlying  price is     both the call option and the put option will have a value of zero   The value of an option cannot fall below zero  The holder of an option is not  obligated to exercise the option  therefore the options each have a minimum  value of zero  If the call has a positive value the put  by definition must have a  zero value and vice versa   Both cannot have a positive value     C is correct   A European put option will be valuable at expiration if the exer  cise price is greater than the underlying price  The holder can put  deliver  the  underlying and receive the exercise price which is higher than the spot price   A European put option would be worthless if the exercise price was equal to or  less than the underlying price     B is correct   The value of a European call option at expiration is the greater of  zero or the value of the underlying minus the exercise price     B is correct   A European call option with two months until expiration will typi  cally have positive time value where time value reflects the value of the uncer  tainty that arises from the volatility in the underlying   The call option has a zero  exercise value if the spot price is below the exercise price  The exercise value  of a European call option is Max  St   X  where St is the current spot price at  time t and X is the exercise price     A is correct   When the price of the underlying is below the exercise price for a  put  the option is said to be in  the  money  If the price of the underlying is the  same as the exercise price the put is at  the  money and if it is above the exercise  price the put is out  of  the  money     A is correct   An in  the  money European put option decreases in value with an  increase in the risk  free rate  A higher risk  free rate reduces the present value of  any proceeds received on exercise     A is correct   The value of a European call option is inversely related to the exer  cise price  A lower exercise price means there are more potential outcomes at  which the call expires in  the  money  The option value will be greater the lower  the exercise price  For a higher exercise price the opposite is true  Both the  time to expiration and the volatility of the underlying are directly  positively   related to the value of a European call option     B is correct   The value of a European call option is inversely related to the exer  cise price and directly related to the time to expiration  Option   and Option    have the same exercise price  however Option   has a longer time to expiration   Consequently Option   would likely have a higher value than Option    Option    and Option   have the same time to expiration  however Option   has a lower  exercise price  Thus  Option   would likely have a higher value than Option       B is correct   The value of a European put option can be either directly or  indirectly related to time to expiration  The direct effect is more common but  the inverse effect can prevail the longer the time to expiration the higher the  risk  free rate and the deeper in  the  money is the put   The value of a European  put option is directly related to the exercise price and the volatility of the  underlying

9,130,INTRODUCTION
10,130,Assets under management in vehicles classified as alternative investments have grown  rapidly since the mid      s   This growth has largely occurred because of interest in  these investments by institutions  such as endowment and pension funds  as well as  high  net  worth individuals seeking diversification and return opportunities   Alternative  investments are perceived to behave differently from traditional investments   Investors  may seek either absolute return or relative return

4,131,Some investors hope alternative investments will provide positive returns through  out the economic cycle  this goal is an absolute return objective  Alternative investments  are not free of risk  however and their returns may be negative and or correlated with  other investments  including traditional investments  especially in periods of finan  cial crisis   Some investors in alternative investments have a relative return objective   A relative return objective which is often the objective of portfolios of traditional  investment seeks to achieve a return relative to an equity or fixed  income benchmark   This reading is organized as follows   Section   describes alternative investments   basic characteristics and categories   general strategies of alternative investment  portfolio managers   the role of alternative investments in a diversified portfolio  and  investment structures used to provide access to alternative investments   Sections    through   describe features of hedge funds  private equity real estate commodities   and infrastructure respectively along with issues in calculating returns to and valuation  of each   Section   briefly describes other alternative investments   Section   provides  an overview of risk management  including due diligence of alternative investments    A summary and practice problems conclude the reading  
5,131,ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
6,131,Alternative investments fall outside of the definition of long  only publicly traded  investments in stocks  bonds  and cash  often referred to as traditional investments    In other words  they are alternatives to long  only positions in stocks  bonds  and  cash  The terms  traditional  and  alternatives  should not be construed to imply  that alternatives are necessarily uncommon and or relatively recent additions to the  investment universe  Alternative investments include investments in assets such as  real estate and commodities  which are arguably two of the oldest investment classes   Alternative investments also include non  traditional approaches to investing within  special vehicles  such as private equity funds  hedge funds  and some exchange  traded  funds  ETFs   These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and  leverage make investments in illiquid assets  and take short positions   The assets in  which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets  stocks  bonds  and cash  as  well as other assets   Management of alternative investments is typically active  Passive  versions of commodities and real estate investments are available but hedge funds   private equity and infrastructure investments are almost always actively managed   Alternative investments  particularly investments through special vehicles  are often  characterized by high fees  concentrated portfolios  high use of leverage and restric  tions on fund redemptions   Several other characteristics are common to many but not all alternative invest  ments   An alternative investment might not be expected to have all the following  characteristics but will typically be expected to have some of them     Illiquidity of underlying investments    Narrow manager specialization    Low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments    Less regulation and less transparency than traditional investments    Limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return data    Unique legal and tax considerations

14,132,Institutions and high  net  worth individuals have been at the forefront of those  investing in alternative investments with the expectation of diversifying their portfo  lios and enhancing their risk return profiles   Their hopes that alternative investments  will behave differently from traditional investments and will provide positive absolute  returns throughout the economic cycle may not be realistic  Alternative investments  are not free of risk  and their returns may be correlated with those of other risky  investments  especially in periods of financial crisis   During a long historical period  the average correlation of returns from alternative investments with those of traditional  investments may be low but in any particular period the correlation can differ from  the average  During periods of economic crisis  such as late      correlations among  risky assets can increase dramatically  Investors must be careful in evaluating the historical record of alternative invest  ments because reported return data can be problematic  Further reported returns and  standard deviations are averages and may not be representative of sub  periods within  the reported period or future periods   Many investments  such as direct real estate and  private equity are often valued using estimated  appraised  values rather than actual  market prices for the subject investments   As a result  the volatility of their returns   as well as the correlation of their returns with the returns of traditional asset classes   will tend to be underestimated  Private equity market returns may be estimated using  the technique proposed by Woodward and Hall        to address data problems with  historical published indexes  which reflect underlying investments held at cost    The  record of alternative investment universes  such as hedge fund indexes  may be subject  to a variety of biases  including survivorship and backfill biases    Thus  the indexes
15,132,  This technique involves statistical estimation of quarterly market returns using published fund index  and securities market index returns     Survivorship bias relates to the inclusion of only  live  investment funds   The returns of funds that have  been liquidated are excluded  Backfill bias results from including previous return data for funds that enter  the index   Both biases may result in returns that are artificially high because survivorship bias most likely  results in the index excluding poorly performing funds and backfill bias most likely results in the index  including high  performing funds   Using fund  of  funds returns  instead of individual funds  as in Exhibit    reduces the influence of these biases

10,135,Considering the variety of characteristics common to many alternative investments  it  is not surprising that no consensus exists on a definitive list of these investments   There  is even considerable debate as to what represents a category versus a sub  category of  alternative investments   For instance some listings define distressed securities as a  separate category whereas others consider distressed securities as a sub  category of  the hedge funds and or private equity categories  or even a subset of high  yield bond  investing   Similarly managed futures are sometimes defined as a separate category  and sometimes as a sub  category of hedge funds and or commodities   The following  list offers one approach to define broad categories of alternative investments   Each  category is described in detail later in this reading      Hedge funds  Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that manage port  folios of securities and derivative positions using a variety of strategies   They  may use long and short positions  may be highly leveraged and aim to deliver  investment performance that is independent of broad market performance     Private equity funds  Private equity funds generally invest in companies   either start  up or established  that are not listed on a public exchange or they  invest in public companies with the intent to take them private  The majority of

4,139,    Portfolio Context  Integration of Alternative Investments  with Traditional Investments
5,139,A key motivation cited for investing in alternative investments is their diversifying  potential  Investors perceive an opportunity to improve the risk return relationship  within the portfolio context   Given the historical return volatility and correlation  profiles of alternative investments  combining a portfolio of alternative investments  with a portfolio of traditional investments potentially improves the overall portfolio s  risk return profile  The correlation between some categories of alternative investments  and traditional investments has historically over long periods  been low or at least less  than perfect  providing diversification opportunities   The historically higher returns  by many categories of alternative investments compared with traditional investments  result in potentially higher returns to a portfolio containing alternative investments   and the less  than  perfect correlation with traditional investments results in portfolio  risk  standard deviation  being less than a weighting of the standard deviations   In  identifying the appropriate allocation to alternative investments  however an invest  ment manager is likely to consider more than mean return and average standard devi  ation of returns   When considering potential portfolio combinations  the manager  s  analysis may include historical downside frequencies and worst return in a month for  potential portfolio combinations   The purported diversification benefits and improved risk return contributions  of alternative investments to portfolios explain why institutional investors such as  pension funds may allocate a portion of their portfolios to alternative investments    There are challenges  however including obtaining reliable measures of risk and  return identifying the appropriate allocation and selecting portfolio managers   It is  important to note that expected diversification benefits from alternative investments  are not always realized including sometimes when they are most needed  Correlations  between risky investments increase during periods of market stress and can approach      during financial crises  
6,139,    Investment Structures
7,139,A common structure for many alternative investments  such as hedge funds and pri  vate equity funds  is a partnership in which the fund manager is the general partner   GP  and investors are limited partners  LPs   Limited partnerships are restricted to  investors who are expected to understand and to be able to assume the risks associated  with the investments   Fund investments  because they are not offered to the general  public may be unregulated or less regulated than offerings to the general public     The GP runs the business and theoretically bears unlimited liability for anything that  might go wrong   Because most individuals are unwilling to bear unlimited liability
8,139,   In the United States  the US Securities Act of      regulates the process by which investment securities  are offered  Most alternative investment funds are structured as  private placements   which are defined  within Regulation D of the Securities Act and sometimes called  Reg D Offerings   
1,140,Hedge Funds

3,140, 
4,140,the GP is usually a limited liability corporation  Limited partners own a fractional  interest in the partnership based on their investment and as agreed to by the partners    An LP s fractional interest is often referred to as his share of the partnership  These  partnerships are frequently located in tax  efficient locations  which benefit both the  GP and the LPs   Funds set up as private investment partnerships typically have a limit  on the number of LPs     Funds are generally structured with a management fee based on assets under  management  sometimes called the base fee  plus an incentive fee  or performance  fee  based on realized profits   Sometimes  the fee structure specifies that the incentive  fee is earned only after the fund achieves a specified return known as a hurdle rate   Fee calculations also take into account high  water marks which reflect the highest  cumulative return used to calculate an incentive fee  It is the highest value net of fees   that the fund has reached  The use of high  water marks protects clients from paying  twice for the same performance  Many alternative investment funds  including hedge  funds  use this basic partnership and fee structure  Fee structures are discussed in  more detail later in the reading  
5,140,HEDGE FUNDS
6,140,In      Alfred Winslow Jones  a sociologist investigating fundamental and technical  research to forecast the stock market for Fortune magazine set up an investment fund  with himself as GP  The fund followed three key tenets       Always maintain short  positions      always use leverage and     charge only an incentive fee of     of profits  with no fixed fees   Jones called his portfolio a  hedged  fund  eventually shortened to   hedge fund   because he had short positions to offset his long positions in the stock  market   Theoretically the overall portfolio was hedged against major market moves   Although Jones  original three tenets still have some relevance to the hedge fund  industry not all hedge funds maintain short positions and or use leverage and most  hedge funds have some non  incentive fees   A contemporary hedge fund may have  the following characteristics      It is an aggressively managed portfolio of investments across asset classes and  regions that is leveraged takes long and short positions  and or uses derivatives      It has a goal of generating high returns  either in an absolute sense or over a  specified market benchmark  and it has few if any investment restrictions      It is set up as a private investment partnership open to a limited number of  investors willing and able to make a large initial investment      It imposes restrictions on redemptions  Investors may be required to keep  their money in the hedge fund for a minimum period  referred to as a lockup  period  before they are allowed to make withdrawals or redeem shares    Investors may be required to give notice of their intent to redeem  the notice  period is typically    to    days in length  Also investors may be charged a fee  to redeem shares  
7,140,   Because of the inherent risk involved in alternative investments  investment is typically restricted to a  specified number of investors meeting certain criteria   The number and criteria can be specified by regu  lation or set by the fund  In the United States  the number depends on whether funds target  Accredited  Investors  or  Qualified Purchasers   as defined by the Investment Company Act of      Sections   c     and   respectively   A fund can have no more than     Accredited Investors  individuals with at least      million and institutions with at least     million in investable assets  or no more than     Qualified  Purchasers  individuals with at least    million and institutions with at least     million in investable assets

3,141,Investors  willingness to invest in hedge funds  despite the restrictions on redemp  tions  is largely because of the reported returns of some hedge funds and their  perceived low correlation with traditional investments   The positive performance of  many funds in the early     s  when other investments had declined supported the  diversification potential of hedge funds in a portfolio  The growth of interest in hedge  funds as investments led to the emergence of funds of hedge funds   Funds of hedge funds are funds that hold a portfolio of hedge funds   They make  hedge funds accessible to smaller investors while allowing those investors to be  diversified to some extent among hedge funds   Also funds of hedge funds  commonly  shortened to  funds of funds   are assumed to have some expertise in conducting due  diligence on hedge funds and may be able to negotiate better redemption terms than  individual investors can  Funds of hedge funds invest in numerous hedge funds and  may diversify across fund strategies  investment regions  and management styles   The  distinction between a single hedge fund and a fund of hedge funds is not necessarily  clear  cut because many hedge funds invest in other hedge funds   Hedge fund managers are less restricted than traditional investment managers  and thus may have the flexibility to invest anywhere they see opportunity  Most  hedge funds do have a broadly stated strategy but are allowed some deviation from  that strategy  Hedge funds are often given the flexibility to invest a percentage of the  AUM generally less than     how and when they see fit   A hedge fund can also be  structured as part of one  asset management  business that is  contracted  to manage  several different funds  e g   SuperStar Asset Management might manage SuperStar  Credit Fund SuperStar Commodities Fund and SuperStar Multi  Strategy Fund   The growing popularity of hedge funds is illustrated by AUM and net asset flows  for the period of      through       Hedge Fund Research Inc   HFRI  reports that  AUM grew from approximately      billion in      to       billion in      and to       trillion in         Exhibit   compares the returns and a variety of risk and performance measures of  the HFRI Fund of Funds Composite Index the MSCI ACWI Index and the Bloomberg  Barclays Global Aggregate Index  The HFRI Fund of Funds Index is an equally weighted  performance index of funds of hedge funds included in the HFR database  Hedge  fund indexes suffer from issues related to self  reporting  but the Fund of Funds index  reflects the actual performance of portfolios of hedge funds   This index may show  a lower reported return because of the added layer of fees    but it may represent  average hedge fund performance more realistically than HFRI s composite index of  individual funds   As shown in Exhibit    over the     year period hedge funds had higher returns  than stocks and bonds and an almost identical standard deviation as bonds   As a result  the Sharpe ratio for hedge funds appeared to dominate these and other investments   see Exhibit    in both return and risk   Note that the returns and volatilities  standard  deviations  represent an average and are not representative of any single year  Hedge  funds do not appear as attractive as bonds if returns are adjusted for downside devia  tion as reflected in the Sortino measures in Exhibit    The  worst drawdown  reflecting  the period of largest cumulative negative returns for hedge funds and global equities  was during the period that began in       when each peaked  and ended in

13,142,    Hedge Fund Strategies
14,142,Hedge funds are typically classified by strategy although categorizations vary  Many  classifying organizations focus on the most common strategies  but others have clas  sification systems based on different criteria such as the underlying assets in which  the funds are invested  Also classifications change over time as new strategies  often  based on new products and opportunities in the market  are introduced  Classifying  hedge funds is important so that investors can review aggregate performance data   select strategies to build a portfolio of funds  and select or construct appropriate  performance benchmarks   In      HFRI identified four broad categories of strat  egies   event  driven relative value macro and equity hedge    Exhibit    shows the  approximate percentage of hedge fund AUM by strategy according to HFRI for            and       Based on percentage of hedge fund AUM by strategy event  driven  and relative value strategies have grown in popularity during the last    years  while  macro and equity hedge funds have declined

1,143,   
2,143,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,143,      Event  Driven Strategies
4,143,Event  driven strategies seek to profit from short  term events  typically involving  potential changes in corporate structure such as an acquisition or restructuring  that  are expected to affect individual companies   This strategy is considered  bottom up    company  level analysis followed by aggregation and analysis of a larger group such  as an industry  as opposed to  top down   global macro analysis followed by sectoral  regional analysis followed by company analysis   Investments may include long and  short positions in common and preferred stocks  as well as debt securities and options    Further subdivisions of this category by HFRI include the following     Merger arbitrage  Generally these strategies involve going long  buying  the  stock of the company being acquired and going short  selling  the stock of the  acquiring company when the merger or acquisition is announced  The manager  may expect to profit from the deal spread which reflects the uncertainty of the  deal closing  or may expect the acquirer to ultimately overpay for the acquisi  tion and perhaps suffer from an increased debt load  The primary risk in this  strategy is that the announced merger or acquisition does not occur and the  hedge fund has not closed its positions on a timely basis      Distressed restructuring   These strategies focus on the securities of compa  nies either in bankruptcy or perceived to be near to bankruptcy  Hedge funds  attempt to profit from distressed securities in a variety of ways   The hedge fund  may simply purchase fixed  income securities trading at a significant discount  to par  This transaction takes place in anticipation of the company restructuring  and the fund earning a profit from the subsequent sale of the securities   The  hedge fund may also use a more complicated approach for example buying  senior debt and shorting junior debt or buying preferred stock and shorting  common stock   These transactions take place in expectation of a profit as the  spread between the securities widens   The fund may also short sell the compa  ny  s stock  but this transaction involves considerable risk given the potential for  loss if the company  s prospects improve     Activist  The term  activist  is short for  activist shareholder   These strategies  focus on the purchase of sufficient equity in order to influence a company  s  policies or direction  For example the activist hedge fund may advocate for  divestitures  restructuring  capital distributions to shareholders  and or changes  in management and company strategy  These hedge funds are distinct from  private equity because they operate in the public equity market      Special situations  These strategies focus on opportunities in the equity of  companies that are currently engaged in restructuring activities other than  mergers  acquisitions  or bankruptcy  These activities include security issuance  or repurchase special capital distributions  and asset sales spin  offs  
5,143,      Relative Value Strategies
6,143,Relative value funds seek to profit from a pricing discrepancy  an unusual short  term  relationship  between related securities   The expectation is that the pricing discrepancy  will be resolved in time  This strategy typically involves buying and selling related  securities   Examples of relative value strategies include the following     Fixed  income convertible arbitrage  These market  neutral  a zero  beta  portfolio at least in theory  investment strategies seek to exploit a perceived  mispricing between a convertible bond and its component parts  the underlying  bond and the embedded stock option   The strategy typically involves buying  convertible debt securities and simultaneously selling the same issuer  s common  stock  
1,144,Hedge Funds
2,144,   
3,144,   Fixed  income asset backed  These strategies focus on the relative value  between a variety of asset  backed securities  ABS  and mortgage  backed securi  ties  MBS  and seek to take advantage of mispricing across different ABS     Fixed  income general  These strategies focus on the relative value within the  fixed  income markets   Strategies may incorporate trades between two corporate  issuers  between corporate and government issuers  between different parts of  the same issuer  s capital structure or between different parts of an issuer  s yield  curve  Currency dynamics and government yield curve considerations may also  come into play when managing these fixed  income instruments      Volatility  These strategies typically use options to go long or short market vol  atility either in a specific asset class or across asset classes   Option prices reflect  implied volatility and an increase in market volatility leads to an increase in  option prices      Multi  strategy  These strategies trade relative value within and across asset  classes or instruments   Rather than focusing on one type of trade  e g   convert  ible arbitrage  a single basis for trade  e g   volatility  or a particular asset class   e g   fixed income  this strategy instead looks for investment opportunities  wherever they might exist  
4,144,      Macro Strategies
5,144,Macro hedge funds emphasize a top  down approach to identify economic trends  evolving across the world  Trades are made based on expected movements in eco  nomic variables   Generally these funds trade opportunistically in the fixed  income  equity currency and commodity markets   Macro hedge funds use long and or short  positions to potentially profit from a view on overall market direction as influenced  by major economic trends and or events  
6,144,      Equity Hedge Strategies
7,144,Equity hedge strategies can be thought of as the original hedge fund category  They  are focused on public equity markets and take long and short positions in equity  and equity derivative securities   Some hedge funds  called equity  only funds  invest  exclusively in common equity securities   Equity hedge strategies are not focused on  equity trades categorized as consistent with event  driven or macro strategies   Equity  hedge strategies use a bottom  up as opposed to top  down approach  Other investors   not structured as hedge funds  may use some similar strategies   Examples of equity  hedge strategies include the following     Market neutral  These strategies use quantitative  technical  and or funda  mental analysis to identify under  and over  valued equity securities   The hedge  fund takes long positions in securities it has identified as undervalued and short  positions in securities it has identified as overvalued  The hedge fund tries to  maintain a net position that is neutral with respect to market risk   Ideally the  portfolio should have a beta of approximately zero  The intent is to profit from  individual securities movements while hedging against market risk      Fundamental growth  These strategies use fundamental analysis to identify  companies expected to exhibit high growth and capital appreciation  The hedge  fund takes long positions in identified companies      Fundamental value  These strategies use fundamental analysis to identify com  panies that are undervalued  The hedge fund takes long positions in identified  companies  
1,145,   
2,145,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,145,   Quantitative directional  These strategies use technical analysis to iden  tify companies that are under  and overvalued and to ascertain relationships  between securities   The hedge fund takes long positions in securities identified  as undervalued and short positions in securities identified as overvalued  The  hedge fund typically varies levels of net long or short exposure depending on  the anticipated market direction and stage in the market cycle  Similar long  short approaches exist that are based on fundamental analysis      Short bias  These strategies use quantitative  technical  and or fundamental  analysis to identify overvalued equity securities   The hedge fund takes short  positions in securities identified as overvalued  The fund typically varies its net  short exposure based on market expectations  going fully short in declining  markets      Sector specific  These strategies exploit expertise in a particular sector and use  quantitative  technical  and fundamental analysis to identify opportunities in  the sector  Many hedge funds start as a focused operation specializing in one strategy or asset  class and if successful may diversify over time to become multi  strategy funds   Large  multi  strategy funds are an alternative to funds of hedge funds   Although funds of  hedge funds may offer advantages  for example access by smaller investors  diversified  hedge fund portfolio better redemption terms  and or due diligence expertise  that  multi  strategy funds lack  a primary difference between a multi  strategy hedge fund  and a fund of hedge funds is the extra layer of fees associated with a fund of funds    Each hedge fund in which a fund of hedge funds invests is structured to receive a  management fee plus an incentive fee and the fund of hedge funds itself is also struc  tured to receive a management fee and may receive an incentive fee 
4,145,    Hedge Funds and Diversification Benefits
5,145,Given the broad range of strategies across hedge funds  general statements about hedge  fund performance are not necessarily meaningful  Further there is a general lack of  performance persistence  hedge fund strategies that generate the highest returns in  some years can be the ones to perform the most poorly in subsequent years   The general premise of hedge funds is that they can make money  in other words   earn absolute returns  regardless of the stock market s direction  Their flexibility and the  fact that they typically are not restricted to long  only positions gives them the oppor  tunity to respond to market fluctuations   In addition hedge funds have traditionally  been thought of as  arbitrage  players  meaning that they seek to earn returns while  hedging against risks   Of course in efficient markets  it is hard to find true arbitrage  opportunities   In fact  one of the benefits some hedge funds provide to the financial  marketplace is that they help make markets more efficient by providing liquidity with  contrarian views and speeding up price responses to new information  As the hedge  fund market has grown many traditional hedge fund strategies have become increas  ingly crowded forcing funds to take on more risk to generate competitive returns   Less  than  perfect correlation with the stock market may provide diversification  benefits   The claim is sometimes made by hedge funds that their performance is  uncorrelated not just less than perfectly correlated with stock market performance  but overall this claim is unsubstantiated  Looking at Exhibit    the claims of lack of  correlation with the stock market appear to be supported from      through      but  not in      or from      through       During financial crisis periods  the correlation  between hedge fund and stock market performances may increase

16,146,    Hedge Fund Fees and Other Considerations
17,146,Hedge fund assets under management grew to       trillion by the end of      but  remain a small percentage of the asset management business overall  Hedge funds   however earn a significantly higher percentage of fees   For example according to one  estimate for      hedge funds managed less than    of total managed funds  hedge  funds plus mutual funds  but earned more than     of managed fund revenue  fees      Fund revenue depends on fee structure and fund performance 
18,146,      Fees and Returns
19,146,It is important to consider a hedge fund s fee structure prior to making an investment    This fee structure accounts for the disproportionately high revenues earned relative  to mutual funds and affects the returns to investors   A common fee structure in the  hedge fund market was once    and     which reflects a    management fee and a      incentive fee  both fees are paid by LP investors   The average industry fee is now  closer to a      management fee and        incentive fee    Additionally funds of  hedge funds may charge investors a    management fee and a     incentive fee   The incentive fee may be calculated on profits net of management fees or on profits  before management fees  in other words  the incentive fee is calculated independent  of management fees   Sometimes  the fee structure specifies that the incentive fee is earned only after the  fund achieves a specified return known as a hurdle rate  The hurdle rate is frequently  set based on a risk  free rate proxy  e g   Libor or a specified Treasury bill rate  plus a  premium but may be set as an absolute nominal or real return target   The incentive  fee can be based on returns in excess of the hurdle rate  hard hurdle rate  or on the  entire return  soft hurdle rate  
20,146,   Estimate prepared by Citigroup Inc  and reported by Bloomberg     January           Fees on new funds have declined through the years   HFRI reported in March      that management  fees for new funds averaged      and incentive fees averaged        in       In      it reported that new  fund incentive fees averaged       
1,147,   
2,147,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,147,The fee structure may specify that before an incentive fee is paid following a  year in which the fund s value has declined the fund s value must return to a pre  vious high  water mark   Note that the high  water mark is typically the highest value  reported by the fund  the amount reported is net of fees   High  water marks reflect  the highest cumulative return used to calculate an incentive fee  In other words  the  hedge fund must recover its past losses and return to its high  water mark before any  additional incentive fee is earned  Clients are not charged an incentive fee if the latest  cumulative return does not exceed the prior high  water mark   This use of a high  water  mark protects clients from paying twice for the same performance  Although poorly  performing hedge funds may not receive an incentive fee the management fee is  earned irrespective of returns   Although    and     and    and     represent commonly quoted fee structures  for hedge funds and funds of hedge funds  respectively many fee structure variations  exist in the marketplace  Hedge funds charge different rates  and different classes of  investors may have different fee structures within the same fund  Hedge funds may  be willing to negotiate terms  including fees and notice and lockup periods  with  potential investors   A fee structure may differ from   and    based on the promised  length of the investment   In other words  the longer investors agree to keep their  money in the hedge fund the lower the fees   A fee structure may also vary from    and    based on supply and demand as well as historical performance  Sometimes   rebates or reductions in fees are given to investors or to the placement agent who  introduced another investor to the hedge fund  The following example demonstrates fee structures and their effect on the resulting  returns to investors

9,150,The hedge fund business is attractive to portfolio managers because fees can  generate significant revenue if the fund performs well and AUM are large  Many new  hedge funds launched throughout the late     s and early     s   Not all hedge funds  remain in business long  however  One study suggests that more than a quarter of  all hedge funds fail within the first three years because of performance problems      This outcome is one of the reasons survivorship bias is such a problem in hedge fund  indexes   Because of the survivorship and backfill biases  hedge fund indexes may not  reflect actual average hedge fund performance but rather reflect only the performance  of hedge funds that are performing well

11,150,Hedge funds may use leverage to seek higher returns on their investments   Leverage  has the effect of magnifying gains or losses because the hedge fund can take a large  position relative to the capital committed  Hedge funds may leverage their portfolios  by borrowing capital and or using derivatives   For example if a hedge fund expects the price of Nestl  SA to increase it can take  a number of actions to benefit from the expected price increase  The fund can buy a  thousand shares of Nestl  buy    futures contracts on Nestl  on the NYSE Euronext   buy calls on      shares of Nestl  or sell puts on a thousand shares of Nestl  to profit  from the expected price increase  The profit or loss from holding the futures will be  similar to the profit or loss from holding the shares  but the capital requirement for  the investment in the futures is far lower  If the hedge fund had bought calls on       shares of Nestl  the fund would have paid a relatively small premium and potentially  experienced a significant profit if Nestl  had increased in price  The maximum loss  to the fund would have been the premium paid  If the hedge fund had sold puts on       shares of Nestl  expecting the price to rise and the puts to not be exercised the  fund would have a maximum profit equal to the relatively small premium received   If Nestl  had declined in price however the potential loss would be extremely large  Investors  including hedge funds  are required to put up some collateral when using  derivatives if they are going to be exposed to potential losses on their positions   This  collateral requirement helps to protect against default on the position and helps to  protect the counterparty  or clearinghouse  on the derivative  The amount of collateral

3,151,depends on the investment s riskiness as well as the creditworthiness of the hedge  fund or other investor  Collateral is not invested in a fund s strategy and may be a  drag on performance  The borrowing of capital also leverages a portfolio  It often takes the form of buying  on margin  By borrowing  a hedge fund can invest a larger amount than was invested  in the fund  Hedge funds normally trade through prime brokers which provide  services including custody administration lending  short borrowing  and trading   A  hedge fund will normally negotiate its margin requirements with its prime broker s    The prime broker effectively lends the hedge fund money to make investments  and  the hedge fund puts money or other collateral into a margin account with the prime  broker  The margin account represents the hedge fund s equity in the position  The  margin requirement depends on the investment s riskiness and the creditworthiness  of the hedge fund  The smaller the margin requirement  the more leverage is available to the hedge  fund  Leverage is a large part of the reason that hedge funds make either larger  than   normal returns or significant losses   the leverage magnifies both gains and losses   If  the margin account or the hedge fund s equity in a position declines below a certain  level the lender initiates a margin call and requests the hedge fund put up more  collateral  Margin calls can have the effect of magnifying losses because in order to  meet a margin call the hedge fund may liquidate  close  the losing position  This  liquidation can lead to further losses if the order size is sufficiently large to move the  security  s market price  Another factor that can magnify losses for hedge funds is investor redemptions    Redemptions frequently occur when a hedge fund is performing poorly  In the  hedge fund industry a drawdown is a reduction in net asset value  NAV      When  drawdowns occur investors may decide to exit the fund or redeem at least a portion  of their shares   Redemptions may require the hedge fund manager to liquidate some  positions and incur transaction costs   As already stated the liquidation of a position  may further magnify the losses on the position  Redemption fees may serve to dis  courage redemption and to help the hedge fund managers recover transaction costs    Notice periods may allow the hedge fund manager to liquidate a position in an orderly  fashion without magnifying the losses   Lockup periods give the hedge fund manager  time to implement and potentially realize a strategy  s expected results   If the hedge  fund experiences a drawdown shortly after the fund launch the lockup period will  force investors to stay in the fund rather than withdraw  A hedge fund s ability to  demand a long lockup period and still raise a significant amount of money depends  a great deal on the reputation of either the firm or the hedge fund manager  Funds of  hedge funds may offer more redemption flexibility than afforded by direct investment  in hedge funds because of special redemption arrangements with the underlying  hedge fund managers  maintenance of a cash fund or access to temporary financing   Although hedge funds are not subject to extensive regulation globally there have  been calls for more oversight   In the United States  hedge funds larger than      mil  lion are registered with the SEC  Securities and Exchange Commission   Additional  regulation has been established in recent years   Under the Alternative Investment  Fund Managers Directive  AIFMD  hedge funds that operate or market themselves  in the European Union must be authorized  The AIFMD was implemented in the  European Union  EU  in      and in the United States  regular submission of the  risk disclosure form  Form PF  to the Financial Stability Oversight Council has been  required since       Regulation may not require hedge funds to be transparent to  outsiders or proactive in communicating their strategies and reporting their returns

3,152,Offshore jurisdictions  for example the Cayman Islands  are often the locale for  registering hedge funds  whether managed in the United States  Europe or Asia    Some hedge funds choose to register domestically however  The choice to register  in for example the United States or the United Kingdom may result from the added  credibility of registering with the SEC or the Financial Services Authority respectively   Sometimes  onshore hedge funds set up complementary offshore funds to attract  additional capital 
4,152,EXAMPLE  
5,152,Effect of Redemption
6,152,A European credit hedge fund has a very short notice period of a week because  the fund s managers believe that it invests in highly liquid asset classes and is  market neutral  The fund has a small number of holdings that represent a signif  icant portion of the outstanding issue of each holding   The fund s lockup period  has expired  Unfortunately in one particular month because of the downgrades  of two large holdings  the hedge fund has a drawdown  decline in NAV   of more  than     The declines in value of the two holdings result in margin calls from  their prime broker and the drawdown results in requests to redeem     of total  partnership interests   The combined requests are most likely to  A  force the hedge fund to liquidate or unwind     of its positions in an  orderly fashion throughout the week   B have little effect on the prices received when liquidating the positions  because it has a week before the partnership interests are redeemed  result in a forced liquidation which will further drive down prices and  result in a bigger drawdown so that the remaining investors will redeem  their partnership interests leading to fund liquidation and closure 
7,152,C
8,152,Solution 
9,152,C is correct  One week may not be enough time to unwind the fund s positions in  an orderly fashion so that the unwinding does not further drive down prices   A  downgrading is not likely to have a temporary effect  so even if other non  losing  positions are liquidated to meet the redemption requests  it is unlikely that the  two large holdings will return to previous or higher values   Also the hedge fund  may have a week to satisfy the requests for redemptions  but the margin call  must be met immediately  Thus  it is most likely that a forced liquidation will  drive down prices  resulting in further drawdowns and redemption requests so  that ultimately the fund will liquidate and cease to exist  
10,152,    Hedge Fund Valuation Issues
11,152,Valuations are important for calculating performance and meeting redemptions   The  frequency with which and how hedge funds are valued varies among funds   Hedge  funds are generally valued on a daily weekly monthly and or quarterly basis   The  valuation may use market or estimated values of underlying positions   When market  prices or quotes are used for valuation funds may differ in which price or quote they  use  for example bid price ask price average quote or median quote   A common  practice is to use the average quote   Bid   Ask      A more conservative and theoret  ically accurate approach is to use bid prices for longs and ask prices for shorts   these  are the prices at which the positions could be closed 
1,153,   
2,153,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,153,The underlying positions may be in highly illiquid or non  traded investments   and therefore it is necessary to estimate values because there are no reliable mar  ket values   Estimated values may be computed using statistical models   Any model  should be independently tested benchmarked and calibrated to industry  accepted  standards to ensure a consistency of approach  Because of the potential for conflicts  of interests affecting estimates of value hedge funds should develop procedures for  in  house valuations  communicate these procedures to clients  and adhere to them  Liquidity is an important issue for valuation but becomes particularly so for strat  egies involving convertible bonds  collateralized debt obligations  distressed debt  and  emerging market fixed  income securities  which may be relatively illiquid  If a quoted  market price is available the use of liquidity discounts or  haircuts  is actually incon  sistent with valuation guidance under most generally accepted accounting standards    Many practitioners  however believe that liquidity discounts are necessary to reflect  fair value  This assumption has resulted in some funds having two NAVs trading  and reporting   The trading NAV incorporates liquidity discounts  based on the size of  the position held relative to the total amount outstanding in the issue and its trading  volume  The reporting NAV is based on quoted market prices  
4,153,EXAMPLE  
5,153,Hedge Fund Valuation
6,153,A hedge fund with a market  neutral strategy restricts its investment universe to  domestic publicly traded equity securities that are actively traded  In calculating  net asset value the fund is most likely to use which of the following to value  underlying positions  A Average quotes B Average quotes adjusted for liquidity C Bid price for shorts and ask price for longs
7,153,Solution 
8,153,A is correct   The fund is most likely to use average quotes   The securities are  actively traded so no liquidity adjustment is required  If the fund uses bid ask  prices  it will use ask prices for shorts and bid prices for longs   these are the  prices at which the positions are closed 
9,153,    Due Diligence for Investing in Hedge Funds
10,153,When investing in hedge funds  investors must consider many issues   A basic question  is whether one wants to rely on the expertise of a manager of a fund of hedge funds  to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds or whether one has the expertise to undertake  the hedge fund investment selection process   Funds of hedge funds potentially offer  the benefits of providing a diversified portfolio of hedge funds  supplying expertise in  conducting due diligence and negotiating favorable redemption terms   These potential  benefits come at the cost of an additional layer of fees   Also although a fund of hedge  funds may provide expertise in due diligence the investor should still conduct due  diligence when choosing a fund of hedge funds   Investors in hedge funds should consider many factors in their decision  making  process   This section highlights some of the key due diligence points to consider but  does not provide an exhaustive list of factors   Key factors to consider include investment
1,154,Hedge Funds
2,154,   
3,154,strategy investment process  competitive advantage track record size and longevity  management style key person risk  reputation investor relations  plans for growth  and risk management systems   Investment strategy and process are challenging to fully assess because hedge funds  may limit disclosure in order to maintain their competitive advantage and to not give  away information that is considered proprietary  It should be possible however to  identify in which markets the hedge fund invests  the general investment strategy  for  example long short relative arbitrage and so on  and the basic process to implement  this strategy and the benchmark against which the fund gauges its performance  Track record is a commonly viewed consideration because it should be readily  available and is often assumed to be an indicator of future performance and risk   perhaps incorrectly based on studies of performance persistence     Investors should  determine how the returns are calculated  e g   based on estimates of value or market  prices  and reported  e g   before or after fees  and how the returns and risks compare  with some benchmark   The investor should inquire about the fee structure because  this information will affect  as demonstrated earlier the return to the investor  Size and longevity are also common items for review    The older a fund the more  likely it has not caused significant losses to its investors  otherwise it is likely to have  experienced redemptions  been unable to raise further capital and been liquidated    As a result  older funds are likely to have experienced growth in AUM through both  capital appreciation and additional investments  capital injections   Many investors  require hedge funds to have a minimum track record of two years before they will  invest   This requirement makes it particularly difficult for start  up funds to raise  money because their managers need capital to invest before they can build a track  record  In many cases  start  up funds receive money from seed investors who want a  share of the business for their investment   A hedge fund s size is an important consideration for investors because many  investors set a minimum size on their investments and restrict the percentage of a  fund s overall AUM that their investment can represent   For example if an investor  s  minimum investment size is     million and the investor  s maximum percentage of a  fund is     the minimum hedge fund size the investor can consider is      million         million       The hedge fund due diligence process also focuses on many qualitative factors   including management style key person risk  reputation investor relations  and plans  for growth  A thorough due diligence process will also include a review of management  procedures  including leverage brokerage and diversification policies   The use of  leverage and counterparty risk can significantly affect a fund s risk and performance  In  addition to gathering information about the fund s prime broker and custody arrange   ments for securities  the investor should identify the auditor of the hedge fund and  ensure that the auditor is independent and known for conducting competent audits   Risk management of systems is an important consideration for reviewing a hedge  fund  Relevant risk management questions to ask are varied and related to the type of  securities in which the fund invests   Ultimately the answers should provide comfort  to investors that the fund performs risk management in a rigorous fashion  In many  cases  particularly with smaller funds or those that invest in more unusual or illiquid  assets  the answers to these questions may indicate either that the systems and processes  are simplistic or that the answers themselves are very complex   Commonly hedge  fund managers believe that their strategies  systems  and processes are proprietary

15,155,B is correct   It is important to know how returns are calculated and if they are  comparable before making any decision  If the returns are both reported net of  fees  the higher fees on HF B may account for most of the difference in returns  
16,155,PRIVATE EQUITY
17,155,Private equity generally means investing in privately owned companies or in public  companies with the intent to take them private  There are different stages and types  of private equity investing   The focus of private equity firms  which may manage  many private equity funds  may change through time as business conditions and the  availability of financing change  A possible categorization of private equity identifies  leveraged buyouts  venture capital development capital and distressed investing as  primary private equity strategies   Leveraged buyouts  LBOs  or highly leveraged transactions refer to private  equity firms establishing buyout funds  or LBO funds  that acquire public companies  or established private companies with a significant percentage of the purchase price  financed through debt   The target company  s assets typically serve as collateral for the  debt  and the target company  s cash flows are expected to be sufficient to service the  debt   The debt becomes part of the target company  s capital structure if the buyout  goes through  After the buyout  the target company becomes or remains a privately  owned company  Venture capital entails investing in or providing financing to private companies  with high growth potential  Typically these are start  up or young companies  but  venture capital can be provided at a variety of stages   In contrast  development

20,156,    Private Equity Structure and Fees
21,156,Like hedge funds  private equity funds are typically structured as partnerships in which  outside investors are Limited Partners  LPs  and the private equity firm which may  manage a number of funds  is the General Partner  GP   Most private equity firms  charge both a management fee and an incentive fee on a fund basis   The management  fees generally range from    to    of committed capital  Committed capital is the  amount that the LPs have agreed to provide to the private equity fund  Private equity  funds raise committed capital and draw down on those commitments over three to  five years when they have a specific investment to make  Until the committed capital  is fully drawn down and invested the management fee is based on committed capital  not invested capital  The committed capital basis for management fees is an important  distinction from hedge funds  whose management fees are based on AUM  After the
1,157,   
2,157,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,157,committed capital is fully invested the fees are paid only on the funds remaining in  the investment vehicle  as investments are exited capital is paid back to the investors   and investors no longer pay fees on that portion of their investment   For most private equity funds  the GP does not earn an incentive fee until the  LPs have received back their initial investment   The GP typically receives     of the  total profit  net of any hard hurdle rate of the private equity fund as an incentive or  profit sharing fee    The LPs receive     of the total profit of the equity fund plus the  return of their initial investment   If distributions are made based on profits earned  over time rather than at exit from investments of the fund the distributions may  result in receipts by the GP of more than     of the total profit   Most private equity  partnership agreements include policies that protect the LPs from this contingency   These policies include prohibiting distributions of incentive fees to the GP until the  LPs have received back their invested capital setting up an escrow account for a  portion of the incentive fees  and incorporating a clawback provision that requires  the GP to return any funds distributed as incentive fees until the LPs have received  back their initial investment and     of the total profit   In addition to both management and incentive  profit  sharing  fees  LBO firms  may generate income from sources other than the fund s management fees and profit  sharing   These income sources include a fee paid to the firm for arranging the buyout  of a company compensation if an intended acquisition falls through and a fee for  arranging for divestitures of assets after the buyout is complete  Private equity firms  may also charge consulting fees directly to underlying companies  
4,157,    Private Equity Strategies
5,157,There are many private equity strategies   A common categorization as indicated  earlier identifies leveraged buyouts  venture capital development capital and dis  tressed investing as the primary strategies   LBOs and venture capital are the dominant  strategies  however 
6,157,      Leveraged Buyouts
7,157,LBOs are sometimes referred to as  going private  transactions because after the acqui  sition of a publicly traded company the target company  s equity is generally no longer  publicly traded  When the target company is an established private company it is not  a  going private  transaction  The LBO may also be of a specific type  In management  buyouts  MBOs  the current management team is involved in the acquisition and in  management buy  ins  MBIs  the current management team is being replaced and  the acquiring team will be involved in managing the company  LBO managers seek to  add value from improving company operations and growing revenue and ultimately  increasing profits and cash flows   The sources of growth in earnings before interest   taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  in order of contribution to growth  include organic revenue growth cost reduction restructuring  acquisition and other  according to the Private Equity Growth Capital Council  The potential returns in this  category however result to a large extent from the use of leverage  If debt financing  is unavailable or costly LBOs are less likely to occur          LBO Financing Debt is central to the structure and feasibility of buyouts in  private equity  Target companies are rarely purchased using only the equity of the buyout  company  To potentially increase equity returns and increase the number of transac  tions a particular fund can make private equity firms use debt to finance a significant  proportion of each deal  in other words  they use leverage   For example in a buyout
8,157,   The incentive fee may also be calculated on a deal  by  deal basis

3,158,deal a private equity firm may invest equity representing     of the purchase price  and raise the rest of the purchase price in the debt markets   It may use a combination  of bank loans  often called leveraged loans because of the amount of the company  s  capital structure they represent and high  yield bonds   To protect investors  leveraged loans often carry covenants that may require or  restrict certain actions   For instance the covenants may require the company to main  tain specified financial ratios within certain limits  submit information so that the bank  can monitor performance or operate within certain parameters   The covenants may  restrict the company from further borrowing  in other words  no additional bonds can  be issued and no additional funds can be borrowed from banks or other sources  or  they may impose limits on paying dividends or making operating decisions   Similarly  bond terms may include covenants intended to protect the bondholders   One of the  key differences between leveraged loans and high  yield bonds  however is that lever  aged loans are generally senior secured debt whereas the bonds are unsecured in the  case of bankruptcy  Even given covenants on the bonds  the bonds issued to finance  an LBO are usually high  yield bonds that receive low quality ratings and must offer  high coupons to attract investors because of the amount of leverage used  A typical LBO capital structure includes equity bank debt  leveraged loans   and high  yield bonds   Leveraged loans often provide a larger amount of capital than  either equity or high  yield bonds   As an alternative to high  yield bonds  mezzanine  financing may also be used    Mezzanine financing refers to debt or preferred shares  with a relationship to common equity resulting from a feature such as attached war  rants or conversion options   Being subordinate to both senior and high yield debt   mezzanine financing typically pays a higher coupon rate  In addition to interest or  dividends  this type of financing offers a potential return based on increases in the  value of common equity  The variety of available financing choices provides flexibility for a target company  to match its repayment schedules with expected inflows  and it also permits higher  levels of leverage compared with traditional bank debt   The optimal capital structure  takes into account a variety of factors  including the company  s projected cash flows   investor willingness to purchase different types of debt and accept different levels  of leverage the availability of equity and the required rates of return for equity and  different types of debt considering leverage  The optimal capital structure will be  different for every deal

4,159,      Venture Capital
5,159,Venture capital  VC  is often categorized by the stage at which the company of inter  est  the portfolio company  receives it   The company in which a private equity firm  is investing is often called the portfolio company because it will become part of the  fund s portfolio  The VC stages range from inception of an idea for a company to  the point when the company is about to make an IPO  initial public offering  or be  acquired most typically by a strategic buyer  The investment return required varies  based on the company  s stage of development   Investors in early  stage companies  will demand higher expected returns relative to later  stage investors  because the  earlier the stage of development  the higher the risk   The ultimate returns realized  depend on the portfolio company  s success in transitioning from a startup to a going  and growing concern  Venture capitalists  like all private equity managers  are not passive investors   They  are actively involved with the companies in which they invest   The VC fund typically  receives an equity interest in the company in which it is investing   The VC fund may  also provide some debt financing     Formative  stage financing occurs when the company is still in the process of  being formed and encompasses several financing steps  described as follows   a Angel investing is capital provided at the idea stage  Funds may be used to  transform the idea into a business plan and to assess market potential  The  amount of financing at this stage is typically small and provided by individu  als  often friends and family  rather than by VC funds   b Seed  stage financing or seed capital generally supports product develop  ment and or marketing efforts  including market research  This point is  generally the first stage at which VC funds invest   c Early  stage financing  early  stage VC  is provided to companies mov  ing toward operation but before commercial production and sales have  occurred  Early  stage financing may be provided to initiate commercial  production and sales

5,160,There are several other specialties for private equity firms   These specialties include  development capital also called minority equity investing  which earns profits from  funding business growth or restructuring   Many times  minority equity investing is  initiated and sought by management  which is interested in realizing earnings from  selling a portion of its shares before the company can go public  Although this scenario  occurs most commonly with private companies  publicly quoted companies some  times seek private equity capital in opportunities called PIPEs  private investment in  public equities   Distressed investing by a private equity firm typically involves purchasing the  debt of troubled companies  companies that are bankrupt  in default  or likely to  default   The distressed debt often trades at prices significantly less than its face value   If the company can be turned around the debt may recover its value  The return on  investment is a function of the ability of the turnaround investor to restructure the  company either operationally or financially  Distressed debt investors may be involved  in the turnaround and may assume an active role in the company  s management and  direction or in its reorganization  Some distressed investors are passive investors who  simply try to identify companies that they expect to increase in value  debt holders  will benefit from the increase before equity holders   Distressed debt investors are  sometimes referred to as vulture investors   Other private equity strategies may involve providing specific financing  for exam  ple mezzanine funds  or investing in companies in specific industries   As the financial  environment changes and evolves  additional strategies may emerge 
6,160,   The term  mezzanine  stage financing  is used because this financing is provided at the stage between  being a private and public company  The focus is on when the financing occurs

3,161,      Exit Strategies
4,161,The ultimate goal for private equity is to improve new or underperforming businesses  and exit them at higher valuations   Private equity firms buy and hold companies for an  average of five years   The time to exit  however can range from less than   months to  more than    years   Before deciding on an exit strategy private equity managers take  into account the dynamics of the industry in which the portfolio company competes   overall economic cycles  interest rates  and company performance  Below are common exit strategies pursued by private equity portfolio managers      Trade sale  This strategy refers to the sale of a company to a strategic buyer  such as a competitor  A trade sale can be conducted through an auction pro  cess or by private negotiation  Benefits of a trade sale include  a  an immediate  cash exit for the private equity fund   b  potential for high valuation of the asset  because strategic buyers may be willing and able to pay more than other poten  tial buyers as a result of anticipated synergies    c  fast and simple execution    d  lower transaction costs than an IPO  and  e  lower levels of disclosure and  higher confidentiality than an IPO because the private equity firm is generally  dealing with only one other party  Disadvantages of trade sales include  a  possi  ble opposition by management    b  lower attractiveness to employees of the  portfolio company than an IPO   c  a limited number of potential trade buyers    and  d  a possible lower price than in an IPO     IPO  This approach involves the portfolio company selling its shares  including  some or all of those held by the private equity firm to public investors through  an IPO  Advantages for an IPO exit include  a  potential for the highest price    b  management approval because management will be retained   c  public  ity for the private equity firm  and  d  potential ability to retain future upside  potential because the private equity firm may choose to remain a large share  holder  Disadvantages for an IPO exit include  a  high transaction costs paid  to investment banks and lawyers    b  long lead times    c  risk of stock market  volatility    d  high disclosure requirements    e  potential lock  up period which  requires the private equity firm to retain an equity position for a specified  period after the IPO  and  f   the fact that an IPO is usually appropriate only for  larger companies with attractive growth profiles      Recapitalization  A recapitalization is not a true exit strategy because the  private equity firm typically maintains control  however it does allow the  private equity investor to extract money from the company  Recapitalization is  a very popular strategy when interest rates are low as the private equity firm  re  leverages or introduces leverage to the company and pays itself a dividend  A  recapitalization is often a prelude to a later exit      Secondary sales  This approach represents a sale to another private equity firm  or other group of investors      Write  off liquidation  A write  off occurs when a transaction has not gone well  and the private equity firm is updating its value of the investment or liquidating  the portfolio company to move on to other projects   The foregoing exit strategies may be pursued individually combined together or  used for a partial exit strategy  For example it is not unusual to see a private equity  fund sell a portion of a portfolio company to a competitor via a trade sale and then  complete a secondary sale to another private equity firm for the remaining portion   Company shares may also be distributed to fund investors  although such a move is  unusual

3,164,for a comparable business  divided by EBITDA   Net income and revenue multiples  may be based on the multiples from transactions in comparable companies but are  frequently based on heuristics    
4,164,EXAMPLE  
5,164,Portfolio Company Valuation
6,164,A private equity fund is considering purchasing a radio broadcaster that had  an EBITDA of      million  In the past year three radio broadcasting compa  nies were sold for     EBITDA       EBITDA  and     EBITDA   Based on this  information the maximum value the private equity fund is most likely to assign  to the broadcaster is   A       million  B       million  C       million 
7,164,Solution 
8,164,C is correct   The maximum value the private equity fund is most likely to assign  is that using the highest multiple            million         million   The min  imum value the seller may be willing to accept is that using the lowest multiple   In negotiations  growth prospects  risk  size current market conditions  and so  on will be considered 
9,164,A discounted cash flow  DCF  approach values a company or its equity as the  present value of the relevant expected future cash flows   Future free cash flow projec  tions may be discounted to compute a present value for the portfolio company or its  equity  Free cash flow to the firm discounted at the weighted average cost of capital  may be used to estimate the company  s value  Free cash flow to equity discounted  at the cost of equity may be used to estimate the value of the company  s equity  One  simple approach takes a measure such as income or cash flow and divides it by a capi  talization rate to arrive at a value estimate  This approach is conceptually different but  practically similar to using an income or cash  based multiple  If the value estimated  using a DCF approach is higher than the investment s current price the opportunity  may be an attractive one  An asset  based approach values a company using the values of its underlying assets  less the value of any related liabilities   In effect this approach arrives at the value of the  company to the equity holders   The approach assumes that a company  s value equals  the sum of the values of the company  s assets minus its liabilities   The valuations can  be arrived at using market  fair  values or other values such as liquidation values   Fair  values assume an orderly transaction whereas liquidation values assume a distressed  transaction  The liquidation value is an estimate of how much money could be raised  if a company  s assets were sold in a liquidation scenario  Liquidation value is the net  amount that will be realized if the business is terminated the assets are sold and the  liabilities are satisfied  In a weak economic environment  liquidation values will most  likely be far lower than the immediately previous fair values because there will tend  to be many assets for sale and fewer potential buyers

6,165,REAL ESTATE
7,165,Real estate investing is often thought of as direct or indirect ownership  equity investing   in real estate property such as land and buildings   Real estate investing  however also  includes lending  debt investing  against real estate property for example provid  ing a mortgage loan or purchasing mortgage  backed securities  MBS   The property  generally serves as collateral for the lending   Key reasons for investing in real estate include the following     Potential for competitive long  term total returns driven by both income genera  tion and capital appreciation     Prospect that multiple  year leases with fixed rents for some property types may  lessen cash flow effects from economic shocks      Likelihood that less  than  perfect correlation with other asset classes may pro  vide diversification benefits      Potential to provide an inflation hedge if rents can be adjusted quickly for  inflation  Real estate property ownership is represented by a title and may reflect access to  air rights  mineral rights  and surface rights in addition to the rights of use of buildings  and land  Titles can be purchased leased sold mortgaged or transferred together  or separately in whole or in part   Real estate investments may also be in the form of  partnerships  equity or debt   Much real estate is residential but if it is owned with  the intention to let  lease or rent it in order to generate income it is classified as  commercial  i e  income  producing  real estate  In addition to residential real estate  classified as commercial commercial real estate includes other types of real estate  properties such as office and retail properties   Some real estate properties may be  farmed provide forest products  or have natural resources that can be obtained by  extraction to generate income  The resulting products  such as wheat  timber gold  and oil are considered commodities   As a result  some investors include timberland

12,167,Within the basic forms  there can be many variations      Direct ownership can be free and clear whereby the title to the property is  transferred to the owner unencumbered by any financing lien such as from a  mortgage  Initial purchase costs associated with direct ownership may include  legal expenses  survey costs  engineering environmental studies  and valuation   appraisal  fees   Of course ongoing maintenance and refurbishment charges  are also incurred  The property must be managed which has related costs   The  owner may manage the property or may employ a local managing agent      Leveraged ownership occurs when the property title is obtained through an  equity purchase combined with mortgage financing   In addition to the initial  purchase costs  there are mortgage arrangement fees   A mortgage is secured  by the property and in the event of a breach of lending terms  the creditor can  petition for the title  Any appreciation  depreciation  of the property  s value  plus the net operating income in excess of the debt servicing costs provides  investors with a leveraged gain  loss  on their equity     Financing provided to leveraged owners is frequently in the form of stand  alone  mortgage loans   These loans represent passive investments in which the lender  expects to receive a predefined stream of payments throughout the finite life  of the mortgage  The loan may become a form of property ownership if the  borrower defaults   Investments may be in the form of  whole  loans based on  specific properties  typically direct investment through private markets  or  through participation in a pool of mortgage loans  typically indirect investment  in real estate through publicly traded securities such as MBS      Real estate equity investors may use different types of pooled vehicles arranged  by an intermediary  These vehicles include the following     Real estate limited partnerships offer exposure to real estate projects  while preserving limited liability  to the amount of the initial investment   and leaving management and liability to GPs who specialize in real estate  management      REITs issue shares that are typically publicly traded  REITs invest in various  types of real estate and provide retail investors with access to a diversified  real estate property portfolio and professional management   REITs are  required to distribute most of their taxable income to their shareholders      Securitization of residential and commercial mortgages provides retail and  institutional investors with access to a diversified portfolio of mortgages and  allows the original lenders to alter their portfolio of investments   Mortgages are  combined into pools and then into slices  called tranches  by investment banks

2,168,   
3,168,The tranches  each having different payment characteristics  are then sold to  investors   These securities are generally not considered alternative investments  but are held as part of the fixed  income  or credit  portfolio  REITs and partnerships have fees for managing the assets embedded in their val  uations   Fee structures for investment funds can be similar to those in private equity  with investment management fees based on committed capital or invested capital   These fees typically range from    to    of capital per annum  Funds also charge  performance  based fees  similar to a private equity fund 
4,168,    Real Estate Investment Categories
5,168,The majority of real estate property may be classified as either commercial or resi  dential  In this reading  residential properties are defined narrowly to include only  owner  occupied single residences  often referred to as single  family residential  property   Residential properties owned with the intention to let  lease or rent them  are classified as commercial  Commercial properties also include office retail indus  trial and warehouse and hospitality  e g   hotel and motel  properties   Commercial  properties may also have mixed uses   Commercial properties generate returns from  income  e g   rent  and capital appreciation  Several factors will affect opportunities  for capital appreciation including development strategies  market conditions  and  property  specific features  
6,168,      Residential Property
7,168,For many individuals and families  real estate investment takes the form of direct equity  investment  i e  ownership  in a residence with the intent to occupy    In other words   a home is purchased  Given the price of homes  most purchasers cannot provide the  entire financing  i e  pay cash  and must borrow funds to make the purchase  Any  appreciation  depreciation  in the value of the home increases  decreases  the owner  s  equity in the home  Financial institutions are the main providers  originators  of debt financing  typ  ically through mortgages  for home ownership  The originators of single  family res  idential mortgages are making a direct  debt investment in the home  Before offering  a mortgage the due diligence process should include the following     ensuring that the borrower is making an appropriate equity investment in the  home  in other words  paying an adequate proportion of the purchase price     conducting a credit review of the borrower    establishing that the borrower has sufficient cash flows to make the required  payments on the mortgage and to maintain the home    appraising  estimating the value of   the home and    ensuring that adequate and appropriate insurance is in place on the home and  in some cases  on the borrower  Home loans may be held on the originator  s balance sheet or securitized and  offered to the financial markets   Securitization provides indirect  debt investment  opportunities in residential property via securitized debt products  such as residential  mortgage  backed securities  RMBS  to other investors

4,169,Commercial property has traditionally been considered an appropriate direct invest  ment equity and debt for institutional funds or high  net  worth individuals with long  time horizons and limited liquidity needs   This perception of appropriateness for only  certain types of investors was primarily because of the complexity of the investments   the large investments required and the relative illiquidity of the investments   Direct   equity investing  i e  ownership  is further complicated because commercial property  requires active and experienced professional management   The success of the equity  investment is a function of a variety of factors  including how well the property is  managed general economic and specific real estate market conditions  and the extent  and terms of any debt financing   In order to provide direct debt financing  the lender  investor  will conduct finan  cial analyses to establish the borrower  s creditworthiness  to ensure that the property  will generate cash flows sufficient to service the debt  to estimate the value of the  property and to evaluate economic conditions   The estimate of the property value  is critical because the loan  to  value ratio is a critical factor in the lending decision   The borrower  s equity in the property is an indicator of commitment to the success  of the project and provides a cushion to the lender because the property is generally  used as collateral for the loan  Indirect investment vehicles provide individual investors with the opportunity to  invest in real estate  For example shares of REITs provide indirect  equity investment  opportunities in real estate and commercial mortgage  backed securities  CMBS   provide indirect  debt investment opportunities in real estate

21,170,Timberland offers an income stream based on the sale of timber products as a compo  nent of total return and has historically provided a return that is not highly correlated  with other asset classes   Timberland functions as both a factory and a warehouse   Timber can be grown and easily stored by not harvesting   This feature offers the  flexibility of harvesting more trees when timber prices are up and delaying harvests  when prices are down  Timberland has three primary return drivers  biological growth  commodity price changes  and land price changes   Farmland is often perceived to provide a hedge against inflation  Its returns include  an income component related to harvest quantities and agricultural commodity  prices   Farmland consists of two main property types   row crops that are planted and  harvested annually  i e  more than one planting and harvesting can occur in a year  depending on the crop and the climate  and permanent crops that grow on trees or  vines   Unlike with timberland farm products must be harvested when ripe so there is  little flexibility in harvesting   Farmland may also be used as pastureland for livestock    Similar to timberland farmland has three primary return drivers   harvest quantities   commodity prices  and land price changes

23,170,A variety of indexes globally are intended to measure returns to real estate  These  indexes vary however in the selection and valuation of components and longevity   A real estate index can generally be categorized as an appraisal index  a repeat sales   transaction  based  index  or a REIT index   Appraisal indexes use estimates of value   appraisals  as inputs   These appraisals  conducted by experts  rely on comparable sales  and cash flow analysis techniques   Even though the appraisals are done by experts   they are still subjective  The appraisals are done periodically often annually but some  appraised values included in an index may be from more than one year earlier  This  factor and the way appraisals are conducted may result in indexes that understate  volatility  Repeat sales indexes are constructed using repeat sales of properties   The changes  in property prices with repeat sales are measured and used to construct the index    These indexes suffer from a sample selection bias because the properties that sell  in each period vary and may not be representative of the larger market   Also the

17,172,    Real Estate Valuation
18,172,Until a property is actually sold real estate values can only be estimated  This estima  tion process is often referred to as appraising the property  A variety of approaches  are used to value real estate property  Common techniques for appraising real estate  property include comparable sales  income and cost approaches      Comparable sales approach  This approach involves determining an approx  imate value based on recent sales of similar properties   Adjustments are made  for differences in key characteristics of the property being appraised and the  sold properties identified as similar  Key characteristics include condition age  location and size  Adjustments are also made for price changes in the relevant  real estate market between dates of sales      Income approach  Direct capitalization and discounted cash flow approaches  are two income  based approaches to appraising an income  producing property     The direct capitalization approach estimates the value of an income   producing property based on the level and quality of its net operating  income  NOI   Similar to EBITDA  NOI represents the income to the prop  erty after deducting operating expenses  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance utilities  and repairs but before depreciation financing costs   and income taxes   NOI is a proxy for property  level operating cash flow  The  expected annual NOI is divided by a capitalization rate  cap rate  to estimate  the property  s value  A cap rate is a discount rate less a growth rate  The  reciprocal of the cap rate is a multiple that can be applied to NOI  The cap  rate is estimated for a given property based on relevant information includ  ing cap rates on sales of comparable properties  general business conditions   property quality and assessment of management   The analysis might include  assessing the strength of tenants  the level of landlord involvement  the  extent and adequacy of repairs and improvements  the vacancy rate man  agement and operating costs  and expected inflation of costs and rent

3,173,   The discounted cash flow approach discounts future projected cash flows  to arrive at a present value for the property  Typically the analysis involves  projections of annual operating cash flows for a finite number of periods  and a resale or reversion value at the end of that total period  The projected  resale value is often estimated using a direct capitalization approach     Cost approach  This approach evaluates the property  s replacement cost by  estimating the market value of the land and the costs of rebuilding using cur  rent construction costs and standards   Costs include building materials  labor  to build tenant improvements  and various  soft  costs  including architectural  engineering  and construction supervision costs   legal insurance and bro  kerage fees   and environmental assessment costs   The cost of rebuilding is the  replacement cost of the building s  in new condition and is adjusted to take into  account the location and condition of the existing building s   A combination and reconciliation of the values from the different approaches is typ  ically performed to increase confidence in the appraisal 
4,173,      REIT Valuations
5,173,REITs are composed of a portfolio of real estate properties or mortgages  and as a  result  a REIT security  s valuation depends on the entire pool s characteristics   There  are two basic approaches to estimating a REIT s intrinsic value  income based and asset  based  The value estimates can be compared with the REIT s observed market price  Income  based approaches for REITs are typically similar to the direct capitalization  approach  A measure of income which is a cash flow proxy is capitalized into a value  indication by using a cap rate  an alternative calculation could multiply the income  measure by the reciprocal of the cap rate   Two common measures used are funds from  operations  FFO  and adjusted funds from operations  AFFO   FFO in its most basic  form equals net income plus depreciation charges on real estate property less gains  from sales of real estate property plus losses on sales of real estate property  These  adjustments to net income effectively exclude depreciation and the gains and losses  from sales of real estate property from the FFO  Depreciation is excluded because  it represents a non  cash charge and is often unrelated to changes in the value of the  property  Gains and losses from sales are excluded because these are assumed to be  non  recurring   AFFO adjusts the FFO for recurring capital expenditures   It is similar  to a free cash flow measure  The cap rate and its reciprocal multiple are estimated based on a variety of factors   including market cap rates and current market and economic conditions  expecta  tions for growth in the relevant measure risks associated with the REIT s underlying  properties  the financial leverage of the REIT and multiples of recent transactions   Asset  based approaches calculate a REIT s NAV  Generally a REIT s NAV is calcu  lated as the estimated market value based on appraisals  of a REIT s total assets minus  the value of its total liabilities   REIT shares frequently trade at prices that differ from  NAV per share  Both premiums and discounts to the NAV are observed in the market 
6,173,    Real Estate Investment Risks
7,173,Real estate investments  like any investment  may fail to perform in accordance with  expectations   Property values are subject to variability based on national and global  economic conditions  local real estate conditions  and interest rate levels   Other risks  inherent to real estate investment include the ability of fund management to select   finance and manage real properties  as well as changes in government regulations    Management of the underlying properties includes handling rentals or leasing of the  property controlling expenses  directing maintenance and improvements  and ulti  mately disposing of the property  Expenses may increase because of circumstances

3,174,beyond management s control  Returns to both debt and equity investors in real estate  depend to a large extent on the ability of the owners or their agents to successfully  operate the underlying properties   Investments in distressed properties and property development are subject to  greater risks than investments in properties with stable operations and or in sound  financial condition  Property development is subject to special risks  including reg  ulatory issues  construction delays  and cost overruns   Regulatory issues include the  failure to receive zoning  occupancy and other approvals and permits  as well as the  effect of environmental regulation  Economic conditions can also change during the  development and disposition period which can be very lengthy  Adverse effects of  regulatory issues and changes in economic condition include increasing construction  time or the time until a property is fully leased out  increasing construction costs  and  decreasing the level of rents relative to initial expectations   Acquisitions and devel  opments may be financed with lines of credit or other forms of temporary financing  rather than long  term debt financing  There is a risk that long  term financing with  acceptable terms might not be available when desired  Financing problems with one  property may cause further activity by the same owner to be curtailed  It is important to recognize that many equity investment real estate funds pursue  leverage to potentially increase returns to their investors   Leverage magnifies the  effect of gains and losses  because of operations and changes in property value on  the equity investors   Leverage increases the risk to debt investors as well as to equity  investors   Leverage increases the risk that the real estate fund will have insufficient  funds to make expected interest payments and that the debt investor will receive less  than the entire principal  As the loan  to  value ratio increases  the latter risk increases

5,174,Commodities are physical products   Returns on commodity investments are based  on changes in price rather than on an income stream such as interest  dividends  or  rent   In fact  holding commodities  i e  the physical products  incurs costs for trans  portation and storage  Thus  most commodity investors do not trade actual physical  commodities but rather trade commodity derivatives   The underlying for a commodity  derivative may be a single commodity or an index of commodities   Trading in physical commodities is primarily limited to a smaller group of enti  ties that are part of the physical supply chain  Some investors that are not part of the  supply chain may invest in physical commodities  but the commodities are typically  those that are non  perishable of high value relative to weight and volume and easily  stored at relatively low cost   Most investors invest in commodities using commodity  derivatives   Because the prices of commodity derivatives are to a significant extent  a  function of the underlying commodity prices  however it is important to understand  the physical supply chain and general supply demand dynamics for a commodity   The supply chain consists of entities that actually produce the commodities  users of  the commodities  and participants in between  These entities may trade commodity  derivatives for hedging purposes   Other investors  sometimes referred to as speculators   trade commodity derivatives in search of profit based largely on changes or expected  changes in the price of the underlying commodities   Non  hedging investors include  retail and institutional investors  hedge funds  proprietary desks within financial  institutions  and trading desks operating within the physical supply chain  Commodities include precious and base  i e  industrial  metals  energy products   and agricultural products   Exhibit    shows some examples of each type  The relative  importance amount and price of individual commodities evolve with society  s prefer  ences and needs   The increasing industrialization of China  India  and other emerging

5,176,Commodity exposure can be achieved through other means than direct investment in  commodities or commodity derivatives   Although commodity exposure is most com  monly accessed via commodity derivatives  either directly or through an investment  manager alternative means are becoming increasingly popular  Alternative means of  achieving commodity exposure include the following     Exchange  traded funds may be suitable for investors who can buy only equity  shares or seek the simplicity of trading them  ETFs may invest in commodities  or futures of commodities  often specializing in a particular sector  seeking  to track the performance of the commodities   For example the SPDR Gold  Shares ETF attempts to track the price of gold  It owned more than     billion  in gold bullion as of November      and more than     billion in gold bullion  as of October       There are also commodity index  linked ETFs   ETFs may  use leverage  Similar to mutual funds or unit trusts  ETFs charge fees that are  included in their expense ratios  although the ETF expense ratios are generally  lower than those of most mutual funds      Common stock of companies exposed to a particular commodity such as  Royal Dutch Shell which is exposed to oil may be purchased  Investors may  consider owning shares in a few commodity  exposed companies in order to  have a small exposure to commodities   It is unclear however whether the  performance of these stocks closely tracks the performance of the underlying  commodity ies      Managed futures funds are actively managed investment funds   Professional  money managers invest in the futures market  and forward market sometimes   on behalf of the funds   These funds historically focused on commodity futures   but today they may invest in other futures contracts as well  Managed futures  funds may concentrate on specific commodity sectors or may be broadly  diversified  They are similar to hedge funds in that each fund has a GP and fees  typically follow a    and     structure  The funds may operate similarly to mutual  funds with shares that are available to the general public or they may operate  like hedge funds and restrict sales to high  net  worth and institutional investors    The former may appeal to retail investors because of the professional manage  ment  low minimum investment  and relatively high liquidity

4,177,    Commodity Performance and Diversification Benefits
5,177,The arguments for investing in commodities include the potential for returns  portfolio  diversification and inflation protection  Investors may invest in commodities if they  believe prices will increase in the short or intermediate terms   If commodity prices  determine inflation index levels  then over time on average commodities should yield  a zero real return  Commodity futures contracts may offer liquidity or other premiums   creating the opportunity for a real return different from zero  The portfolio diversification argument is based on the observation that commod  ities historically have behaved differently from stocks and bonds during the business  cycle  Exhibit    shows the correlation between selected commodities  global equity  and global bond indexes   In the     year period from      through      commodities  exhibited a low correlation with traditional assets  the correlations of commodities with  global stocks and global bonds were       and       respectively  The correlations of  stocks  bonds  and commodities are expected to be positive because each of the assets  has some exposure to the global business cycle  Note that the selected commodity  index  the S P GSCI  Goldman Sachs Commodity Index   is heavily weighted toward  the energy sector and that each commodity may exhibit unique behavior

12,178,    Commodity Prices and Investments
13,178,Commodity spot prices are a function of supply and demand costs of production  and storage value to users  and global economic conditions   Non  hedging investors  with positions in physical commodities may be accumulating or divesting a particular  commodity  Supplies of commodities are determined by production and inventory  levels as well as the actions of non  hedging investors   Demand for commodities is  determined by the needs of end users and the actions of non  hedging investors   Commodity supplies cannot be altered quickly by producers because extended  lead times may exist and affect production levels   For example agricultural output  may be altered by planting more crops and changing farming techniques  but at least  one growing cycle is required before the actual output occurs   And for agricultural  products  at least one factor that is outside of the producer  s control the weather will  significantly affect output  Increased oil and mining production may require a number  of years   Weather can also have a significant effect on oil production in parts of the  world  For commodities  suppliers  inability to quickly respond to changes in demand  levels may result in supply levels that are too low in times of economic growth and  too high in times of economic slowing   In addition despite advancing technology  the cost of new supply may grow over time  For example the cost of new energy and  mineral exploration tends to exceed that of past finds because easy discoveries tend  to be exploited first   If production costs are high producers are unlikely to produce  more than what is needed to meet anticipated demand and are unlikely to maintain  more than modest levels of inventory  Overall demand levels are influenced by global manufacturing dynamics and eco  nomic growth  Manufacturing needs can change in a period of months as orders and  inventories vary  Investors seek to anticipate these changes by monitoring economic  events  including government policy inventory levels  and growth forecasts   When  demand levels and investors  orders to buy and sell during a given period change  quickly the resulting mismatch of supply and demand may lead to price volatility 
14,178,      Pricing of Commodity Futures Contracts
15,178,It is important to understand futures contracts and the sources of return for each  commodity futures contract because commodity investments often involve the use of  futures contracts   These contracts trade on exchanges   The buyer  i e  the long side  of  a futures contract is obligated to take delivery of the commodity or its cash equivalent  based on the spot price at expiration and will pay a settlement price  The settlement
1,179,   
2,179,Reading      Introduction to Alternative Investments
3,179,price is an amount specified in the contract or the previous mark  to  market price if  the contract has been marked to market   In other words  the long side is obligated  to buy the commodity at the settlement price  The long side of a futures contract  increases in value when the underlying commodity increases in value  The seller of a  futures contract  i e  the short side  is obligated to deliver the commodity or its cash  equivalent based on the spot price at expiration and will receive the settlement price  Futures positions are often closed over the life of the contract by taking the oppo  site position to that originally entered into  In other words  the long side will sell an  identical futures contract  and the short side will buy an identical futures contract    If a contract is outstanding at expiration it is typically not settled by delivery and  receipt of the physical commodity but rather is settled by cash equal to the difference  between the cash equivalent and settlement price  If a contract is physically settled  specific rules apply that define the characteristics of acceptable delivery such as the  quality of the commodity and the delivery location  Parties to a futures contract are required to make an initial margin payment on  the contract   each party has a separate margin account   Futures contracts and margin  accounts are typically marked to market daily  On a daily basis  the futures exchange  calculates price changes in the contract and the values of the margin accounts given  the new price  If the value in a margin account declines sufficiently the investor will  receive a margin call and will be required to make an additional payment into the  margin account   If the investor is unable or unwilling to do so the investor  s position  will be closed  Given the characteristics of a commodity the price of a futures contract  futures  price  may be approximated by the following formula    Futures price   Spot price      r    Storage costs   Convenience yield where r is the period s short  term risk  free interest rate  Arbitrage opportunities exist  if the futures price differs from the spot price compounded at the risk  free rate  For  example if a commodity  s spot price is     the risk  free rate is    and the one  year  futures price is     as opposed to     an arbitrageur can buy the commodity for      and sell a futures contract for      Assuming no storage costs  when the commodity  is delivered for     the arbitrageur earns   points in excess of that earned investing  in the risk  free asset   Commodities typically incur a storage cost  however  The buyer  of a futures contract  in effect  gains access to the commodity in the future without  buying it now and incurring storage costs   The futures price includes an amount for  storage costs of the underlying commodity during the life of the contract   The storage  and interest costs together are sometimes referred to as  the cost of carry   or  the  carry   Finally the buyer of the futures contract has no immediate access to the com  modity but will receive it in the future  The buyer has given up the convenience of  having physical possession of the commodity and having it immediately available for  use  The futures price is adjusted for the loss of convenience  the convenience yield is  subtracted to arrive at the futures price  The value of convenience may vary over time  and across users   For example the convenience yield to having heating oil in January  in Canada is higher than the convenience yield to having heating oil in Canada in July  or to having heating oil in Australia in January  Futures prices may be higher or lower than spot prices depending on the con  venience yield  When futures prices are higher than the spot price the commodity  forward curve is upward sloping  and the prices are referred to as being in contango   Contango occurs when there is little or no convenience yield  When futures prices

4,180,INFRASTRUCTURE
5,180,The assets underlying infrastructure investments are real capital intensive long  lived  assets  which are intended for public use and provide essential services   Most infra  structure assets are financed owned and operated by governments  but increasingly  infrastructure assets are being financed privately  The use of public private partner  ships  PPPs  is increasing   By the end of      unlisted funds had invested more than       billion in infrastructure projects  up from    billion in         The intent of infrastructure investor s  may be to lease the assets back to the gov  ernment  to sell newly constructed assets to the government  or to hold and operate  the assets   From an investment perspective if the assets are being held and operated  the relatively inelastic demand for the assets and services is advantageous   regulation  and the high costs of the assets create high barriers to entry which give the provider  of the services a strong competitive position  Investors expect these assets to generate  stable cash flows  which adjust for economic growth and inflation  Investors may also  expect capital appreciation depending on the type of investment   Investing in infrastructure may enable investors to add a steady income stream to  further diversify their portfolio by adding an asset class with low correlation to other  investments  and to gain some protection against inflation  Infrastructure investments   which are in long  lived assets  may also better match the longer  term liability structure  of some investors  such as pension funds and life insurance companies   Allocations to

4,181,    Categories of Infrastructure Investments
5,181,Infrastructure investments are frequently categorized based on underlying assets   The  broadest categorization is into economic and social infrastructure assets   Economic  infrastructure assets are necessary to support economic activity and include assets  such as transportation and utility assets   Transportation assets include assets such as  roads  bridges  tunnels  airports  ports  and railway lines   Utility assets include assets  to transmit  store and distribute gas  water and electricity   generate power   treat  waste  and broadcast and transmit information  The latter assets may be categorized  separately as communication assets   Social infrastructure assets are directed toward  human activities and include assets such as educational healthcare and correctional  facilities   Infrastructure investments may also be categorized by the underlying asset s  stage of development   Investing in existing infrastructure assets may be referred to  as brownfield investment   The assets may be currently owned by a government that  wants to privatize the asset  to lease out the asset  or to sell and lease back the asset    Typically some financial and operating history is available on the asset   Investing  in infrastructure assets that are to be constructed may be referred to as greenfield  investment   The intent may be to hold and operate the assets or to lease or sell the  assets to the government after construction  Infrastructure investments may also be categorized by the geographical location  of the underlying assets   Infrastructure investments are available globally  Risks and  expected returns may differ based on the underlying asset s category stage of devel  opment  and geographical location  The form of investment also affects risks and  expected returns  
6,181,    Forms of Infrastructure Investments
7,181,Infrastructure investments  similar to real estate investments  may take a variety of  forms   The investment form potentially affects the investment s liquidity as well as  the cash flows and income streams to the investor  An investor may invest directly in  the underlying assets  but most investors invest indirectly  Investing directly in infra  structure provides control over the asset and the opportunity to capture the asset s full  value  But it entails a large investment  resulting in concentration and liquidity risks   and the assets must be managed and operated  Indirect investment vehicles include  shares of companies  ETFs  listed funds  private equity funds  and unlisted mutual funds  that invest in infrastructure  Investors concerned about liquidity may choose to invest  through publicly traded infrastructure securities and or master limited partnerships   Publicly traded infrastructure securities provide the benefit of not only liquidity but  also reasonable fees  transparent governance market prices  and the ability to diversify  across underlying assets   An investor should be aware however that publicly traded  infrastructure securities represent a small segment of the infrastructure investment  universe and tend to be clustered in categories of assets   Master limited partnerships   MLPs  trade on exchanges and are pass  through entities similar to REITs   Similar to  REITs  regulations may vary across countries  and income is allocated to the investors  for taxation  MLPs generally distribute most free cash flow to their investors   Typically  the GP manages the partnership receives a fee and holds a small partnership interest   LPs own the remaining partnership interest

3,182,    Risks and Returns Overview
4,182,The lowest  risk infrastructure investments have more  stable cash flows and higher  dividend payout ratios but also typically have fewer growth opportunities and lower  expected returns compared with higher  risk infrastructure investments   For example  an investment in an MLP with a brownfield investment in an asset that is being leased  back to a government  such as a school or in an asset with a history of steady cash  flows  such as some toll roads  represents a low  risk infrastructure investment   An  investment in a private equity fund with a greenfield investment is a riskier investment  Risks include revenues being different than expected leverage creating financing  risk  operational risk  and construction risk   An inherent risk for many infrastructure  investments is regulatory risk   Because essential services are often being provided  governments typically regulate many aspects of infrastructure investments  including  the sale of the underlying assets  operations of the assets including service quality  and prices profit margins   Global infrastructure investing introduces additional risks   such as currency political and profit repatriation risks   Preqin maintains a return series of private funds investing in infrastructure deals    Standard and Poor  s  FTSE  and other firms publish indexes of publicly traded infra  structure companies   For the five years ending December       the Preqin index    returned       per annum the S P and FTSE infrastructure indexes returned on  average       and the MSCI global equity index  ACWI  returned      
5,182,OTHER ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
6,182,Numerous other investments do not fit within the definition of traditional investments   i e  long  only investments in stocks  bonds  and cash  and may be considered alter  native investments   Many of these other investments are categorized as collectibles   Collectibles are tangible assets such as antiques and fine art fine wine rare stamps  and coins  jewelry and watches  and sports memorabilia   Collectibles do not provide  current income but they can potentially provide long  term capital appreciation  diversify a portfolio and be a source of enjoyment while held  There is no guarantee  however that an investor will realize any of these benefits   Collectibles can fluctuate  dramatically in value and be highly illiquid with potential difficulty in realizing gains    Transactions can occur in a number of ways and settings  including through profes  sional auctioneers   in local flea markets  online auctions  garage sales  and antique  stores   or directly with personal collectors   Investors must have a degree of expertise   otherwise one may be vulnerable to fads  fakes  and fraud  Also some collectibles must  be stored in appropriate conditions to preserve their condition and avoid declines in  value because of the asset s deterioration  Wine should be cellared art should be kept  in a humidity  and temperature  controlled environment  and coins and stamps must  be handled with care to preserve their values   Although some collectibles  e g   some  great wines   fine art   and rare stamps  coins  and trading cards  have experienced great  appreciation this result is by no means the norm  A number of indexes provide information about returns to these investments    None of these indexes is necessarily reliable or representative of performance for a  collectibles asset class as a whole  For instance the Stanley Gibbons GB    Stamp  Index measures the performance using retail and auction prices  of     rare stamps  traded in Great Britain  This index has increased from          at the end of

5,183,RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
6,183,Alternative investments pose unusual challenges for investors seeking to manage risk    They are often characterized by asymmetric risk and return profiles  limited portfolio  transparency and illiquidity  Investors in alternatives may be exposed to a variety of  risks  including operational risk  financial risk  counterparty risk  and liquidity risk    The returns to some types of alternatives  such as private equity may rely to a great  extent on manager skill rather than on general asset class performance  For these  reasons  traditional risk and return measures  such as mean return standard deviation  of returns  and beta  may not provide an adequate picture of alternative investments   characteristics   Moreover these measures may be unreliable or not representative of  specific investments  
7,183,    Investment and Risk Management Process
8,183,Investment risk management is not solely the responsibility of either the investor or  the manager of an investment portfolio  The investor possibly in consultation with  others  decides on an allocation to alternative investments   The investor then needs to  decide the vehicles and managers of the investments as well as the amounts that will  be allocated to each alternative investment class and manager  Risk has to be taken  into account and due diligence conducted in making these decisions   The investment  portfolio manager makes investment decisions consistent with the portfolio s estab  lished investment policies  taking risk into account   Investor due diligence should be  used to ensure the portfolio manager effectively manages portfolio risk   Pension con  sultants  wealth managers  and individual investors all recognize that risk management  processes can differ substantially between different alternative investment categories

3,184,      Risk Management Issues
4,184,Risks vary across alternative investments   The risks associated with investing in private  markets  e g   private equity funds and real estate ownership  differ from the risks  associated with investing in publicly traded markets  e g   commodity futures and  REITs   Private equity and direct real estate ownership may involve selecting companies  or properties  managing them and then selling them years later  Private equity and  hedge funds may have long lockup periods   As a result  investors  funds may be tied  up for years   Intermediate valuations are challenging   As a result  any malfeasance  or mismanagement may go undetected for years  so investor due diligence is critical   The illiquid nature of alternative investments also means that poor manager selection  can create a lingering drag on the portfolio  Limited partnership vehicles may limit  the visibility of underlying holdings and liquidity to investor assets   Portfolios of publicly traded securities are more liquid and have prices that are  more timely and observable than those of privately held assets   For investors who seek  liquidity publicly traded securities such as shares of REITs  ETFs  and publicly traded  private equity firms may serve as the means for investing in alternatives  
5,184,      Risk Issues for Implementation
6,184,For allocation purposes  the investor should recognize that historical returns and the  standard deviation of those returns using indexes may not be representative of the  returns and volatility of alternative investments   Further those investments  reported  correlations with other investments may vary from the actual correlations   As is always  the case even if these are relevant and representative measures of historical perfor  mance past performance is not necessarily representative of future performance  The  performance of alternative investments can be highly correlated with the business  cycle especially commodities and real estate investments  and may be susceptible to  bubbles  i e  much higher prices than justified by fundamentals   Investors should  consider valuation before making allocation changes   When selecting managers or funds  the investor should recognize that returns  and risks may differ significantly among individual managers or funds and the overall  investment class   Large institutional investors deal with this challenge by diversifying  across managers or funds  but this approach may not be practical for smaller investors    As a result  these smaller investors may invest in  publicly traded  or with  private  a  few large diversified funds   Alternative investment portfolio managers need to be mindful of several risks   In the  case of illiquid investments  most notably in private equity or venture capital there is a  real possibility of      loss of equity on individual investments   As a result portfolios  should be diversified sufficiently to reduce the possibility of this outcome happening  to all investments   Investors commonly require managers to follow diversification  concentration guidelines to limit these risks   At the same time the manager should  avoid diluting the opportunity for making substantial returns by arbitrarily identifying  a target number of investments and in the process  selecting inferior investments    Managers should consider and manage the risk associated with the use of leverage  Performance fee structures  although high may encourage alignment of interests  between investors and managers   Established portfolio managers  however may seek  to attract large amounts of capital and to profit from the management fees based on  AUM or committed capital without seeking superior performance  Performance fees  may also encourage hedge fund managers who experience a large loss to liquidate  their funds instead of working them back to par

3,185,      Due Diligence Issues Regarding Risk
4,185,Due diligence of alternative investment managers necessitates special procedures   over and above the process required for a manager of a portfolio of publicly traded  securities   Historical performance measures may be unreliable or not representative  as a result of intermediate valuation estimates and narrow portfolio diversification   With limited transparency and long horizons of many alternative investments  the  honesty of the company  s staff needs to be carefully reviewed  Hedge funds will have trading desks much like long  only investment firms  but  private equity and real estate companies usually make investment decisions via an  investment committee of partners   The investment committee may or may not include  external non  executive directors or subject matter experts   The committee votes on  the rationale analysis  and suitability of every investment and requires a majority in  favor before investor funds are committed  This committee may also oversee and vote  on investments  exit strategies  including timing and realization price  Independent valuation of illiquid underlying assets should be performed regularly   Often this analysis is done in conjunction with a portfolio review explaining the per  formance of every transaction in detail its status  and future strategy for the portfolio   Limits on security type leverage sector geography and individual positions should  be well defined in the offering memorandum and the positions should be carefully  monitored by the manager and regularly reported to clients   Hedge fund risk is often monitored by a chief risk officer who should be separated  from the investment process   As part of the risk management process  a hedge fund  needs to establish and maintain limits on leverage sector and individual positions    Investments in commodities may be subject to counterparty risks as well as leverage  risks   The exposure to counterparty risk and leverage risk should be regularly monitored  and reported  Policies limiting leverage positions  and sectors as well as counterparty  exposures may be adopted  One issue for investors is that hedge and commodity funds may seek to keep their  positions and strategies private  This lack of transparency makes it difficult for the  investor to effectively manage diversification across funds and to conduct adequate  due diligence 
5,185,    Risk Return Measures
6,185,The Sharpe ratio is a risk return measure frequently reported because of its ease  of calculation and understandability  The Sharpe ratio may not be the appropriate  risk return measure for some alternative investments because measures of return and  standard deviation may be irrelevant or unreliable given the assets  illiquid nature  The  illiquid nature of these assets means that estimates  rather than observable transaction  prices  may be used for valuation purposes   As a result  returns may be smoothed  and or overstated and the volatility of returns understated  Also the use of standard  deviation to measure risk ignores the diversification effect for a broad portfolio of  managers and alternative investments   Many alternative investments do not exhibit close  to  normal distributions of  returns  which is a crucial assumption for standard deviation s validity as a com  prehensive risk measure  Alternative investment returns tend to be leptokurtic   or negatively skewed  in other words  they have fat tails characterized by positive  average returns and long  tails downside characterized by potential extreme losses    For this reason a measure of downside risk  ideally non  normal would be useful   Downside risk measures focus on the left side of the return distribution curve where  losses occur  For example value at risk  VaR  is a measure of the minimum amount  of loss expected for a given period at a given level of probability  In other words  this  measure answers a question such as   What is the minimum amount expected to be
1,186,Risk Management Overview
2,186,   
3,186,lost in a year with a    probability   This measure however if it is calculated using  standard deviation will underestimate the VaR for a negatively skewed distribution   Shortfall or safety  first risk measures the probability that the portfolio value will fall  below some minimum acceptable level over a given period  In other words  this mea  sure answers a question such as   What is the probability of losing     of principal  in any given year   Shortfall risk also uses standard deviation as the measure of risk    The Sortino ratio another risk return measure uses downside deviation rather than  standard deviation as a measure of risk   Assuming normal probability distributions  when calculating these measures will lead to underestimating downside risk for a  negatively skewed distribution  Understanding and evaluating  tail events  low  probability high  severity instances  of stress is an important yet extraordinarily difficult aspect of the risk management  process   Stress testing scenario analysis is often used as a complement to VaR to  develop a better understanding of a portfolio s potential loss under both normal and  stressed market conditions   Stress testing involves estimating losses under extremely  unfavorable conditions  
4,186,    Due Diligence Overview
5,186,Manager selection is a critical factor in portfolio performance  A manager should have  a verifiable track record and display a high level of expertise and experience with the  asset type  The asset management team should be assigned an appropriate workload  and provided sufficient resources   Moreover it should be rewarded with an effective  compensation package to ensure alignment of interest  continuity motivation and  thoughtful oversight of assets   Fraud although infrequent is always a possibility  The investor should be skeptical  of unusually good and overly consistent reported performance  Third  party custody  of assets and independent verification of results can help reduce the chance of an  investor being defrauded  Diversification across managers is also wise  For an investor considering a new investment  a proper due diligence process  should be carried out to ensure that the targeted investment is in compliance with  its prospectus and that it will meet her investment strategy risk and return objec  tives  and restrictions   Existing investors should monitor results and fund holdings  to determine whether a fund has performed in line with expectations and continues  to comply with its prospectus   Exhibit     lists key items that should be considered in a typical due diligence  process

4,188,This reading has provided an overview of the characteristics  potential benefits  and  risks of alternative investments   It also described features of some categories of alter  native investments   Including alternative investments in an investor  s portfolio may  result in benefits  such as diversification benefits   These benefits do not come without  associated risks  however  It is important that investors understand these risks before  including alternative investments in their portfolios   Some key points of the reading  are summarized as follows      Alternative investments are alternatives to long  only positions in stocks  bonds   and cash  Alternative investments include investments in assets such as real  estate and commodities as well as investments in special vehicles such as pri  vate equity and hedge funds      Alternative investment strategies are typically active return  seeking strategies      Characteristics common to many alternative investments  compared with tradi  tional investments  include lower liquidity less regulation lower transparency  higher fees  and limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return  data      Alternative investments often have unusual legal and tax considerations and  may be highly leveraged     Alternative investments are attractive to investors because of the potential for  diversification  reduced risk  and or higher returns when added to a portfolio of  traditional investments      The risks associated with alternative investments must be factored into the  investment decision  making process      Many alternative investments are valued for performance  reporting purposes   including reporting to index providers  using estimated values rather than  actual market prices   As a result  the volatility of returns and correlation of  returns with the returns to traditional investments will tend to be underesti  mated  It is important to identify and understand how alternative investments  are valued     Indexes for alternative investments may be subject to a variety of biases  includ  ing survivorship and backfill biases      Many alternative investments  such as hedge and private equity funds  use a  partnership structure with a general partner that manages the business and  limited partners  investors  who own fractional interests in the partnership     The general partner typically receives a management fee based on assets under  management or committed capital  the former is common to hedge funds and  the latter is common to private equity funds  and an incentive fee based on  realized profits      Hurdle rates  high  water marks  lockup and notice periods  and clawback provi  sions may also be specified in a partnership agreement      The fee structure affects the returns to investors  limited partners  in alternative  investments such as hedge and private equity funds      Hedge funds are typically classified by strategy  One such classification includes  four broad categories of strategies   event  driven relative value macro and  equity hedge
