2,16,Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial services firm   You and your colleagues spend your days researching analyzing and valuing the shares of  publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recommendations with clients  You  love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing that your recommendations can help the  firm s investing clients make informed investment decisions that will help them meet their  financial goals and improve their lives 
3,16,Several months after starting at the firm you learn that an analyst at the firm has been  terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the fundamental risks  of some companies to investors  You learn that the analyst wrote the reports with the goal of  pleasing the management of the companies that were the subjects of the research reports  He  hoped that these companies would hire your firm s investment banking division for its services  and he would be rewarded with large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment  banking fees  Some clients bought shares based on the analyst s reports and suffered losses   They posted stories on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports   When the media investigated and published the story the firm s reputation for investment  research suffered  Investors began to question the firm s motives and the objectivity of its  research recommendations  The firm s investment clients started to look elsewhere for  investment advice and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms with  untarnished reputations  With business declining management is forced to trim staff  Along  with many other hard working colleagues you lose your job through no fault of your own 
4,16,Imagine how you would feel in this situation  Most people would feel upset and resentful that  their hard and honest work was derailed by someone else s unethical behavior  Yet this type of  scenario is not uncommon  Around the world unsuspecting employees at such companies as  SAC Capital Stanford Financial Group Everbright Securities Enron Satyam Computer  Services Arthur Andersen and other large companies have experienced such career setbacks  when someone else s actions destroyed trust in their companies and industries 
5,16,Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust defined as a strong belief in the reliability of  a person or institution  In a      study on trust investors indicated that to earn their trust the  top three attributes of an investment manager should be that it     has transparent and open  business practices     takes responsible actions to address an issue or crisis and     has ethical  business practices   Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry this reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment  industry 
6,16,People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws regulations and other  rules but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in which there is no  definitive rule that specifies how to act or the rules that exist may be unclear or even in conflict  with each other  Responsible people including investment professionals must be willing and  able to identify potential ethical issues and create solutions to them even in the absence of  clearly stated rules

2,17,   ETHICS
3,17,Through our individual actions each of us can affect the lives of others  Our decisions and  behavior can harm or benefit a variety of stakeholders individuals or groups of individuals  who could be affected either directly or indirectly by a decision and thus have an interest or  stake in the decision  Examples of stakeholders in decisions made by investment industry  professionals include our colleagues our clients our employers the communities in which we  live and work the investment profession and other financial market participants  In some cases  our actions may benefit all of these stakeholder groups  in other cases our actions may benefit  only some stakeholder groups  and in still other cases our actions may benefit some stakeholder  groups and harm others  For example recall the research analyst in the introduction who wrote  misleading research reports with the aim of increasing the financial benefit to himself and his  employer  In the very short term his conduct seemed to directly benefit some stakeholders   certain clients himself and his employer  and to harm other stakeholders  clients who invested  based on his reports   Over a longer time period his conduct resulted in harm to himself and  many other stakeholders his employer his employer s clients his colleagues investors and  through loss of trust when the story was published the larger financial market 
4,17,Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our  behavior  The word  ethics  comes from the Greek word  ethos  meaning character used to  describe the guiding beliefs or ideals characterizing a society or societal group  Beliefs are  assumptions or thoughts we hold to be true  A principle is defined as a belief or fundamental  truth that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or a chain of reasoning   Our beliefs form our values those things we deem to have worth or merit 
5,17,Moral principles or ethical principles are beliefs regarding what is good acceptable or  obligatory behavior and what is bad unacceptable or forbidden behavior  Ethical principles  may refer to beliefs regarding behavior that an individual expects of himself or herself as well  as shared beliefs regarding standards of behavior expected or required by a community or  societal group 
6,17,Another definition of ethics is the study of moral principles which can be described as the  study of good and bad behavior or the study of making good choices as opposed to bad choices   The study of ethics examines the role of consequences and personal character in defining what  is considered good or ethical conduct 
7,17,Ethical conduct is behavior that follows moral principles and balances self interest with both  the direct and the indirect consequences of the behavior on others  Ethical actions are those  actions that are perceived as beneficial and conforming to the ethical expectations of society   An action may be considered beneficial if it improves the outcomes or consequences for  stakeholders affected by the action  Telling the truth about the risks or costs associated with a  recommended investment for example is an ethical action that is one that conforms to the  ethical expectations of society in general and clients in particular  Telling the truth is also  beneficial  telling the truth builds trust with customers and clients and enables them to make  more informed decisions which should lead to better outcomes for them and higher levels of  client customer satisfaction for you and your employer

2,18,Widely acknowledged ethical principles include honesty fairness or justice diligence and  respect for the rights of others  Most societal groups share these fundamental ethical principles  and build on them establishing a shared set of rules regarding how members should behave in  certain situations  The principles or rules may take different forms depending on the community  establishing them 
3,18,Governments and related entities for example may establish laws and or regulations to reflect  widely shared beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct  Laws and regulations are rules of  conduct specified by a governing body such as a legislature or a regulator identifying how  individuals and entities under its jurisdiction should behave in certain situations  Most countries  have laws and regulations governing the investment industry and the conduct of its participants   Differences in laws may reflect differences in beliefs and values 
4,18,In some countries for example the law requires that an investment adviser act in the best  interests of his or her clients  Other countries require that investment professionals recommend  investments that are suitable for their clients  Investment advisers and portfolio managers who  are required by law to act in their clients  best interests must always put their clients  interests  ahead of their own or their employers  interests  An investment adviser who is required by law  to act in a client s best interest must understand the client s financial objectives and risk  tolerance research and investigate multiple investment opportunities and recommend the  investment or investment portfolio that is most suitable for the client in terms of meeting his or  her long term financial objectives  In addition the investment adviser would be expected to  monitor the client s financial situation and investments to ensure that the investments  recommended remain the best overall option for meeting the client s long term financial  objectives  In countries with only a suitability requirement it is legal for investment  professionals to recommend a suitable investment to a client even if other similar suitable  investments with lower fees are available  These differences in laws reflect differences in  beliefs and values 
5,18,Specific communities or societal groups in which we live and work sometimes codify their  beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct in a written set of principles often called a code  of ethics  Universities employers and professional associations often adopt a code of ethics to  communicate the organization s values and overall expectations regarding member behavior   The code of ethics serves as a general guide for how community members should act  Some  communities will also expand on their codes of ethics and adopt explicit rules or standards that  identify specific behaviors required of community members  These standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members and can  help clarify the code of ethics  Members can choose behaviors that demonstrate even higher  standards  By joining the community members are agreeing to adhere to the community s code  of ethics and standards of conduct  To promote their code of ethics and reduce the incidence of  violations communities frequently display their codes in prominent locations and in written  materials  In addition most communities require that members commit to their codes in writing  on an annual or more frequent basis 
6,18,Violations of a community s established code of ethics and or standards of conduct can harm  the community in a variety of ways  Violations have the potential to damage the community s  reputation among external stakeholders and the general public  Violations can also damage the  community s reputation internally and lead to reduced trust among community members and  can cause the organization to fracture or splinter from within  To protect the reputation of its  membership and limit potential harm to innocent members the community may take corrective  actions to investigate possible violations repair any damages and attempt to discipline the  violator or in severe cases revoke the violator s membership in the community

2,19,CFA Institute is an example of a community with an established code of ethics and standards of  conduct  Its members and candidates commit to adhere to shared beliefs about acceptable  conduct for individuals participating in the investment industry  These beliefs are presented in  the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct  Code and Standards  which are  included in the CFA Institute Standards of Practice Handbook  The Code of Ethics  communicates the organization s principles values and expectations  For example the Code  states that members and candidates  place the integrity of the investment profession and the  interests of clients above their own personal interests   The Standards of Professional Conduct  outline minimally acceptable behaviors expected of all CFA Institute members and candidates   For example one standard requires that  Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of  their clients and place their clients  interests before their employer s or their own interests    Another standard requires that  Members and Candidates must make full and fair disclosure of  all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or  interfere with respective duties to their clients prospective clients and employer  Members and  Candidates must ensure that such disclosures are prominent are delivered in plain language  and communicate the relevant information effectively  
3,19,CFA Institute members and candidates re affirm their commitment to adhere to the Code and  Standards each year  In addition to protect the reputation of the community members and  candidates agree to submit a Professional Conduct Statement each year disclosing conduct that  may have violated the Code and Standards  To protect members and candidates CFA Institute  has an established disciplinary process  Members and candidates who violate the Code and  Standards are subject to disciplinary action

2,20,Solution to   
3,20,C is correct  Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable  behavior required of members of a group  Some organizations will adopt only a code of  ethics which communicates the organization s values and overall expectations  regarding member behavior  Others may adopt both a code of ethics and standards of  conduct  Standards of conduct identify specific behavior required of community  members and serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community  members 
4,20,   ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM
5,20,As you progress in your career you may find that attitudes among your peers vary  Some of  your peers may be happy to have a job others may consider themselves fortunate to find a  vocation and some may consider themselves part of a profession  What are the differences  A  job is very simply the work someone does to earn a living  A vocation is a job or occupation to  which someone is particularly well suited and is very dedicated  Often people will refer to a  vocation as a calling  They work in service of a cause they consider worthy  A profession is the  ultimate evolution of an occupation resulting from the efforts of members practicing the  occupation at a high level and creating a set of ethics and standards of conduct for the entire  group  A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from ordinary occupations  A  profession is
6,20,   based on specialized knowledge and skills 
7,20,   based on service to others 
8,20,   practiced by members who share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics 
9,20,Professionals use their specialized knowledge and skills to serve their clients with whom they  have a special relationship and to whom they have a special duty  Clients differ from customers   A customer purchases goods or services in a single transaction or series of transactions and pays  for each transaction or series of transactions  A client in contrast enters into an ongoing  relationship with a professional hiring the professional to use his or her special knowledge for  the benefit of the client usually for a fee  The relationship between client and professional is  based on trust rather than transactions  In exchange for the agreed on fee the professional  accepts the duty to place the client s interests first at all times 
10,20,In any given profession the code of ethics communicates the shared principles and expected  behaviors of its members  In addition to providing members with guidance for decision making  a code of ethics may generate confidence among not only members of the profession but also  individuals who are not members of the profession such as clients prospective clients and or  the general public  The code of ethics informs and provides some assurance to the public that  the profession s members will use their specialized skills and knowledge in service of others

2,21,Some codes will be enhanced and clarified by the adoption of standards of conduct or specific  benchmarks of behavior required of members  These standards may be principle based or rule  based  The CFA Institute Code and Standards are an example of principle based standards  they  are based on the shared principles of honesty integrity transparency diligence and placing  client interests first  Rule based standards are often narrowly defined applying to specific  groups of individuals in specific circumstances  Principle based standards such as those of  CFA Institute apply to all candidates and members at all times regardless of title position  occupation geographic location or specific situation 
3,21,As a CFA Program candidate you are expected to act in accordance with the ethical and  professional competency responsibilities of the investment profession as expressed in the Code  and Standards  The Code and Standards are designed to foster and reinforce a culture of  responsibility and professionalism  The Code and Standards apply to all your professional  activities including but not limited to trading securities for yourself and or others providing  investment advice conducting research and performing other investment services

2,22,Solution to   
3,22,C is correct  A profession s code of ethics publicly communicates the shared principles  and expected behaviors of a profession s members  The existence of a code of ethics  does not ensure that all members will behave in a manner consistent with the code and  act ethically at all times  A profession will often establish a disciplinary process to  address alleged violations of the code of ethics  A profession may adopt standards of  conduct to enhance and clarify the code of ethics 
4,22,   CHALLENGES TO ETHICAL CONDUCT
5,22,Professionals generally aim to be responsible and to adhere to high moral standards so what is  the benefit of studying ethics  Throughout our careers we may find ourselves in difficult or at  least unfamiliar situations in which an appropriate course of action is not immediately clear  and or there may be more than one seemingly acceptable choice  studying ethics helps us  prepare for such situations  This section addresses challenges to engaging in ethical conduct   Failure to acknowledge understand or consider these challenges can lead to poor decision  making resulting in unintentional consequences such as unethical conduct and potential  violations of the Code and Standards 
6,22,Several challenges can make adherence to ethical conduct difficult  First people tend to believe  that they are ethical people and that their ethical standards are higher than average  Of course  everyone cannot be above average  However surveys show this belief in above averageness  remains  As reported in A Crisis of Culture        for example     of surveyed financial  services executives rated their firm s reputation for ethical conduct better than the rest of the  industry   Among those surveyed     rated the industry s reputation for ethical conduct as  positive  In contrast a survey of global consumer sentiment conducted the same year revealed  that only     of consumers surveyed trusted financial service providers to do the right thing   In fact financial services was the least trusted of all industries included in the survey 
7,22,These survey results illustrate overconfidence a common behavioral bias that can lead to faulty  decision making  Studies have shown that our beliefs and emotions frequently interfere with our  cognitive reasoning and result in behavioral bias a tendency to behave in a way that is not  strictly rational   As a result of the overconfidence bias we are more likely to overestimate the  morality of our own behavior particularly in situations that we have not faced before  The  overconfidence bias can result in a failure to consider explicitly or implicitly important inputs  and variables needed to form the best decision from an ethical perspective  In general the  overconfidence bias leads us to place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic  motivations such as  I m honest and would not lie  even though studies have shown that  internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave  ethically in a given situation

2,23,A second challenge is that decision makers often fail to recognize and or significantly  underestimate the effect of situational influences such as what other people around them are  doing  Situational influences are external factors such as environmental or cultural elements  that shape our thinking decision making and behavior  Social psychologists have studied how  much situational influences affect our behavior and have found that even good people with  honorable motives can and often will be influenced to do unethical things when put into  difficult situations   Experiments have shown that even people who consider themselves strong  independent free thinkers will conform to social pressures in many situations   The bystander  effect for example demonstrates that people are less likely to intervene in an emergency when  others are present  Fortunately experiments have also shown that situational influences can  induce people to act more ethically  For example people tend to behave more ethically when  they think someone else is watching or when there is a mirror placed close to them   The  important concept to understand is that situational influences have a very powerful and often  unrecognized effect on our thinking and behavior  Thus learning to recognize situational  influences is critical to making good decisions 
3,23,Common situational influences in the investment industry that can shape thinking and behavior  include money and prestige  One experiment found that simply mentioning money can reduce  ethical behavior  In the experiment participants were less likely to cooperate when playing a  game if the game was called the Wall Street Game rather than the Community Game   In the  investment industry large financial rewards including individual salaries bonuses and or  investment gains can induce honest and well intentioned individuals to act in ways that others  might not consider ethical  Large financial rewards and or prestige can motivate individuals to  act in their own short term self interests ignoring possible short term risks or consequences to  themselves and others as well as long term risks or consequences for both themselves and  others  Another extremely powerful situational influence is loyalty  Loyalty to supervisors or  organizations fellow employees and other colleagues can tempt individuals to make  compromises and take actions that they would reject under different situational influences or  judge harshly when taken by others 
4,23,Situational influences often blind people to other important considerations  Bonuses  promotions prestige and loyalty to employer and colleagues are examples of situational  influences that frequently have a disproportionate weight in our decision making  Our brains  more easily and quickly identify recognize and consider these short term situational influences  than longer term considerations such as a commitment to maintaining our integrity and  contributing to the integrity of the financial markets  Although absolutely important these long  term considerations often have less immediate consequences than situational influences making  them less obvious as factors to consider in a decision and therefore less likely to influence our  overall decision making  Situational influences shift our brain s focus from the long term to the  short or immediate term  When our decision making is too narrowly focused on short term  factors and or self interest we tend to ignore and or minimize the longer term risks and or costs  and consequences to ourselves and others and the likelihood of suffering ethical lapses and  making poor decisions increases

2,24,The story of Enron Corporation a US energy company illustrates the power of situational  influences  In the late     s with approximately       employees the company s culture  focused on increasing current revenues and the share price without regard for the long term  sustainability or consequences of such a culture  Management received significant stock  options which provided strong motivation to make decisions and take actions that would  increase the share price  The focus on share price was inescapable  employees were greeted by  the stock ticker in lobbies and elevators and on their computer screens  The focus on share price  overshadowed considerations about stakeholders and the long term sustainability of the  business and its profits  Under these situational influences some senior managers made poor  decisions and eventually succumbed to unethical conduct  They devised and adopted complex  accounting strategies that inflated revenues obscured the company s financial performance and  hid billions of dollars in debt  In October      the financial press revealed what Enron s  accounting practices had previously concealed  Shares of Enron which had reached a high of  US       in mid      fell to less than US   by the end of November       The company  which had claimed revenues of nearly US     billion in      secured a place in the record  books as one of the largest bankruptcies in US history  Dozens of former executives and  employees were investigated and many were charged with fraud and or conspiracy  Sixteen  individuals pled guilty including Chief Financial Officer  CFO  Andrew S  Fastow who pled  guilty to conspiracy forfeited nearly US    million in cash and property and was sentenced to  six years in prison  After a lengthy investigation and trial former Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey K  Skilling was convicted in May      of fraud conspiracy insider trading and making  false statements  He was sentenced to more than    years in prison a sentence that was  eventually reduced to    years   
3,24,Loyalty to employer and or colleagues is an extremely powerful situational influence  Our  colleagues can influence our thinking and behavior in both positive and negative ways  For  example colleagues may have encouraged you to signal your commitment to your career and  high ethical standards by enrolling in the CFA Program  If you work for or with people who are  not bound by the Code and Standards they might encourage you to take actions that are  consistent with local law unaware that the recommended conduct falls short of the Code and  Standards

2,25,Well intentioned firms may adopt or develop strong compliance programs to encourage  adherence to rules regulations and policies  A strong compliance policy is a good start to  developing an ethical culture but a focus on adherence to rules may not be sufficient  A  compliance approach may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture and can  oversimplify decision making  Taken to the extreme a strong compliance culture can become  another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations  In a firm  focused primarily on compliance employees may adopt a  check the box  mentality rather than  an ethical decision making approach  Employees may ask the question  What can I do   rather  than  What should I do   At Enron for example in compliance with procedures CFO Fastow  dutifully disclosed that he was the owner of several partnerships planning to transact business  with Enron  With powerful situational influences at work Fastow and board members focused  on  What can I do   rather than  What should I do   Compliance required that Fastow make  the ownership disclosures and request approval for the proposed business transactions from  Enron s board of directors which he did  Board members seemed to focus on the compliance  requirements to provide board approval of the proposed transactions rather than considering  their obligations to shareholders  In so doing they neglected to view the issue from a broader  perspective and consider  What should we do   Consequently they failed to recognize that the  proposed transactions placed Fastow s interests in direct conflict with those of his employer and  its shareholders  By focusing on the compliance requirements to provide board approval board  members failed to prevent Fastow from engaging in activity that enriched himself at the  expense of his employer and its shareholders  The Enron case illustrates both the power of  situational influences and the limitations of a compliance approach which can contribute to  overconfidence and is insufficient for ensuring ethical decision making

2,26,Solution to   
3,26,C is correct  Social psychologists have shown that even good people may behave  unethically in difficult situations  Situational influences which are external factors  e g   environmental or cultural elements  can shape our thinking decision making and  behavior and are more likely to lead to unethical behavior than internal traits or  character 
4,26,Solution to   
5,26,C is correct  Situational influences can motivate individuals to act in their short term  self interests without recognizing the long term risks or consequences for themselves  and others  Large financial rewards are powerful situational influences but in some  situations other situational influences such as loyalty to colleagues may be even more  powerful 
6,26,   THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT IN  THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY
7,26,Why are high ethical standards so important for the investment industry and investment  professionals  As the global financial crisis of      demonstrated isolated and seemingly  unimportant individual decisions such as approving loans to individuals unable to provide  proof of stable income in aggregate can precipitate a market crisis that can lead to economic  difficulties and job losses for millions of individuals  In an interconnected global economy and  marketplace each market participant must strive to understand how his or her decisions and  actions and the products and services he or she provides may affect others not just in the short  term but also the long term 
8,26,The investment industry serves society by matching those who supply capital or money with  those who seek capital to finance or fund their activities  For simplicity let us refer to those  who supply capital as investors and those who seek capital as borrowers  Borrowers may seek  capital to achieve long term goals such as building or upgrading factories schools bridges  highways airports railroads or other facilities  They may also seek short term capital to fund  short term goals and or support their daily operations  Borrowers seeking capital to meet short   and long term objectives include sovereign entities businesses schools hospitals companies  and other organizations that serve others  Some borrowers will turn to banks or other lending  institutions to finance their activities  others will turn to the financial markets to access the  funds they need to achieve their goals

2,27,In exchange for supplying capital to fund the borrowers  endeavors investors expect that their  investments will generate returns that compensate them for the use of their funds and the risks  involved  Before providing capital diligent and disciplined investors will evaluate the risks and  rewards of providing the capital  Some risks such as a downturn in the economy or a new  competitor could adversely affect the returns expected from the investment  To help evaluate  the potential risks and rewards of the investment investors conduct research reading and  evaluating the borrower s financial statements management s business plan research reports  industry reports and competitive analyses  Responsible investors will not invest their capital  unless they trust that their capital will be used in the way that has been described and is likely to  generate the returns they desire  Investors and society benefit when capital flows to borrowers  that can create the most value from the capital through their products and services 
3,27,Capital flows more efficiently between investors and borrowers when financial market  participants are confident that all parties will behave ethically  Ethical behavior builds and  fosters trust which has benefits for individuals firms the financial markets and society  When  people believe that a person or institution is reliable and acts in accordance with their  expectations they are more willing to take risks involving those people and institutions  For  example when people trust their financial advisers institutions and the financial markets they  are more likely to invest their money and accept the risk of short term price fluctuations  because they can reasonably believe that their investments will provide them with long term  benefits  Entrepreneurs are more likely to accept the risk of expanding their businesses and  hiring additional employees if they believe they will be able to attract investors with the funds  needed to expand at a reasonable cost  The higher the level of trust in the financial system the  more people are willing to participate in the financial markets  Broad participation in the  financial markets enables the flow of capital to fund the growth in goods services and  infrastructure that benefits society with new and often better hospitals bridges products  services and jobs  Broad participation in the financial markets also means that the need and  demand for investment professionals increase resulting in more job opportunities for those  seeking to use their specialized skills and knowledge of the financial markets in service to  others 
4,27,Ethics always matter but ethics are of particular importance in the investment industry because  the investment industry and financial markets are built on trust  Trust is important to all  business yet it is especially important in the investment industry for several reasons including  the nature of the client relationship differences in knowledge and access to information and the  nature of investment products and services 
5,27,In the client relationship investors entrust their assets to financial firms for care and  safekeeping  By doing so clients charge the firm and its employees with a special  responsibility  they are putting their faith and trust in the firm and its employees to protect their  assets  If the firm and its employees fail to protect clients  assets it could have severe  consequences for those clients  Without trust in that protection the firm and its employees  would not have any business 
6,27,Those who work in the investment industry as well as those who work in other professions  have specialized knowledge and sometimes better access to information  Having specialized  knowledge and better access to information is an advantage in any relationship giving one  party more power than the other  Investors trust that the professionals they hire will not use  their knowledge to take advantage of them  They rely on the investment professional to use his  or her specialized knowledge to serve or benefit their clients  interests

2,28,Another reason why trust is so important in the investment industry has to do with the nature of  its products and services  In other industries such as the transportation industry the  technology industry the retail industry or the food industry companies produce products  and or provide services that are tangible and or clearly visible  We can hold an electronic tablet  in our hands and inspect it  We can use software programs shop at retailers dine at restaurant  chains and watch films  We can judge the quality of the product or service based on a variety of  factors  How well does it perform its intended function  How efficient is it  How durable is it   How appealing is it  Is the price reasonable or appropriate for the product or service 
3,28,In the investment industry many investments are intangible and appear only as numbers on a  page or a screen  Investors cannot hold inspect or test their intended purchases as they can a  smartphone or a television set each of which often come with warranties should they fail to  function as advertised  Without tangible products to inspect and with no warranties for  protection should the product or service fail to perform as expected investors must rely on the  information provided about the investment both before and after purchase  When they call  their financial adviser and ask to see their investments they receive either an electronic or  printed statement with a list of holdings  They trust that the information is accurate and  complete a fair representation just as they trust that the investment professionals with whom  they are dealing will protect their interests  The globalization of finance also means that  investment professionals are likely to have business opportunities in new or unfamiliar places   Without trust financial transactions including global transactions are less likely to occur 
4,28,Because of these factors trust is the very foundation of the financial markets  This trust is built  fostered and maintained by the ethical actions of all the individuals who work and or  participate in the markets including those who work for companies banks investment firms  sovereign entities rating agencies accounting firms financial advisers and planners and  institutional and retail investors  When market participants act ethically investors and others  can trust that the numbers on the screen or the page are accurate representations and be  confident that investing and participating in the financial markets is worthwhile 
5,28,Ethical behavior by all market participants can lead to broader participation in the markets  protection of clients  interests and more opportunities for investment professionals and their  firms  Ethical behavior by firms can lead to higher levels of success and profitability for the  firms as well as their employees  Clients are attracted to firms with trustworthy reputations  leading to more business higher revenues and more profits  Ethical firms may also enjoy lower  relative costs than unethical firms because regulators are less likely to have cause to initiate  costly investigations or impose significant fines on firms in which high ethical standards are the  norm 
6,28,Conversely unethical behavior erodes and can even destroy trust  When clients and investors  suspect that they are not receiving accurate information or that the market is not a level playing  field they lose trust  Investors with low trust are less willing to accept risks  They may demand  a higher return for the use of their capital choose to invest elsewhere or choose not to invest at  all  Any of these actions would increase costs for borrowers seeking capital to finance their  activities  Without access to capital borrowers may not be able to meet their goals of building  new factories bridges or hospitals  Decreases in investments can harm society by reducing  jobs growth and innovation  Unethical behavior ultimately harms not only clients but also the  firm its employees and others

2,29,Diminished trust in financial markets can reduce growth in the investment industry and tarnish  the reputation of firms and individuals in the industry even if they did not participate in the  unethical behavior  Unethical behavior interferes with the ability of markets to channel capital  to the borrowers that can create the most value from the capital contributing to economic  growth  Both markets and society suffer when unethical behavior destroys trust in financial  markets  For you personally unethical behavior can cost you your job reputation and  professional stature and can lead to monetary penalties and possibly time in jail

4,29,The Importance of Ethical Conduct in the  Investment Industry
5,29,Which of the following statements is most accurate  Investment professionals have a  special responsibility to act ethically because 
6,29,A  the industry is heavily regulated 
7,29,B  they are entrusted to protect clients  assets 
8,29,C  the profession requires compliance with its code of ethics 
9,29,Solution 
10,29,B is correct  Investment professionals have a special responsibility because clients  entrust them to protect the clients  assets 
11,29,   ETHICAL VS  LEGAL STANDARDS
12,29,Many times stakeholders have common ethical expectations  Other times different  stakeholders will have different perceptions and perspectives and use different criteria to decide  whether something is beneficial and or ethical

2,30,Laws and regulations often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for society or  specific groups of stakeholders  For example some laws and regulations require businesses and  their representatives to tell the truth  They require specific written disclosures in marketing and  other materials  Complying with such rules is considered an ethical action  it creates a more  satisfactory outcome that conforms to stakeholders  ethical expectations  As an example  consider disclosure requirements mandated by securities regulators regarding the risks of  investing  Complying with such rules creates better outcomes for you your clients and your  employer  First compliance with the rule reduces the risk that clients will invest in securities  without understanding the risks involved which in turn reduces the risk that clients will file  complaints and or take legal action if their investments decline in value  Complying with the  rules also reduces the risk that regulators will initiate an investigation file charges or and  discipline or sanction you and or your employer  Any of these actions could jeopardize the  reputation and future prospects of you and your employer  Conduct that reduces these risks   e g  following disclosure rules  would be considered ethical  it leads to better outcomes for  you your clients and your employer and conforms to the ethical expectations of various  stakeholders 
3,30,Although laws frequently codify ethical actions legal and ethical conduct are not always the  same  Think about the diagram in Exhibit    Many types of conduct are both legal and ethical  but some conduct may be one and not the other  Some legal behaviors or activities may be  considered unethical and some behaviors or activities considered ethical may be deemed illegal  in certain jurisdictions  Acts of civil disobedience such as peaceful protests may be in response  to laws that individuals consider unethical  The act of civil disobedience may itself be  considered ethical and yet it violates existing local laws 
4,30,The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but considered by some to  be unethical  Some countries for example do not have laws prohibiting trading while in  possession of material nonpublic information but many investment professionals and CFA  Institute consider such trading unethical 
5,30,Another area in which ethics and laws may conflict is the area of  whistleblowing    Whistleblowing refers to the disclosure by an individual of dishonest corrupt or illegal activity  by an organization or government  Depending on the circumstances a whistleblower may  violate organizational policies and even local laws with the disclosure  thus a whistleblower s  actions may be deemed illegal and yet considered by some to be ethical

2,31,Exhibit    Types of Conduct
3,31,Some people advocate that increased regulation and monitoring of the behavior of participants  in the investment industry will increase trust in the financial markets  Although this approach  may work in some circumstances the law is not always the best mechanism to reduce unethical  behavior for several reasons  First laws typically follow market practices  regulators may  proactively design laws and regulations to address existing or anticipated practices that may  adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of markets or reactively design laws and regulations  in response to a crisis or an event that resulted in significant monetary losses and loss of  confidence trust in the financial system  Regulators  responses typically take significant time  during which the problematic practice may continue or even grow  Once enacted a new law  may be vague conflicting and or too narrow in scope  A new law may reduce or even eliminate  the existing activity while simultaneously creating an opportunity for a different but similarly  problematic activity  Additionally laws vary across countries or jurisdictions allowing  questionable practices to move to places that lack laws relevant to the questionable practice   Laws are also subject to interpretation and compliance by market participants who may choose  to interpret the law in the most advantageous way possible or delay compliance until a later  date  For these reasons laws and regulations are insufficient to ensure the ethical behavior of  investment professionals and market participants 
4,31,Ethical conduct goes beyond what is legally required and encompasses what different societal  groups or communities including professional associations consider to be ethically correct  behavior  To act ethically individuals need to be able to think through the facts of the situation  and make good choices even in the absence of clear laws or rules  In many cases there is no  simple algorithm or formula that will always lead to an ethical course of action  Ethics requires  judgment the ability to make considered decisions and reach sensible conclusions  Good  ethical judgment requires actively considering the interests of stakeholders and trying to benefit  multiple stakeholders clients family colleagues employers market participants and so  forth and minimize risks including reputational risk

7,32,C  Legal standards represent the highest standard 
8,32,   Which of the following statements is most accurate 
9,32,A  Increased regulations are the most useful means to reduce unethical  behavior by market participants 
10,32,B  Regulators quickly design and implement laws and regulations to address  practices that adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of markets 
11,32,C  New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the  markets can create opportunities for different but similarly problematic  conduct 
12,32,Solution to   
13,32,B is correct  Some ethical behavior may be illegal  Civil disobedience is an example of  what may be illegal behavior that some consider to be ethical  Legal and ethical  behavior often coincide but not always  Standards of conduct based on ethical principles  may represent a higher standard of behavior than the behavior required by law 
14,32,Solution to   
15,32,C is correct  New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the  markets can create opportunities for different but similarly problematic conduct

2,33,   ETHICAL DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORKS
3,33,Laws regulations professional standards and codes of ethics can guide ethical behavior but  individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and engaging in  appropriate conduct  One strategy to increase trust in the investment industry is to increase the  ability and motivation of market participants to act ethically and help them minimize the  likelihood of unethical actions  By integrating ethics into the decision making activities of  employees firms can enhance the ability and the motivation of employees to act ethically  thereby reducing the likelihood of unethical actions  The ability to relate an ethical decision  making framework to a firm s or profession s code of ethics allows investment professionals to  bring the principles of the code of ethics to life  An investment professional s natural desire to   do the right thing  can be reinforced by building a culture of integrity in the workplace   Development maintenance and demonstration of a strong culture of integrity within the firm  by senior management may be the single most important factor in promoting ethical behavior  among the firm s employees 
4,33,Adopting a code that clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought processes and  conduct the firm expects from its employees is a critical first step  But a code of ethics  although necessary is insufficient  Simply nurturing an inclination to do right is no match for  the multitude of daily decisions that investment professionals make  We need to exercise ethical  decision making skills to develop the muscle memory necessary for fundamentally ethical  people to make good decisions despite the reality of conflicts and our natural instinct for self  preservation  Just as coaching and practice transform our natural ability to run across a field into  the technique and endurance required to run a race teaching reinforcing and practicing ethical  decision making skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively  It is good for business  individuals firms the industry and the markets as well as society as a whole to engage in the  investment management profession in a highly ethical manner  A strong ethical culture that  helps honest ethical people engage in ethical behavior will foster the trust of investors lead to  robust global financial markets and ultimately benefit society  That is why ethics matter 
5,33,When faced with decisions that can affect multiple stakeholders investment professionals must  have a well developed set of principles  otherwise their thought processes can lead to at best  indecision and at worst fraudulent conduct and destruction of the public trust  Establishing an  ethical framework to guide your internal thought process regarding how to act is a crucial step  to engaging in ethical conduct  Investment professionals are generally comfortable analyzing  and making decisions from an economic  profit loss  perspective  Given the importance of  ethical behavior in carrying out professional responsibilities it is also important to analyze  decisions and their potential consequences from an ethical perspective  Using a framework for  ethical decision making will help investment professionals to effectively examine their choices  in the context of conflicting interests common to their professional obligations  e g  researching  and gathering information developing investment recommendations and managing money for  others   Such a framework will allow investment professionals to analyze and choose options in  a way that allows them to meet high standards of ethical behavior  An ethical decision making  framework provides investment professionals with a tool to help them adhere to a code of  ethics  By applying the framework and analyzing the particular circumstances of each available  alternative investment professionals are able to determine the best course of action to fulfill  their responsibilities in an ethical manner

2,34,An ethical decision making framework will help a decision maker see the situation from  multiple perspectives and pay attention to aspects of the situation that may be less evident with  a short term self focused perspective  The goal of getting a broader picture of a situation is to  be able to create a plan of action that is less likely to harm stakeholders and more likely to  benefit them  If a decision maker does not know or understand the effects of his or her actions  on stakeholders the likelihood of making a decision and taking action that harms stakeholders  is more likely to occur even if unintentionally  Finally an ethical decision making framework  helps decision makers justify their actions to a broader audience of stakeholders 
3,34,Ethical decision making frameworks are designed to facilitate the decision making process for  all decisions  They help people look at and evaluate a decision from multiple perspectives  enabling them to identify important issues they might not otherwise consider  Using an ethical  decision making framework consistently will help you develop sound judgment and decision  making skills and avoid making decisions that have unanticipated ethical consequences  Ethical  decision making frameworks come in many forms with varying degrees of detail  A general  ethical decision making framework is shown in Exhibit   
4,34,Exhibit    Ethical Decision Making Framework
5,34,  Identify  Relevant facts stakeholders and duties owed ethical principles  conflicts of interest
6,34,  Consider  Situational influences additional guidance alternative actions
7,34,  Decide and act
8,34,  Reflect  Was the outcome as anticipated  Why or why not 
9,34,The ethical decision making process includes multiple phases each of which has multiple  components  The process is often iterative and you the decision maker may move between  phases in an order different from what is presented  For simplicity we will discuss the phases  sequentially  In the initial phase you will want to identify the important facts that you have  available to you as well as information that you may not have but would like to have to give  yourself a more complete understanding of the situation  You will also want to identify the  stakeholders clients family colleagues your employer market participants and so  forth and the duties you have to each of them  You will then want to identify relevant ethical  principles and or legal requirements that might apply to the situation  You should also identify  any potential conflicts of interest inherent in the situation or conflicts in the duties you hold to  others  For example your duty to your client may conflict with your duty to your employer

2,35,In the second phase of ethical decision making you will take time to consider the situational  influences as well as personal behavioral biases that could affect your thinking and thus  decision making  These situational influences and biases could include a desire to please your  boss to be seen as successful by your peers and family to gain acceptance to earn a large  bonus and so on  During this phase you may seek additional guidance from trusted  sources perhaps a family member colleague or mentor who can help you think through the  situation and help you identify and evaluate alternative actions  You may turn to your  compliance department for assistance or you may even consult outside legal counsel  Seeking  additional guidance is a critical step in viewing the situation from different perspectives  You  should seek guidance from someone who is not affected by the same situational influences and  behavioral biases as you are and can therefore provide a fresh perspective  You should also  seek guidance from your firm s policies and procedures and the CFA Institute Code and  Standards  A helpful technique might be to imagine how an ethical peer or role model might act  in the situation 
3,35,The next phase of the framework is to make a decision and act  After you have acted on your  decision you should take the time to reflect on and assess your decision and its outcome  Was  the outcome what you anticipated  Why or why not  Had you properly identified all the  important facts stakeholders duties to stakeholders conflicts of interest and relevant ethical  principles  Had you considered the situational influences  Did you identify personal behavioral  biases that might affect your thinking  Had you sought sufficient guidance  Had you  considered and properly evaluated a variety of alternative actions  You may want to reflect on  the decision multiple times as the immediate and longer term consequences of your decision  and actions become apparent 
4,35,The process is often iterative  After identifying the relevant facts and considering situational  influences you may for example decide that you cannot make a decision without more  information  You may seek additional guidance on how to obtain the information you need   You may also begin considering alternative actions regarding how to proceed based on  expectations of what the additional information will reveal or you may wait until you have  more information reflect on what you have done and learned so far and start the process over  again  Sometimes cases can be complicated and multiple iterations may reveal that no totally  acceptable solution can be created  Applying an ethical decision making framework can help  you evaluate the situation so you can make the best possible decision  The next section shows  applications of the framework shown in Exhibit

11,38,  The firm s written policies
12,38,  A peer in my firm
13,38,  My supervisor the senior analyst
14,38,  The compliance department
15,38,  A mentor either at the firm or perhaps from university
16,38,  The CFA Institute Code and Standards

19,38,  Submitting the report as a draft and suggesting that contacts in  the industry might be able to provide more perspective
20,38,  Sending a survey to various technology industry veterans  soliciting their viewpoints on developments
21,38,After completing these steps you decide to check the firm s policies  Under a section  entitled  Research Analyst Role in Securities Offerings  the manual states  You may  not distribute any written  which include email fax electronic and other means   material related to companies and or their offerings       during the course of any offering  and the related quiet period

2,39,You read further and note a section entitled  Wall Crossing Policy and Procedures  that  states that  employees with confidential information may not communicate the  information to anyone who does not have a valid need to know  without first obtaining  clearance from the legal and compliance department 
3,39,You decide that your contacts do not have a  valid need to know  and that it is unlikely  the firm s legal and compliance professionals would approve sharing the information   You then decide to mention your contacts to the senior research analyst  He suggests  that they may have some useful perspective and that you might talk to them to hear their  perspective and cautions you not to disclose any information about any of the firm s  clients pending deals or research  You return to your desk delete the email and  following the senior research analyst s advice call your contacts on the telephone to  discuss the technology sector its prospects and its challenges  During the calls you  take care not to reveal any details about Big Tech Company or its offering 
4,39,Whatever action you take you should take time afterward to reflect on the decision and  the outcome  Was the outcome as anticipated  Why or why not 
5,39,The initial facts presented in the example are based on the real life experience of a young junior  analyst working on a highly anticipated IPO  The junior analyst may or may not have used an  ethical decision making framework to evaluate his situation  Without seeking additional  guidance the junior analyst sent an email similar to the one in the example with an attachment  that included confidential proprietary information including the senior analyst s analysis and  forecasts  Months later long after the IPO offering the junior analyst s email was discovered  by his employer  When questioned he admitted that he had received training regarding the  firm s policies and that he did not discuss or seek approval from anyone before sending the  email  Two days later the firm terminated the junior analyst s employment and reported to  regulatory authorities that he had been terminated for distributing written materials by email  during a securities offering in violation of firm policies that prohibit the dissemination of any  written materials during the course of a securities offering and related periods  The junior  analyst s supervisor also lost his job for failing to properly supervise the analyst  Multiple  regulators investigated the matter and the firm was fined millions of dollars for failing to  supervise its employees properly  The information regarding the junior analyst s termination  was posted and remains available on the regulator s website for all to see  Future employers  conducting routine background checks will know that the analyst was terminated for violating  firm policies relating to a securities offering 
6,39,The example presented is similar to situations faced by many analysts  Using an ethical  decision making framework will help you evaluate situations from multiple perspectives avoid  poor decision making and avoid the consequences that can result from taking an ill conceived  course of action  Using an ethical decision making framework is no guarantee of a positive  outcome but may help you avoid making unethical decisions

4,40,The financial adviser has added only a few new investors to the firm s funds but his  teammates have been very successful in their efforts  The end of the quarter is one week  away and his team is competing closely with another team for the bonus  One of his  teammates informs the financial adviser that he really needs the bonus so his elderly  mother can receive medical treatment

2,42,Solution to   
3,42,B is correct  Using an ethical decision making framework the financial adviser would  identify the relevant facts stakeholders duties owed and potential conflicts  In this  scenario the financial adviser owes a duty to his client as well as his employer  His  client s interests take precedence over all other interests  The bonus and his colleague s  desire to help his mother are situational influences  To navigate this situation the  financial adviser should seek additional information  he should research the risk and  return parameters and fee structures of other investments that can provide steady income  before making a recommendation to his client 
4,42,   CONCLUSION
5,42,This reading introduced ideas and concepts that will help you understand the importance of  ethical behavior in the investment industry as well as the challenges to adhering to high ethical  standards  A code of ethics will communicate an organization s values and the expected  behavior of its members as well as provide guidance for decision making  A code of ethics may  be further enhanced and clarified by the adoption of standards of conduct  An ethical decision  making framework combined with a code of ethics may help investment professionals analyze  their decisions in a way that identifies potential conflicts and negative consequences 
6,42,Knowing the rules to apply in a particular situation although important may not be sufficient to  ensure ethical conduct if used alone  Responsible professionals in the investment industry must  be able both to recognize areas that are prone to ethical pitfalls and to identify and process those  circumstances and influences that can impair judgment and lead to ethical lapses 
7,42,SUMMARY
8,42,  Ethics refers to the study of making good choices  Ethics encompasses a set of moral  principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behavior 
9,42,  Situational influences are external factors that may shape our behavior 
10,42,  Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in our own morality  underestimating the effect of situational influences and focusing on the immediate rather  than long term outcomes or consequences of a decision 
11,42,  In any given profession the code of ethics publicly communicates the established  principles and expected behavior of its members

2,43,  Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to serve others  they share  and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics to serve others and advance the  profession 
3,43,  A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of the profession will use  their specialized skills and knowledge to serve their clients and others 
4,43,  High ethical standards always matter and are of particular importance in the investment  industry which is based almost entirely on trust  Clients trust investment professionals to  use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client assets  All  stakeholders gain long term benefits when investment professionals adhere to high ethical  standards 
5,43,  Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for society or  specific groups of stakeholders 
6,43,  Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal standards but legal standards are  often created to address past ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving  and increasingly complex world 
7,43,  Legal standards are often rule based  Ethical conduct goes beyond legal standards  balancing self interest with the direct and indirect consequences of behavior on others 
8,43,  A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at and evaluate a decision  from different perspectives enabling them to identify important issues make wise  decisions and limit unintended consequences

3,44,A  Overconfidence
4,44,B  Loyalty to employer
5,44,C  Promise of money or prestige
6,44,   Situational influences in decision making will most likely be minimized if 
7,44,A  strong compliance programs are in place 
8,44,B  longer term consequences are considered 
9,44,C  individuals believe they are truthful and honest 
10,44,   Decision makers who use a compliance approach are most likely to 
11,44,A  avoid situational influences 
12,44,B  oversimplify decision making 
13,44,C  consider more factors than when using an ethical decision making approach 
14,44,   When unethical behavior erodes trust in an investment firm that firm is more likely to  experience 
15,44,A  lower revenues only 
16,44,B  higher expenses only 
17,44,C  lower revenues and higher expenses

20,44,B  Trading while in possession of material nonpublic information

2,45,   C is correct  Standards of conduct are applied to specific communities or societal groups  and identify specific behaviors required of community members  These standards of  conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community  members  Codes of ethics serve as a general guide for how community members should  act  they communicate the organization s values and overall expectations regarding  member behavior but they do not identify specific behaviors required of community  members  Laws and regulations are rules of conduct defined by governments and related  entities about obligatory and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and  entities under their jurisdiction 
3,45,   B is correct  A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from an  occupation or vocation such as specialized knowledge and skills service to others and a  code of ethics shared by its members  A profession is the ultimate evolution of an  occupation resulting from excellence in practice and expected adherence to a code of  ethics and standards of practice 
4,45,   A is correct  An overconfidence bias can lead individuals to put too much importance on  internal traits and intrinsic motivations such as their own perceptions of personal  honesty that can lead to faulty decision making  Loyalty to an employer and promise of  money or prestige are situational influences that can lead to faulty decision making 
5,45,   B is correct  Consciously considering long term consequences will help offset situational  influences  We more easily recognize and consider short term situational influences than  longer term considerations because longer term considerations have fewer immediate  consequences than situational influences do  When decision making is too narrowly  focused on short term factors we tend to ignore longer term risks and consequences and  the likelihood of poor ethical decision making increases  A strong compliance policy is a  good first step toward developing an ethical culture  a focus on rules adherence may not  be sufficient  Emphasis on compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider  the larger picture and can oversimplify decision making  Taken to the extreme a strong  compliance culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to  other important considerations  An overconfidence bias can place too much importance  on internal traits and intrinsic motivations such as  I m honest and would not lie  even  though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the main determinant of  whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation 
6,45,   B is correct  A compliance approach can oversimplify decision making and may not  encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture  A strong compliance culture  may be a good start in developing an ethical culture but can become another situational  influence that may result in employees failing to consider other important factors 
7,45,   C is correct  Unethical behavior ultimately harms investment firms  Clients are not  attracted if they suspect unethical behavior leading to less business and lower revenues   Investment firms may also experience higher relative costs because regulators are more  likely to have cause to initiate costly investigations 
8,45,   B is correct  The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but that  CFA Institute considers unethical  Trading while in possession of material nonpublic  information is not prohibited by law worldwide and can therefore be legal but CFA  Institute considers such trading unethical

2,46,   C is correct  Using an ethical decision making framework consistently will help you  develop sound judgment and decision making skills and avoid making decisions that  have unanticipated ethical consequences  The decision making process is often iterative  and the decision maker may move between phases of the framework  A decision maker  should consider more than confirmable facts and relationships  for example the decision  maker should consider situational influences and personal biases

11,47,PREFACE
12,47,The Standards of Practice Handbook  Handbook  provides guidance to the people who grapple  with real ethical dilemmas in the investment profession on a daily basis  the Handbook addresses the professional intersection where theory meets practice and where the concept of  ethical behavior crosses from the abstract to the concrete  The Handbook is intended for a  diverse and global audience  CFA Institute members navigating ambiguous ethical situations   supervisors and direct indirect reports determining the nature of their responsibilities to each  other to existing and potential clients and to the broader financial markets  and candidates  preparing for the Chartered Financial Analyst  CFA  examinations 
13,47,Recent events in the global financial markets have tested the ethical mettle of financial market  participants including CFA Institute members  The standards taught in the CFA Program and  by which CFA Institute members and candidates must abide represent timeless ethical  principles and professional conduct for all market conditions  Through adherence to these  standards which continue to serve as the model for ethical behavior in the investment  professional globally each market participant does his or her part to improve the integrity and  efficient operations of the financial markets

2,48,The Handbook provides guidance in understanding the interconnectedness of the aspirational  and practical principles and provisions of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional  Conduct  Code and Standards   The Code contains high level aspirational ethical principles that  drive members and candidates to create a positive and reputable investment profession  The  Standards contain practical ethical principles of conduct that members and candidates must  follow to achieve the broader industry expectations  However applying the principles  individually may not capture the complexity of ethical requirements related to the investment  industry  The Code and Standards should be viewed and interpreted as an interwoven tapestry  of ethical requirements  Through members  and candidates  adherence to these principles as a  whole the integrity of and trust in the capital markets are improved 
3,48,Evolution of the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards  of Professional Conduct
4,48,Generally changes to the Code and Standards over the years have been minor  CFA Institute  has revised the language of the Code and Standards and occasionally added a new standard to  address a prominent issue of the day  For instance in      CFA Institute added the standard  addressing performance presentation to the existing list of standards 
5,48,Major changes came in      with the ninth edition of the Handbook  CFA Institute adopted  new standards revised some existing standards and reorganized the standards  The revisions  were intended to clarify the requirements of the Code and Standards and effectively convey to  its global membership what constitutes  best practice  in a number of areas relating to the  investment profession 
6,48,The Code and Standards must be regularly reviewed and updated if they are to remain effective  and continue to represent the highest ethical standards in the global investment industry  CFA  Institute strongly believes that revisions of the Code and Standards are not undertaken for  cosmetic purposes but to add value by addressing legitimate concerns and improving  comprehension 
7,48,Changes to the Code and Standards have far reaching implications for the CFA Institute  membership the CFA Program and the investment industry as a whole  CFA Institute members  and candidates are required to adhere to the Code and Standards  In addition the Code and  Standards are increasingly being adopted in whole or in part by firms and regulatory  authorities  Their relevance goes well beyond CFA Institute members and candidates 
8,48,Standards of Practice Handbook
9,48,The periodic revisions of the Code and Standards have come in conjunction with updates of the  Standards of Practice Handbook  The Handbook is the fundamental element of the ethics  education effort of CFA Institute and the primary resource for guidance in interpreting and  implementing the Code and Standards  The Handbook seeks to educate members and  candidates on how to apply the Code and Standards to their professional lives and thereby  benefit their clients employers and the investing public in general  The Handbook explains the  purpose of the Code and Standards and how they apply in a variety of situations  The sections  discuss and amplify each standard and suggest procedures to prevent violations

2,49,Examples in the  Application of the Standard  sections are meant to illustrate how the standard  applies to hypothetical but factual situations  The names contained in the examples are fictional  and are not meant to refer to any actual person or entity  Unless otherwise stated  e g  one or  more people specifically identified  individuals in each example are CFA Institute members  and holders of the CFA designation  Because factual circumstances vary so widely and often  involve gray areas the explanatory material and examples are not intended to be all inclusive   Many examples set forth in the application sections involve standards that have legal  counterparts  members are strongly urged to discuss with their supervisors and legal and  compliance departments the content of the Code and Standards and the members  general  obligations under the Code and Standards 
3,49,CFA Institute recognizes that the presence of any set of ethical standards may create a false  sense of security unless the documents are fully understood enforced and made a meaningful  part of everyday professional activities  The Handbook is intended to provide a useful frame of  reference that suggests ethical professional behavior in the investment decision making process   This book cannot cover every contingency or circumstance however and it does not attempt to  do so  The development and interpretation of the Code and Standards are evolving processes   the Code and Standards will be subject to continuing refinement 
4,49,Summary of Changes in the Eleventh Edition
5,49,The comprehensive review of the Code and Standards in      resulted in principle  requirements that remain applicable today  The review carried out for the eleventh edition  focused on market practices that have evolved since the tenth edition  Along with updates to the  guidance and examples within the Handbook the eleventh edition includes an update to the  Code of Ethics that embraces the members  role of maintaining the social contract between the  industry and investors  Additionally there are three changes to the Standards of Professional  Conduct which recognize the importance of proper supervision clear communications with  clients and the expanding educational programs of CFA Institute 
6,49,Inclusion of Updated CFA Institute Mission
7,49,The CFA Institute Board of Governors approved an updated mission for the organization that is  included in the Preamble to the Code and Standards  The new mission conveys the  organization s conviction in the investment industry s role in the betterment of society at large 
8,49,Mission 
9,49,To lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of  ethics education and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society 
10,49,Updated Code of Ethics Principle
11,49,One of the bullets in the Code of Ethics was updated to reflect the role that the capital markets  have in the greater society  As members work to promote and maintain the integrity of the  markets their actions should also help maintain the social contract with investors

7,50,The standard for members and candidates with supervision or authority over others within their  firms was updated to bring about improvements in preventing illegal and unethical actions from  occurring  The prior version of Standard IV C  focused on the detection and prevention of  violations  The updated version stresses broader compliance expectations which include the  detection and prevention aspects of the original version

13,50,Given the constant development of new and exotic financial instruments and strategies the  standard regarding communicating with clients now includes an implicit requirement to discuss  the risks and limitations of recommendations being made to clients  The new principle and  related guidance take into account the fact that levels of disclosure will differ between products  and services  Members and candidates along with their firms must determine the specific  disclosures their clients should receive while ensuring appropriate transparency of the  individual firms  investment processes

2,51,Modification to Standard VII A 
3,51,Since this standard was developed CFA Institute has launched additional educational programs   The updated standard not only maintains the integrity of the CFA Program but also expands the  same ethical considerations when members or candidates participate in such programs as the  CIPM Program and the CFA Institute Investment Foundations certificate program  Whether  participating as a member assisting with the curriculum or an examination or as a sitting  candidate within a program we expect them to engage in these programs as they would  participate in the CFA Program

10,51,General Guidance and Example Revision
11,51,The guidance and examples were updated to reflect practices and scenarios applicable to  today s investment industry  Two concepts that appear frequently in the updates in this edition  relate to the increased use of social media for business communications and the use of and  reliance on the output of quantitative models  The use of social media platforms has increased  significantly since the publication of the tenth edition  And although financial modeling is not  new to the industry this update reflects upon actions that are viewed as possible contributing  factors to the financial crises of the past decade

2,52,CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program
3,52,All CFA Institute members and candidates enrolled in the CFA Program are required to comply  with the Code and Standards  The CFA Institute Board of Governors maintains oversight and  responsibility for the Professional Conduct Program  PCP  which in conjunction with the  Disciplinary Review Committee  DRC  is responsible for enforcement of the Code and  Standards  The DRC is a volunteer committee of CFA charterholders who serve on panels to  review conduct and partner with Professional Conduct staff to establish and review professional  conduct policies  The CFA Institute Bylaws and Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct   Rules of Procedure  form the basic structure for enforcing the Code and Standards  The  Professional Conduct division is also responsible for enforcing testing policies of other CFA  Institute education programs as well as the professional conduct of Certificate in Investment  Performance Measurement  CIPM  certificants 
4,52,Professional Conduct inquiries come from a number of sources  First members and candidates  must self disclose on the annual Professional Conduct Statement all matters that question their  professional conduct such as involvement in civil litigation or a criminal investigation or being  the subject of a written complaint  Second written complaints received by Professional Conduct  staff can bring about an investigation  Third CFA Institute staff may become aware of  questionable conduct by a member or candidate through the media regulatory notices or  another public source  Fourth candidate conduct is monitored by proctors who complete reports  on candidates suspected to have violated testing rules on exam day  Lastly CFA Institute may  also conduct analyses of scores and exam materials after the exam as well as monitor online  and social media to detect disclosure of confidential exam information

8,54,ETHICS AND THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY
9,54,Society ultimately benefits from efficient markets where capital can freely flow to the most  productive or innovative destination  Well functioning capital markets efficiently match those  needing capital with those seeking to invest their assets in revenue generating ventures  In order  for capital markets to be efficient investors must be able to trust that the markets are fair and  transparent and offer them the opportunity to be rewarded for the risk they choose to take   Laws regulations and enforcement play a vital role but are insufficient alone to guarantee fair  and transparent markets  The markets depend on an ethical foundation to guide participants   judgment and behavior  CFA Institute maintains and promotes the Code of Ethics and Standards  of Professional Conduct in order to create a culture of ethics for the ultimate benefit of society 
10,54,Why Ethics Matters
11,54,Ethics can be defined as a set of moral principles or rules of conduct that provide guidance for  our behavior when it affects others  Widely acknowledged fundamental ethical principles  include honesty fairness diligence and care and respect for others  Ethical conduct follows  those principles and balances self interest with both the direct and the indirect consequences of  that behavior for other people

2,55,Not only does unethical behavior by individuals have serious personal consequences ranging  from job loss and reputational damage to fines and even jail but unethical conduct from  market participants investment professionals and those who service investors can damage  investor trust and thereby impair the sustainability of the global capital markets as a whole   Unfortunately there seems to be an unending parade of stories bringing to light accounting  frauds and manipulations Ponzi schemes insider trading scandals and other misdeeds  Not  surprisingly this has led to erosion in public confidence in investment professionals  Empirical  evidence from numerous surveys documents the low standing in the eyes of the investing public  of banks and financial services firms the very institutions that are entrusted with the economic  well being and retirement security of society 
3,55,Governments and regulators have historically tried to combat misconduct in the industry  through regulatory reform with various levels of success  Global capital markets are highly  regulated to protect investors and other market participants  However compliance with  regulation alone is insufficient to fully earn investor trust  Individuals and firms must develop a   culture of integrity  that permeates all levels of operations and promotes the ethical principles  of stewardship of investor assets and working in the best interests of clients above and beyond  strict compliance with the law  A strong ethical culture that helps honest ethical people engage  in ethical behavior will foster the trust of investors lead to robust global capital markets and  ultimately benefit society  That is why ethics matters 
4,55,Ethics Society and the Capital Markets
5,55,CFA Institute recently added the concept  for the ultimate benefit of society  to its mission  The  premise is that we want to live in a socially politically and financially stable society that  fosters individual well being and welfare of the public  A key ingredient for this goal is global  capital markets that facilitate the efficient allocation of resources so that the available capital  finds its way to places where it most benefits that society  These investments are then used to  produce goods and services to fund innovation and jobs and to promote improvements in  standards of living  Indeed such a function serves the interests of the society  Efficient capital  markets in turn provide a host of benefits to those providing the investment capital  Investors  are provided the opportunity to transfer and transform risk because the capital markets serve as  an information exchange create investment products provide liquidity and limit transaction  costs 
6,55,However a well functioning and efficient capital market system is dependent on trust of the  participants  If investors believe that capital market participants investment professionals and  firms cannot be trusted with their financial assets or that the capital markets are unfair such  that only insiders can be successful they will be unlikely to invest or at the very least will  require a higher risk premium  Decreased investment capital can reduce innovation and job  creation and hurt the economy and society as a whole  Reduced trust in capital markets can also  result in a less vibrant if not smaller investment industry 
7,55,Ethics for a global investment industry should be universal and ultimately support trust and  integrity above acceptable local or regional customs and culture  Universal ethics for a global  industry strongly supports the efficiency values and mission of the industry as a whole   Different countries may be at different stages of development in establishing standards of  practice but the end goal must be to achieve rules regulations and standards that support and  promote fundamental ethical principles on a global basis

2,56,Capital Market Sustainability and the Actions of One
3,56,Individuals and firms also have to look at the indirect impacts of their actions on the broader  investment community  The increasingly interconnected nature of global finance brings to the  fore an added consideration of market sustainability that was perhaps less appreciated in years  past  In addition to committing to the highest levels of ethical behavior today s investment  professionals and their employers should consider the long term health of the market as a  whole 
4,56,As recent events have demonstrated apparently isolated and unrelated decisions however  innocuous when considered on an individual basis in aggregate can precipitate a market crisis   In an interconnected global economy and marketplace each participant should strive to be  aware of how his or her actions or the products he or she distributes may have an impact on  capital market participants in other regions or countries 
5,56,Investment professionals should consider how their investment decision making processes  affect the global financial markets in the broader context of how they apply their ethical and  professional obligations  Those in positions of authority have a special responsibility to  consider the broader context of market sustainability in their development and approval of  corporate policies particularly those involving risk management and product development  In  addition corporate compensation strategies should not encourage otherwise ethically sound  individuals to engage in unethical or questionable conduct for financial gain  Ethics  sustainability and properly functioning capital markets are components of the same concept of  protecting the best interests of all  To always place the interests of clients ahead of both  investment professionals  own interests and those of their employer remains a key ethos 
6,56,The Relationship between Ethics and Regulations
7,56,Some equate ethical behavior with legal behavior  If you are following the law you must be  acting appropriately  Ethical principles like laws and regulations prescribe appropriate  constraints on our natural tendency to pursue self interest that could harm the interests of  others  Laws and regulations often attempt to guide people toward ethical behavior but they do  not cover all unethical behavior  Ethical behavior is often distinguished from legal conduct by  describing legal behavior as what is required and ethical behavior as conduct that is morally  correct  Ethical principles go beyond that which is legally sufficient and encompass what is the  right thing to do 
8,56,Given many regulators  lack of sufficient resources to enforce well conceived rules and  regulations relying on a regulatory framework to lead the charge in establishing ethical  behavior has its challenges  Therefore reliance on compliance with laws and regulation alone is  insufficient to ensure ethical behavior of investment professionals or to create a truly ethical  culture in the industry 
9,56,The recent past has shown us that some individuals will succeed at circumventing the regulatory  rules for their personal gain  Only the application of strong ethical principles at both the  individual level and the firm level will limit abuses  Knowing the rules or regulations to apply  in a particular situation although important may not be sufficient to ensure ethical conduct   Individuals must be able both to recognize areas that are prone to ethical pitfalls and to identify  and process those circumstances and influences that can impair ethical judgment

2,57,Applying an Ethical Framework
3,57,Laws regulations professional standards and codes of ethics can guide ethical behavior but  individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and engaging in  appropriate conduct  When faced with an ethical dilemma individuals must have a well  developed set of principles  otherwise their thought processes can lead to at best equivocation  and indecision and at worst fraudulent conduct and destruction of the public trust  Establishing  an ethical framework for an internal thought process prior to deciding to act is a crucial step in  engaging in ethical conduct 
4,57,Most investment professionals are used to making decisions from a business  profit loss   outlook  But given the importance of ethical behavior in carrying out professional  responsibilities it is critical to also analyze decisions and potential conduct from an ethical  perspective  Utilizing a framework for ethical decision making will help investment  professionals effectively examine their conduct in the context of conflicting interests common  to their professional obligations  e g  researching and gathering information developing  investment recommendations and managing money for others   Such a framework will allow  investment professionals to analyze their conduct in a way that meets high standards of ethical  behavior 
5,57,An ethical decision making framework can come in many forms but should provide investment  professionals with a tool for following the principles of the firm s code of ethics  Through  analyzing the particular circumstances of each decision investment professionals are able to  determine the best course of action to fulfill their responsibilities in an ethical manner 
6,57,Commitment to Ethics by Firms
7,57,A firm s code of ethics risks becoming a largely ignored dusty compilation if it is not truly  integrated into the fabric of the business  The ability to relate an ethical decision making  framework to a firm s code of ethics allows investment professionals to bring the aspirations  and principles of the code of ethics to life transforming it from a compliance exercise to  something that is at the heart of a firm s culture 
8,57,An investment professional s natural desire to  do the right thing  must be reinforced by  building a culture of integrity in the workplace  Development maintenance and demonstration  of a strong culture of integrity within the firm by senior management may be the single most  important factor in promoting ethical behavior among the firm s employees  Adopting a code  that clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought processes and conduct the firm  expects from its employees is a critical first step  But a code of ethics while necessary is  insufficient 
9,57,Simply nurturing an inclination to do right is no match for the multitude of daily decisions that  investment managers make  We need to exercise ethical decision making skills to develop the  muscle memory necessary for fundamentally ethical people to make good decisions despite the  reality of agent conflicts  Just as coaching and practice transform our natural ability to run  across a field into the technique and endurance required to run a race teaching reinforcing and  practicing ethical decision making skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively  It is  good for business individuals firms the industry and the markets as well as society as a  whole to engage in the investment management profession in a highly ethical manner

2,58,Ethical Commitment of CFA Institute
3,58,An important goal of CFA Institute is to ensure that the organization and its members and  candidates develop promote and follow the highest ethical standards in the investment  industry  The CFA Institute Code of Ethics  Code  and Standards of Professional Conduct   Standards  are the foundation supporting the organization s quest to uphold the industry s  highest standards of individual and corporate practice and to help serve the greater good  The  Code is a set of principles that define the overarching conduct CFA Institute expects from its  members and CFA Program candidates  The Code works in tandem with the Standards which  outline professional conduct that constitutes fair and ethical business practices 
4,58,For more than    years CFA Institute members and candidates have been required to abide by  the organization s Code and Standards  Periodically CFA Institute has revised and updated its  Code and Standards to ensure that they remain relevant to the changing nature of the investment  profession and representative of the highest standard of professional conduct  Within this  Handbook CFA Institute addresses ethical principles for the profession including individual  professionalism  responsibilities to capital markets clients and employers  ethics involved in  investment analysis recommendations and actions  and possible conflicts of interest  Although  the investment world has become a far more complex place since the first publication of the  Standard of Practice Handbook distinguishing right from wrong remains the paramount  principle of the Code and Standards 
5,58,New challenges will continually arise for members and candidates in applying the Code and  Standards because many decisions are not unambiguously right or wrong  The dilemma exists  because the choice between right and wrong is not always clear  Even well intentioned  investment professionals can find themselves in circumstances that may tempt them to cut  corners  Situational influences can overpower the best of intentions 
6,58,CFA Institute has made a significant commitment to providing members and candidates with  the resources to extend and deepen their understanding of how to appropriately apply the  principles of the Code and Standards  The product offerings from CFA Institute offer a wealth  of material  Through publications conferences webcasts and podcasts the ethical challenges  of investment professionals are brought to light  Archived issues of these items are available on  the CFA Institute website  www cfainstitute org  
7,58,By reviewing these resources and discussing with their peers market participants can further  enhance their abilities to apply an effective ethical decision making framework  In time this  should help restore some of the trust recently lost by investors 
8,58,Markets function to an important extent on trust  Recent events have shown the fragility of this  foundation and the devastating consequences that can ensue when it is fundamentally  questioned  Investment professionals should remain mindful of the long term health of financial  markets and incorporate this concern for the market s sustainability in their investment decision  making  CFA Institute and the Standards of Practice Council hope this edition of the Handbook will assist and guide investment professionals in meeting the ethical demands of the highly  interconnected global capital markets for the ultimate benefit of society

5,65,  Participation in or Association with Violations by Others
6,65,  Investment Products and Applicable Laws
7,65,Members and candidates must understand the applicable laws and regulations of the countries  and jurisdictions where they engage in professional activities  These activities may include but  are not limited to trading of securities or other financial instruments providing investment  advice conducting research or performing other investment services  On the basis of their  reasonable and good faith understanding members and candidates must comply with the laws  and regulations that directly govern their professional activities and resulting outcomes and that  protect the interests of the clients 
8,65,When questions arise members and candidates should know their firm s policies and  procedures for accessing compliance guidance  This standard does not require members and  candidates to become experts however in compliance  Additionally members and candidates  are not required to have detailed knowledge of or be experts on all the laws that could  potentially govern their activities 
9,65,During times of changing regulations members and candidates must remain vigilant in  maintaining their knowledge of the requirements for their professional activities  New financial  products and processes along with uncovered ethical missteps create an environment for  recurring and potentially wide ranging regulatory changes  Members and candidates are also  continually provided improved and enhanced methods of communicating with both clients and  potential clients such as mobile applications and web based social networking platforms  As  new local regional and global requirements are updated to address these and other changes  members candidates and their firms must adjust their procedures and practices to remain in  compliance 
10,65,Relationship between the Code and Standards and Applicable Law
11,65,Some members or candidates may live work or provide investment services to clients living in  a country that has no law or regulation governing a particular action or that has laws or  regulations that differ from the requirements of the Code and Standards  When applicable law  and the Code and Standards require different conduct members and candidates must follow the  more strict of the applicable law or the Code and Standards 
12,65, Applicable law  is the law that governs the member s or candidate s conduct  Which law  applies will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case  The  more strict   law or regulation is the law or regulation that imposes greater restrictions on the action of the  member or candidate or calls for the member or candidate to exert a greater degree of action  that protects the interests of investors  For example applicable law or regulation may not  require members and candidates to disclose referral fees received from or paid to others for the  recommendation of investment products or services  Because the Code and Standards impose  this obligation however members and candidates must disclose the existence of such fees

2,66,Members and candidates must adhere to the following principles 
3,66,  Members and candidates must comply with applicable laws or regulations related to their  professional activities 
4,66,  Members and candidates must not engage in conduct that constitutes a violation of the  Code and Standards even though it may otherwise be legal 
5,66,  In the absence of any applicable law or regulation or when the Code and Standards  impose a higher degree of responsibility than applicable laws and regulations members  and candidates must adhere to the Code and Standards  Applications of these principles  are outlined in Exhibit   
6,66,The applicable laws governing the responsibilities of a member or candidate should be viewed  as the minimal threshold of acceptable actions  When members and candidates take actions that  exceed the minimal requirements they further support the conduct required of Standard I A  
7,66,CFA Institute members are obligated to abide by the CFA Institute Articles of Incorporation  Bylaws Code of Ethics Standards of Professional Conduct Rules of Procedure Membership  Agreement and other applicable rules promulgated by CFA Institute all as amended  periodically  CFA candidates who are not members must also abide by these documents  except  for the Membership Agreement  as well as rules and regulations related to the administration of  the CFA examination the Candidate Responsibility Statement and the Candidate Pledge 
8,66,Participation in or Association with Violations by Others
9,66,Members and candidates are responsible for violations in which they knowingly participate or  assist  Although members and candidates are presumed to have knowledge of all applicable  laws rules and regulations CFA Institute acknowledges that members may not recognize  violations if they are not aware of all the facts giving rise to the violations  Standard I A   applies when members and candidates know or should know that their conduct may contribute  to a violation of applicable laws rules or regulations or the Code and Standards 
10,66,If a member or candidate has reasonable grounds to believe that imminent or ongoing client or  employer activities are illegal or unethical the member or candidate must dissociate or  separate from the activity  In extreme cases dissociation may require a member or candidate to  leave his or her employment  Members and candidates may take the following intermediate  steps to dissociate from ethical violations of others when direct discussions with the person or  persons committing the violation are unsuccessful  The first step should be to attempt to stop  the behavior by bringing it to the attention of the employer through a supervisor or the firm s  compliance department  If this attempt is unsuccessful then members and candidates have a  responsibility to step away and dissociate from the activity  Dissociation practices will differ on  the basis of the member s or candidate s role in the investment industry  It may include  removing one s name from written reports or recommendations asking for a different  assignment or refusing to accept a new client or continue to advise a current client  Inaction  combined with continuing association with those involved in illegal or unethical conduct may  be construed as participation or assistance in the illegal or unethical conduct

2,67,CFA Institute strongly encourages members and candidates to report potential violations of the  Code and Standards committed by fellow members and candidates  Although a failure to report  is less likely to be construed as a violation than a failure to dissociate from unethical conduct  the impact of inactivity on the integrity of capital markets can be significant  Although the Code  and Standards do not compel members and candidates to report violations to their governmental  or regulatory organizations unless such disclosure is mandatory under applicable law  voluntary  reporting is often referred to as whistleblowing  such disclosure may be prudent under certain  circumstances  Members and candidates should consult their legal and compliance advisers for  guidance 
3,67,Additionally CFA Institute encourages members nonmembers clients and the investing public  to report violations of the Code and Standards by CFA Institute members or CFA candidates by  submitting a complaint in writing to the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program via e mail   pcprogram cfainstitute org  or the CFA Institute website  www cfainstitute org  
4,67,Investment Products and Applicable Laws
5,67,Members and candidates involved in creating or maintaining investment services or investment  products or packages of securities and or derivatives should be mindful of where these products  or packages will be sold as well as their places of origination  The applicable laws and  regulations of the countries or regions of origination and expected sale should be understood by  those responsible for the supervision of the services or creation and maintenance of the products  or packages  Members or candidates should make reasonable efforts to review whether  associated firms that are distributing products or services developed by their employing firm  also abide by the laws and regulations of the countries and regions of distribution  Members and  candidates should undertake the necessary due diligence when transacting cross border business  to understand the multiple applicable laws and regulations in order to protect the reputation of  their firm and themselves 
6,67,Given the complexity that can arise with business transactions in today s market there may be  some uncertainty surrounding which laws or regulations are considered applicable when  activities are being conducted in multiple jurisdictions  Members and candidates should seek  the appropriate guidance potentially including the firm s compliance or legal departments and  legal counsel outside the organization to gain a reasonable understanding of their  responsibilities and how to implement them appropriately 
7,67,Exhibit    Global Application of the Code and Standards
8,67,Members and candidates who practice in multiple jurisdictions may be subject to  varied securities laws and regulations  If applicable law is stricter than the  requirements of the Code and Standards members and candidates must adhere to  applicable law  otherwise they must adhere to the Code and Standards  The following  chart provides illustrations involving a member who may be subject to the securities  laws and regulations of three different types of countries

7,69,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
8,69,Members and Candidates
9,69,Suggested methods by which members and candidates can acquire and maintain understanding  of applicable laws rules and regulations include the following 
10,69,  Stay informed  Members and candidates should establish or encourage their employers to  establish a procedure by which employees are regularly informed about changes in  applicable laws rules regulations and case law  In many instances the employer s  compliance department or legal counsel can provide such information in the form of  memorandums distributed to employees in the organization  Also participation in an  internal or external continuing education program is a practical method of staying current 
11,69,  Review procedures  Members and candidates should review or encourage their  employers to review the firm s written compliance procedures on a regular basis to  ensure that the procedures reflect current law and provide adequate guidance to  employees about what is permissible conduct under the law and or the Code and  Standards  Recommended compliance procedures for specific items of the Code and  Standards are discussed in this Handbook in the  Guidance  sections associated with each  standard 
12,69,  Maintain current files  Members and candidates should maintain or encourage their  employers to maintain readily accessible current reference copies of applicable statutes  rules regulations and important cases

2,70,Distribution Area Laws
3,70,Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to understand the applicable  laws both country and regional for the countries and regions where their investment  products are developed and are most likely to be distributed to clients 
4,70,Legal Counsel
5,70,When in doubt about the appropriate action to undertake it is recommended that a member or  candidate seek the advice of compliance personnel or legal counsel concerning legal  requirements  If a potential violation is being committed by a fellow employee it may also be  prudent for the member or candidate to seek the advice of the firm s compliance department or  legal counsel 
6,70,Dissociation
7,70,When dissociating from an activity that violates the Code and Standards members and  candidates should document the violation and urge their firms to attempt to persuade the  perpetrator s  to cease such conduct  To dissociate from the conduct a member or candidate  may have to resign his or her employment 
8,70,Firms
9,70,The formality and complexity of compliance procedures for firms depend on the nature and size  of the organization and the nature of its investment operations  Members and candidates should  encourage their firms to consider the following policies and procedures to support the principles  of Standard I A  
10,70,  Develop and or adopt a code of ethics  The ethical culture of an organization starts at the  top  Members and candidates should encourage their supervisors or managers to adopt a  code of ethics  Adhering to a code of ethics facilitates solutions when people face ethical  dilemmas and can prevent the need for employees to resort to a  whistleblowing   solution publicly alleging concealed misconduct  CFA Institute has published the Asset  Manager Code of Professional Conduct which firms may adopt or use as the basis for  their codes  visit www cfainstitute org  
11,70,  Provide information on applicable laws  Pertinent information that highlights applicable  laws and regulations might be distributed to employees or made available in a central  location  Information sources might include primary information developed by the  relevant government governmental agencies regulatory organizations licensing  agencies and professional associations  e g  from their websites   law firm  memorandums or newsletters  and association memorandums or publications  e g  CFA  Institute Magazine

3,71,Example    Notification of Known Violations  
4,71,Michael Allen works for a brokerage firm and is responsible for an underwriting of securities  A  company official gives Allen information indicating that the financial statements Allen filed  with the regulator overstate the issuer s earnings  Allen seeks the advice of the brokerage firm s  general counsel who states that it would be difficult for the regulator to prove that Allen has  been involved in any wrongdoing 
5,71,Comment  Although it is recommended that members and candidates seek the  advice of legal counsel the reliance on such advice does not absolve a member or  candidate from the requirement to comply with the law or regulation  Allen should  report this situation to his supervisor seek an independent legal opinion and  determine whether the regulator should be notified of the error 
6,71,Example    Dissociating from a Violation  
7,71,Lawrence Brown s employer an investment banking firm is the principal underwriter for an  issue of convertible debentures by the Courtney Company  Brown discovers that the Courtney  Company has concealed severe third quarter losses in its foreign operations  The preliminary  prospectus has already been distributed 
8,71,Comment  Knowing that the preliminary prospectus is misleading Brown should  report his findings to the appropriate supervisory persons in his firm  If the matter  is not remedied and Brown s employer does not dissociate from the underwriting  Brown should sever all his connections with the underwriting  Brown should also  seek legal advice to determine whether additional reporting or other action should  be taken 
9,71,Example    Dissociating from a Violation  
10,71,Kamisha Washington s firm advertises its past performance record by showing the    year  return of a composite of its client accounts  Washington discovers however that the composite  omits the performance of accounts that have left the firm during the    year period whereas the  description of the composite indicates the inclusion of all firm accounts  This omission has led  to an inflated performance figure  Washington is asked to use promotional material that  includes the erroneous performance number when soliciting business for the firm 
11,71,Comment  Misrepresenting performance is a violation of the Code and Standards   Although she did not calculate the performance herself Washington would be  assisting in violating Standard I A  if she were to use the inflated performance  number when soliciting clients  She must dissociate herself from the activity  If  discussing the misleading number with the person responsible is not an option for  correcting the problem she can bring the situation to the attention of her supervisor  or the compliance department at her firm  If her firm is unwilling to recalculate  performance she must refrain from using the misleading promotional material and  should notify the firm of her reasons  If the firm insists that she use the material  she should consider whether her obligation to dissociate from the activity requires  her to seek other employment

2,72,Example    Following the Highest Requirements  
3,72,James Collins is an investment analyst for a major Wall Street brokerage firm  He works in a  developing country with a rapidly modernizing economy and a growing capital market  Local  securities laws are minimal in form and content and include no punitive prohibitions against  insider trading 
4,72,Comment  Collins must abide by the requirements of the Code and Standards  which might be more strict than the rules of the developing country  He should be  aware of the risks that a small market and the absence of a fairly regulated flow of  information to the market represent to his ability to obtain information and make  timely judgments  He should include this factor in formulating his advice to clients   In handling material nonpublic information that accidentally comes into his  possession he must follow Standard II A  Material Nonpublic Information 
5,72,Example    Following the Highest Requirements  
6,72,Laura Jameson works for a multinational investment adviser based in the United States   Jameson lives and works as a registered investment adviser in the tiny but wealthy island  nation of Karramba  Karramba s securities laws state that no investment adviser registered and  working in that country can participate in initial public offerings  IPOs  for the adviser s  personal account  Jameson believing that as a US citizen working for a US based company  she should comply only with US law has ignored this Karrambian law  In addition Jameson  believes that as a charterholder as long as she adheres to the Code and Standards requirement  that she disclose her participation in any IPO to her employer and clients when such ownership  creates a conflict of interest she is meeting the highest ethical requirements 
7,72,Comment  Jameson is in violation of Standard I A   As a registered investment  adviser in Karramba Jameson is prevented by Karrambian securities law from  participating in IPOs regardless of the law of her home country  In addition  because the law of the country where she is working is stricter than the Code and  Standards she must follow the stricter requirements of the local law rather than the  requirements of the Code and Standards 
8,72,Example    Laws and Regulations Based on Religious Tenets  
9,72,Amanda Janney is employed as a fixed income portfolio manager for a large international firm   She is on a team within her firm that is responsible for creating and managing a fixed income  hedge fund to be sold throughout the firm s distribution centers to high net worth clients  Her  firm receives expressions of interest from potential clients from the Middle East who are  seeking investments that comply with Islamic law  The marketing and promotional materials for  the fixed income hedge fund do not specify whether or not the fund is a suitable investment for  an investor seeking compliance with Islamic law  Because the fund is being distributed  globally Janney is concerned about the reputation of the fund and the firm and believes  disclosure of whether or not the fund complies with Islamic law could help minimize potential  mistakes with placing this investment

2,73,Comment  As the financial market continues to become globalized members and  candidates will need to be aware of the differences between cultural and religious  laws and requirements as well as the different governmental laws and regulations   Janney and the firm could be proactive in their efforts to acknowledge areas where  the new fund may not be suitable for clients 
3,73,Example    Reporting Potential Unethical Actions  
4,73,Krista Blume is a junior portfolio manager for high net worth portfolios at a large global  investment manager  She observes a number of new portfolios and relationships coming from a  country in Europe where the firm did not have previous business and is told that a broker in that  country is responsible for this new business  At a meeting on allocation of research resources to  third party research firms Blume notes that this broker has been added to the list and is  allocated payments for research  However she knows the portfolios do not invest in securities  in the broker s country and she has not seen any research come from this broker  Blume asks  her supervisor about the name being on the list and is told that someone in marketing is  receiving the research and that the name being on the list is OK  She believes that what may be  going on is that the broker is being paid for new business through the inappropriate research  payments and she wishes to dissociate from the misconduct 
5,73,Comment  Blume should follow the firm s policies and procedures for reporting  potential unethical activity which may include discussions with her supervisor or  someone in a designated compliance department  She should communicate her  concerns appropriately while advocating for disclosure between the new broker  relationship and the research payments 
6,73,Example    Failure to Maintain Knowledge of the Law  
7,73,Colleen White is excited to use new technology to communicate with clients and potential  clients  She recently began posting investment information including performance reports and  investment opinions and recommendations to her Facebook page  In addition she sends out  brief announcements opinions and thoughts via her Twitter account  for example  Prospects  for future growth of XYZ company look good   makingmoney U    Prior to White s use of  these social media platforms the local regulator had issued new requirements and guidance  governing online electronic communication  White s communications appear to conflict with  the recent regulatory announcements 
8,73,Comment  White is in violation of Standard I A  because her communications do  not comply with the existing guidance and regulation governing use of social  media  White must be aware of the evolving legal requirements pertaining to new  and dynamic areas of the financial services industry that are applicable to her  She  should seek guidance from appropriate knowledgeable and reliable sources such  as her firm s compliance department external service providers or outside counsel  unless she diligently follows legal and regulatory trends affecting her professional  responsibilities

14,74,Standard I B  states the responsibility of CFA Institute members and candidates in the CFA  Program to maintain independence and objectivity so that their clients will have the benefit of  their work and opinions unaffected by any potential conflict of interest or other circumstance  adversely affecting their judgment  Every member and candidate should endeavor to avoid  situations that could cause or be perceived to cause a loss of independence or objectivity in  recommending investments or taking investment action 
15,74,External sources may try to influence the investment process by offering analysts and portfolio  managers a variety of benefits  Corporations may seek expanded research coverage issuers and  underwriters may wish to promote new securities offerings brokers may want to increase  commission business and independent rating agencies may be influenced by the company  requesting the rating  Benefits may include gifts invitations to lavish functions tickets favors  or job referrals  One type of benefit is the allocation of shares in oversubscribed IPOs to  investment managers for their personal accounts  This practice affords managers the  opportunity to make quick profits that may not be available to their clients  Such a practice is  prohibited under Standard I B   Modest gifts and entertainment are acceptable but special care  must be taken by members and candidates to resist subtle and not so subtle pressures to act in  conflict with the interests of their clients  Best practice dictates that members and candidates  reject any offer of gift or entertainment that could be expected to threaten their independence  and objectivity

2,75,Receiving a gift benefit or consideration from a client can be distinguished from gifts given by  entities seeking to influence a member or candidate to the detriment of other clients  In a client  relationship the client has already entered some type of compensation arrangement with the  member candidate or his or her firm  A gift from a client could be considered supplementary  compensation  The potential for obtaining influence to the detriment of other clients although  present is not as great as in situations where no compensation arrangement exists  When  possible prior to accepting  bonuses  or gifts from clients members and candidates should  disclose to their employers such benefits offered by clients  If notification is not possible prior  to acceptance members and candidates must disclose to their employer benefits previously  accepted from clients  Disclosure allows the employer of a member or candidate to make an  independent determination about the extent to which the gift may affect the member s or  candidate s independence and objectivity 
3,75,Members and candidates may also come under pressure from their own firms to for example  issue favorable research reports or recommendations for certain companies with potential or  continuing business relationships with the firm  The situation may be aggravated if an executive  of the company sits on the bank or investment firm s board and attempts to interfere in  investment decision making  Members and candidates acting in a sales or marketing capacity  must be especially mindful of their objectivity in promoting appropriate investments for their  clients 
4,75,Left unmanaged pressures that threaten independence place research analysts in a difficult  position and may jeopardize their ability to act independently and objectively  One of the ways  that research analysts have coped with these pressures in the past is to use subtle and ambiguous  language in their recommendations or to temper the tone of their research reports  Such  subtleties are lost on some investors however who reasonably expect research reports and  recommendations to be straightforward and transparent and to communicate clearly an analyst s  views based on unbiased analysis and independent judgment 
5,75,Members and candidates are personally responsible for maintaining independence and  objectivity when preparing research reports making investment recommendations and taking  investment action on behalf of clients  Recommendations must convey the member s or  candidate s true opinions free of bias from internal or external pressures and be stated in clear  and unambiguous language 
6,75,Members and candidates also should be aware that some of their professional or social activities  within CFA Institute or its member societies may subtly threaten their independence or  objectivity  When seeking corporate financial support for conventions seminars or even  weekly society luncheons the members or candidates responsible for the activities should  evaluate both the actual effect of such solicitations on their independence and whether their  objectivity might be perceived to be compromised in the eyes of their clients

2,76,Buy Side Clients
3,76,One source of pressure on sell side analysts is buy side clients  Institutional clients are  traditionally the primary users of sell side research either directly or with soft dollar brokerage   Portfolio managers may have significant positions in the security of a company under review  A  rating downgrade may adversely affect the portfolio s performance particularly in the short  term because the sensitivity of stock prices to ratings changes has increased in recent years  A  downgrade may also affect the manager s compensation which is usually tied to portfolio  performance  Moreover portfolio performance is subject to media and public scrutiny which  may affect the manager s professional reputation  Consequently some portfolio managers  implicitly or explicitly support sell side ratings inflation 
4,76,Portfolio managers have a responsibility to respect and foster the intellectual honesty of sell  side research  Therefore it is improper for portfolio managers to threaten or engage in  retaliatory practices such as reporting sell side analysts to the covered company in order to  instigate negative corporate reactions  Although most portfolio managers do not engage in such  practices the perception by the research analyst that a reprisal is possible may cause concern  and make it difficult for the analyst to maintain independence and objectivity 
5,76,Fund Manager and Custodial Relationships
6,76,Research analysts are not the only people who must be concerned with maintaining their  independence  Members and candidates who are responsible for hiring and retaining outside  managers and third party custodians should not accepts gifts entertainment or travel funding  that may be perceived as impairing their decisions  The use of secondary fund managers has  evolved into a common practice to manage specific asset allocations  The use of third party  custodians is common practice for independent investment advisory firms and helps them with  trading capabilities and reporting requirements  Primary and secondary fund managers as well  as third party custodians often arrange educational and marketing events to inform others about  their business strategies investment process or custodial services  Members and candidates  must review the merits of each offer individually in determining whether they may attend yet  maintain their independence 
7,76,Investment Banking Relationships
8,76,Some sell side firms may exert pressure on their analysts to issue favorable research reports on  current or prospective investment banking clients  For many of these firms income from  investment banking has become increasingly important to overall firm profitability because  brokerage income has declined as a result of price competition  Consequently firms offering  investment banking services work hard to develop and maintain relationships with investment  banking clients and prospects  These companies are often covered by the firm s research  analysts because companies often select their investment banks on the basis of the reputation of  their research analysts the quality of their work and their standing in the industry

2,77,In some countries research analysts frequently work closely with their investment banking  colleagues to help evaluate prospective investment banking clients  In other countries because  of past abuses in managing the obvious conflicts of interest regulators have established clear  rules prohibiting the interaction of these groups  Although collaboration between research  analysts and investment banking colleagues may benefit the firm and enhance market efficiency   e g  by allowing firms to assess risks more accurately and make better pricing assumptions  it  requires firms to carefully balance the conflicts of interest inherent in the collaboration  Having  analysts work with investment bankers is appropriate only when the conflicts are adequately  and effectively managed and disclosed  Firm managers have a responsibility to provide an  environment in which analysts are neither coerced nor enticed into issuing research that does  not reflect their true opinions  Firms should require public disclosure of actual conflicts of  interest to investors 
3,77,Members candidates and their firms must adopt and follow perceived best practices in  maintaining independence and objectivity in the corporate culture and protecting analysts from  undue pressure by their investment banking colleagues  The  firewalls  traditionally built  between these two functions must be managed to minimize conflicts of interest  indeed  enhanced firewall policies may go as far as prohibiting all communications between these  groups  A key element of an enhanced firewall is separate reporting structures for personnel on  the research side and personnel on the investment banking side  For example investment  banking personnel should not have any authority to approve disapprove or make changes to  research reports or recommendations  Another element should be a compensation arrangement  that minimizes the pressures on research analysts and rewards objectivity and accuracy   Compensation arrangements should not link analyst remuneration directly to investment  banking assignments in which the analyst may participate as a team member  Firms should also  regularly review their policies and procedures to determine whether analysts are adequately  safeguarded and to improve the transparency of disclosures relating to conflicts of interest  The  highest level of transparency is achieved when disclosures are prominent and specific rather  than marginalized and generic 
4,77,Performance Measurement and Attribution
5,77,Members and candidates working within a firm s investment performance measurement  department may also be presented with situations that challenge their independence and  objectivity  As performance analysts their analyses may reveal instances where managers may  appear to have strayed from their mandate  Additionally the performance analyst may receive  requests to alter the construction of composite indexes owing to negative results for a selected  account or fund  The member or candidate must not allow internal or external influences to  affect their independence and objectivity as they faithfully complete their performance  calculation and analysis related responsibilities

2,78,Public Companies
3,78,Analysts may be pressured to issue favorable reports and recommendations by the companies  they follow  Not every stock is a  buy  and not every research report is favorable for many  reasons including the cyclical nature of many business activities and market fluctuations  For  instance a  good company  does not always translate into a  good stock  rating if the current  stock price is fully valued  In making an investment recommendation the analyst is responsible  for anticipating interpreting and assessing a company s prospects and stock price performance  in a factual manner  Many company managers however believe that their company s stock is  undervalued and these managers may find it difficult to accept critical research reports or  ratings downgrades  Company managers  compensation may also be dependent on stock  performance 
4,78,Due diligence in financial research and analysis involves gathering information from a wide  variety of sources including public disclosure documents  such as proxy statements annual  reports and other regulatory filings  and also company management and investor relations  personnel suppliers customers competitors and other relevant sources  Research analysts may  justifiably fear that companies will limit their ability to conduct thorough research by denying  analysts who have  negative  views direct access to company managers and or barring them  from conference calls and other communication venues  Retaliatory practices include  companies bringing legal action against analysts personally and or their firms to seek monetary  damages for the economic effects of negative reports and recommendations  Although few  companies engage in such behavior the perception that a reprisal is possible is a reasonable  concern for analysts  This concern may make it difficult for them to conduct the comprehensive  research needed to make objective recommendations  For further information and guidance  members and candidates should refer to the CFA Institute publication Best Practice Guidelines  Governing Analyst Corporate Issuer Relations  www cfainstitute org  
5,78,Credit Rating Agency Opinions
6,78,Credit rating agencies provide a service by grading the fixed income products offered by  companies  Analysts face challenges related to incentives and compensation schemes that may  be tied to the final rating and successful placement of the product  Members and candidates  employed at rating agencies should ensure that procedures and processes at the agencies prevent  undue influences from a sponsoring company during the analysis  Members and candidates  should abide by their agencies  and the industry s standards of conduct regarding the analytical  process and the distribution of their reports 
7,78,The work of credit rating agencies also raises concerns similar to those inherent in investment  banking relationships  Analysts may face pressure to issue ratings at a specific level because of  other services the agency offers companies namely advising on the development of structured  products  The rating agencies need to develop the necessary firewalls and protections to allow  the independent operations of their different business lines 
8,78,When using information provided by credit rating agencies members and candidates should be  mindful of the potential conflicts of interest  And because of the potential conflicts members  and candidates may need to independently validate the rating granted

2,79,Influence during the Manager Selection Procurement Process
3,79,Members and candidates may find themselves on either side of the manager selection process   An individual may be on the hiring side as a representative of a pension organization or an  investment committee member of an endowment or a charitable organization  Additionally  other members may be representing their organizations in attempts to earn new investment  allocation mandates  The responsibility of members and candidates to maintain their  independence and objectivity extends to the hiring or firing of those who provide business  services beyond investment management 
4,79,When serving in a hiring capacity members and candidates should not solicit gifts  contributions or other compensation that may affect their independence and objectivity   Solicitations do not have to benefit members and candidates personally to conflict with  Standard I B   Requesting contributions to a favorite charity or political organization may also  be perceived as an attempt to influence the decision making process  Additionally members  and candidates serving in a hiring capacity should refuse gifts donations and other offered  compensation that may be perceived to influence their decision making process 
5,79,When working to earn a new investment allocation members and candidates should not offer  gifts contributions or other compensation to influence the decision of the hiring representative   The offering of these items with the intent to impair the independence and objectivity of another  person would not comply with Standard I B   Such prohibited actions may include offering  donations to a charitable organization or political candidate referred by the hiring  representative 
6,79,A clear example of improperly influencing hiring representatives was displayed in the  pay to  play  scandal involving government sponsored pension funds in the United States  Managers  looking to gain lucrative allocations from the large funds made requested donations to the  political campaigns of individuals directly responsible for the hiring decisions  This scandal and  other similar events have led to new laws requiring additional reporting concerning political  contributions and bans on hiring or hiring delays for managers that made campaign  contributions to representatives associated with the decision making process 
7,79,Issuer Paid Research
8,79,In light of the recent reduction of sell side research coverage many companies seeking to  increase visibility both in the financial markets and with potential investors have hired analysts  to produce research reports analyzing their companies  These reports bridge the gap created by  the lack of coverage and can be an effective method of communicating with investors 
9,79,Issuer paid research conducted by independent analysts however is fraught with potential  conflicts  Depending on how the research is written and distributed investors may be misled  into believing that the research is from an independent source when in reality it has been paid  for by the subject company 
10,79,Members and candidates must adhere to strict standards of conduct that govern how the  research is to be conducted and what disclosures must be made in the report  Analysts must  engage in thorough independent and unbiased analysis and must fully disclose potential  conflicts of interest including the nature of their compensation  Otherwise analysts risk  misleading investors

2,80,Investors need clear credible and thorough information about companies and they need  research based on independent thought  At a minimum issuer paid research should include a  thorough analysis of the company s financial statements based on publicly disclosed  information benchmarking within a peer group and industry analysis  Analysts must exercise  diligence independence and thoroughness in conducting their research in an objective manner   Analysts must distinguish between fact and opinion in their reports  Conclusions must have a  reasonable and adequate basis and must be supported by appropriate research 
3,80,Independent analysts must also strictly limit the type of compensation that they accept for  conducting issuer paid research  Otherwise the content and conclusions of the reports could  reasonably be expected to be determined or affected by compensation from the sponsoring  companies  Compensation that might influence the research report could be direct such as  payment based on the conclusions of the report or indirect such as stock warrants or other  equity instruments that could increase in value on the basis of positive coverage in the report  In  such instances the independent analyst has an incentive to avoid including negative information  or making negative conclusions  Best practice is for independent analysts prior to writing their  reports to negotiate only a flat fee for their work that is not linked to their conclusions or  recommendations 
4,80,Travel Funding
5,80,The benefits related to accepting paid travel extend beyond the cost savings to the member or  candidate and his firm such as the chance to talk exclusively with the executives of a company  or learning more about the investment options provided by an investment organization   Acceptance also comes with potential concerns  for example members and candidates may be  influenced by these discussions when flying on a corporate or chartered jet or attending  sponsored conferences where many expenses including airfare and lodging are covered  To  avoid the appearance of compromising their independence and objectivity best practice dictates  that members and candidates always use commercial transportation at their expense or at the  expense of their firm rather than accept paid travel arrangements from an outside company   Should commercial transportation be unavailable members and candidates may accept  modestly arranged travel to participate in appropriate information gathering events such as a  property tour 
6,80,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
7,80,Members and candidates should adhere to the following practices and should encourage their  firms to establish procedures to avoid violations of Standard I B  
8,80,  Protect the integrity of opinions  Members candidates and their firms should establish  policies stating that every research report concerning the securities of a corporate client  should reflect the unbiased opinion of the analyst  Firms should also design compensation  systems that protect the integrity of the investment decision process by maintaining the  independence and objectivity of analysts 
9,80,  Create a restricted list  If the firm is unwilling to permit dissemination of adverse  opinions about a corporate client members and candidates should encourage the firm to  remove the controversial company from the research universe and put it on a restricted  list so that the firm disseminates only factual information about the company

2,81,  Restrict special cost arrangements  When attending meetings at an issuer s headquarters  members and candidates should pay for commercial transportation and hotel charges  No  corporate issuer should reimburse members or candidates for air transportation  Members  and candidates should encourage issuers to limit the use of corporate aircraft to situations  in which commercial transportation is not available or in which efficient movement could  not otherwise be arranged  Members and candidates should take particular care that when  frequent meetings are held between an individual issuer and an individual member or  candidate the issuer should not always host the member or candidate 
3,81,  Limit gifts  Members and candidates must limit the acceptance of gratuities and or gifts to  token items  Standard I B  does not preclude customary ordinary business related  entertainment as long as its purpose is not to influence or reward members or candidates   Firms should consider a strict value limit for acceptable gifts that is based on the local or  regional customs and should address whether the limit is per gift or an aggregate annual  value 
4,81,  Restrict investments  Members and candidates should encourage their investment firms to  develop formal policies related to employee purchases of equity or equity related IPOs   Firms should require prior approval for employee participation in IPOs with prompt  disclosure of investment actions taken following the offering  Strict limits should be  imposed on investment personnel acquiring securities in private placements 
5,81,  Review procedures  Members and candidates should encourage their firms to implement  effective supervisory and review procedures to ensure that analysts and portfolio  managers comply with policies relating to their personal investment activities 
6,81,  Independence policy  Members candidates and their firms should establish a formal  written policy on the independence and objectivity of research and implement reporting  structures and review procedures to ensure that research analysts do not report to and are  not supervised or controlled by any department of the firm that could compromise the  independence of the analyst  More detailed recommendations related to a firm s policies  regarding research objectivity are set forth in the CFA Institute statement Research  Objectivity Standards  www cfainstitute org  
7,81,  Appointed officer  Firms should appoint a senior officer with oversight responsibilities for  compliance with the firm s code of ethics and all regulations concerning its business   Firms should provide every employee with the procedures and policies for reporting  potentially unethical behavior violations of regulations or other activities that may harm  the firm s reputation

2,82,Example    Travel Expenses  
3,82,Steven Taylor a mining analyst with Bronson Brokers is invited by Precision Metals to join a  group of his peers in a tour of mining facilities in several western US states  The company  arranges for chartered group flights from site to site and for accommodations in Spartan Motels  the only chain with accommodations near the mines for three nights  Taylor allows Precision  Metals to pick up his tab as do the other analysts with one exception John Adams an  employee of a large trust company who insists on following his company s policy and paying  for his hotel room himself 
4,82,Comment  The policy of the company where Adams works complies closely with  Standard I B  by avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest but Taylor  and the other analysts were not necessarily violating Standard I B   In general  when allowing companies to pay for travel and or accommodations in these  circumstances members and candidates must use their judgment  They must be on  guard that such arrangements not impinge on a member s or candidate s  independence and objectivity  In this example the trip was strictly for business and  Taylor was not accepting irrelevant or lavish hospitality  The itinerary required  chartered flights for which analysts were not expected to pay  The  accommodations were modest  These arrangements are not unusual and did not  violate Standard I B  as long as Taylor s independence and objectivity were not  compromised  In the final analysis members and candidates should consider both  whether they can remain objective and whether their integrity might be perceived  by their clients to have been compromised

2,83,Comment  Fritz s analysis of Metals   Mining must be objective and based solely  on consideration of company fundamentals  Any pressure from other divisions of  his firm is inappropriate  This conflict could have been eliminated if in anticipation  of the offering Hilton Brokerage had placed Metals   Mining on a restricted list  for its sales force 
3,83,Example    Research Independence and Issuer Relationship Pressure  
4,83,As in Example   Walter Fritz has concluded that Metals   Mining stock is overvalued at its  current level but he is concerned that a negative research report might jeopardize a close  rapport that he has nurtured over the years with Metals   Mining s CEO chief finance officer  and investment relations officer  Fritz is concerned that a negative report might result also in  management retaliation for instance cutting him off from participating in conference calls  when a quarterly earnings release is made denying him the ability to ask questions on such  calls and or denying him access to top management for arranging group meetings between  Hilton Brokerage clients and top Metals   Mining managers 
5,83,Comment  As in Example   Fritz s analysis must be objective and based solely on  consideration of company fundamentals  Any pressure from Metals   Mining is  inappropriate  Fritz should reinforce the integrity of his conclusions by stressing  that his investment recommendation is based on relative valuation which may  include qualitative issues with respect to Metals   Mining s management

8,83,Comment  Unethical sales practices create significant potential violations of the  Code and Standards  Warner s opinion of the Milton bonds must not be affected by  internal pressure or compensation  In this case Warner must refuse to push the  Milton bonds unless she is able to justify that the market price has already adjusted  for the operating problem

5,84,Comment  Grant has violated Standard I B  because accepting these substantial  gifts may impede his independence and objectivity  Every member and candidate  should endeavor to avoid situations that might cause or be perceived to cause a loss  of independence or objectivity in recommending investments or taking investment  action  By accepting the trip Grant has opened himself up to the accusation that he  may give the broker favored treatment in return 
6,84,Example    Gifts and Entertainment from Client  
7,84,Theresa Green manages the portfolio of Ian Knowlden a client of Tisbury Investments  Green  achieves an annual return for Knowlden that is consistently better than that of the benchmark  she and the client previously agreed to  As a reward Knowlden offers Green two tickets to  Wimbledon and the use of Knowlden s flat in London for a week  Green discloses this gift to  her supervisor at Tisbury 
8,84,Comment  Green is in compliance with Standard I B  because she disclosed the gift  from one of her clients in accordance with the firm s policies  Members and  candidates may accept bonuses or gifts from clients as long as they disclose them to  their employer because gifts in a client relationship are deemed less likely to affect  a member s or candidate s objectivity and independence than gifts in other  situations  Disclosure is required however so that supervisors can monitor such  situations to guard against employees favoring a gift giving client to the detriment  of other fee paying clients  such as by allocating a greater proportion of IPO stock  to the gift giving client s portfolio  
9,84,Best practices for monitoring include comparing the transaction costs of the  Knowlden account with the costs of other accounts managed by Green and other  similar accounts within Tisbury  The supervisor could also compare the  performance returns with the returns of other clients with the same mandate  This  comparison will assist in determining whether a pattern of favoritism by Green is  disadvantaging other Tisbury clients or the possibility that this favoritism could  affect her future behavior

2,85,Example    Travel Expenses from External Manager  
3,85,Tom Wayne is the investment manager of the Franklin City Employees Pension Plan  He  recently completed a successful search for a firm to manage the foreign equity allocation of the  plan s diversified portfolio  He followed the plan s standard procedure of seeking presentations  from a number of qualified firms and recommended that his board select Penguin Advisors  because of its experience well defined investment strategy and performance record  The firm  claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards  GIPS  and has been  verified  Following the selection of Penguin a reporter from the Franklin City Record calls to  ask if there was any connection between this action and the fact that Penguin was one of the  sponsors of an  investment fact finding trip to Asia  that Wayne made earlier in the year  The  trip was one of several conducted by the Pension Investment Academy which had arranged the  itinerary of meetings with economic government and corporate officials in major cities in  several Asian countries  The Pension Investment Academy obtains support for the cost of these  trips from a number of investment managers including Penguin Advisors  the Academy then  pays the travel expenses of the various pension plan managers on the trip and provides all meals  and accommodations  The president of Penguin Advisors was also one of the travelers on the  trip 
4,85,Comment  Although Wayne can probably put to good use the knowledge he gained  from the trip in selecting portfolio managers and in other areas of managing the  pension plan his recommendation of Penguin Advisors may be tainted by the  possible conflict incurred when he participated in a trip partly paid for by Penguin  Advisors and when he was in the daily company of the president of Penguin  Advisors  To avoid violating Standard I B  Wayne s basic expenses for travel and  accommodations should have been paid by his employer or the pension plan   contact with the president of Penguin Advisors should have been limited to  informational or educational events only  and the trip the organizer and the  sponsor should have been made a matter of public record  Even if his actions were  not in violation of Standard I B  Wayne should have been sensitive to the public  perception of the trip when reported in the newspaper and the extent to which the  subjective elements of his decision might have been affected by the familiarity that  the daily contact of such a trip would encourage  This advantage would probably  not be shared by firms competing with Penguin Advisors

2,86,Comment  If Herrero accepts this payment arrangement he will be in violation of  Standard I B  because the compensation arrangement can reasonably be expected  to compromise his independence and objectivity  Herrero will receive a bonus for  attracting investors which provides an incentive to draft a positive report  regardless of the facts and to ignore or play down any negative information about  the company  Herrero should accept only a flat fee that is not tied to the  conclusions or recommendations of the report  Issuer paid research that is objective  and unbiased can be done under the right circumstances as long as the analyst takes  steps to maintain his or her objectivity and includes in the report proper disclosures  regarding potential conflicts of interest

4,86,Two years ago Bob Wade trust manager for Central Midas Bank was approached by Western  Funds about promoting its family of funds with special interest in the service fee class of  funds  To entice Central to promote this class Western Funds offered to pay the bank a service  fee of        Without disclosing the fee being offered to the bank Wade asked one of the  investment managers to review Western s funds to determine whether they were suitable for  clients of Central Midas Bank  The manager completed the normal due diligence review and  determined that the new funds were fairly valued in the market with fee structures on a par with  competitors  Wade decided to accept Western s offer and instructed the team of portfolio  managers to exclusively promote these funds and the service fee class to clients seeking to  invest new funds or transfer from their current investments 
5,86,Now two years later the funds managed by Western begin to underperform their peers  Wade  is counting on the fees to reach his profitability targets and continues to push these funds as  acceptable investments for Central s clients 
6,86,Comment  Wade is violating Standard I B  because the fee arrangement has  affected the objectivity of his recommendations  Wade is relying on the fee as a  component of the department s profitability and is unwilling to offer other products  that may affect the fees received

9,86,Bob Thompson has been doing research for the portfolio manager of the fixed income  department  His assignment is to do sensitivity analysis on securitized subprime mortgages  He  has discussed with the manager possible scenarios to use to calculate expected returns  A key  assumption in such calculations is housing price appreciation  HPA  because it drives   prepays   prepayments of mortgages  and losses  Thompson is concerned with the significant  appreciation experienced over the previous five years as a result of the increased availability of  funds from subprime mortgages  Thompson insists that the analysis should include a scenario  run with      for Year       for Year   and then  to project a worst case scenario     for  Years   through    The manager replies that these assumptions are too dire because there has  never been a time in their available database when HPA was negative

3,87,Comment  Thompson s actions in running the worst case scenario against the  protests of the portfolio manager are in alignment with the principles of Standard I  B   Thompson did not allow his research to be pressured by the general trends of  the market or the manager s desire to limit the research to historical norms

6,87,Adrian Mandel CFA is a senior portfolio manager for ZZYY Capital Management who  oversees a team of investment professionals who manage labor union pension funds  A few  years ago ZZYY sought to win a competitive asset manager search to manage a significant  allocation of the pension fund of the United Doughnut and Pretzel Bakers Union  UDPBU    UDPBU s investment board is chaired by a recognized key decision maker and long time leader  of the union Ernesto Gomez  To improve ZZYY s chances of winning the competition Mandel  made significant monetary contributions to Gomez s union reelection campaign fund  Even  after ZZYY was hired as a primary manager of the pension Mandel believed that his firm s  position was not secure  Mandel continued to contribute to Gomez s reelection campaign chest  as well as to entertain lavishly the union leader and his family at top restaurants on a regular  basis  All of Mandel s outlays were routinely handled as marketing expenses reimbursed by  ZZYY s expense accounts and were disclosed to his senior management as being instrumental  in maintaining a strong close relationship with an important client 
7,87,Comment  Mandel not only offered but actually gave monetary gifts benefits and  other considerations that reasonably could be expected to compromise Gomez s  objectivity  Therefore Mandel was in violation of Standard I B  
8,87,Example     Influencing Manager Selection Decisions  
9,87,Adrian Mandel CFA had heard about the manager search competition for the UDPBU Pension  Fund through a broker dealer contact  The contact told him that a well known retired  professional golfer Bobby  The Bear  Finlay who had become a licensed broker dealer  serving as a pension consultant was orchestrating the UDPBU manager search  Finlay had  gained celebrity status with several labor union pension fund boards by entertaining their  respective board members and regaling them with colorful stories of fellow pro golfers  antics  in clubhouses around the world  Mandel decided to improve ZZYY s chances of being invited  to participate in the search competition by befriending Finlay to curry his favor  Knowing  Finlay s love of entertainment Mandel wined and dined Finlay at high profile bistros where  Finlay could glow in the fan recognition lavished on him by all the other patrons  Mandel s  endeavors paid off handsomely when Finlay recommended to the UDPBU board that ZZYY be  entered as one of three finalist asset management firms in its search

3,88,Example     Fund Manager Relationships  
4,88,Amie Scott is a performance analyst within her firm with responsibilities for analyzing the  performance of external managers  While completing her quarterly analysis Scott notices a  change in one manager s reported composite construction  The change concealed the bad  performance of a particularly large account by placing that account into a new residual  composite  This change allowed the manager to remain at the top of the list of manager  performance  Scott knows her firm has a large allocation to this manager and the fund s  manager is a close personal friend of the CEO  She needs to deliver her final report but is  concerned with pointing out the composite change 
5,88,Comment  Scott would be in violation of Standard I B  if she did not disclose the  change in her final report  The analysis of managers  performance should not be  influenced by personal relationships or the size of the allocation to the outside  managers  By not including the change Scott would not be providing an  independent analysis of the performance metrics for her firm 
6,88,Example     Intrafirm Pressure  
7,88,Jill Stein is head of performance measurement for her firm  During the last quarter many  members of the organization s research department were removed because of the poor quality  of their recommendations  The subpar research caused one larger account holder to experience  significant underperformance which resulted in the client withdrawing his money after the end  of the quarter  The head of sales requests that Stein remove this account from the firm s  performance composite because the performance decline can be attributed to the departed  research team and not the client s adviser 
8,88,Comment  Pressure from other internal departments can create situations that cause  a member or candidate to violate the Code and Standards  Stein must maintain her  independence and objectivity and refuse to exclude specific accounts from the  firm s performance composites to which they belong  As long as the client invested  under a strategy similar to that of the defined composite it cannot be excluded  because of the poor stock selections that led to the underperformance and asset  withdrawal

10,89,Trust is the foundation of the investment profession  Investors must be able to rely on the  statements and information provided to them by those with whom the investors have trusted  their financial well being  Investment professionals who make false or misleading statements  not only harm investors but also reduce the level of investor confidence in the investment  profession and threaten the integrity of capital markets as a whole 
11,89,A misrepresentation is any untrue statement or omission of a fact or any statement that is  otherwise false or misleading  A member or candidate must not knowingly omit or misrepresent  information or give a false impression of a firm organization or security in the member s or  candidate s oral representations advertising  whether in the press or through brochures   electronic communications or written materials  whether publicly disseminated or not   In this  context  knowingly  means that the member or candidate either knows or should have known  that the misrepresentation was being made or that omitted information could alter the  investment decision making process 
12,89,Written materials include but are not limited to research reports underwriting documents  company financial reports market letters newspaper columns and books  Electronic  communications include but are not limited to internet communications webpages mobile  applications and e mails  Members and candidates who use webpages should regularly monitor  materials posted on these sites to ensure that they contain current information  Members and  candidates should also ensure that all reasonable precautions have been taken to protect the  site s integrity and security and that the site does not misrepresent any information and does  provide full disclosure 
13,89,Standard I C  prohibits members and candidates from guaranteeing clients any specific return  on volatile investments  Most investments contain some element of risk that makes their return  inherently unpredictable  For such investments guaranteeing either a particular rate of return or  a guaranteed preservation of investment capital  e g   I can guarantee that you will earn    on  equities this year  or  I can guarantee that you will not lose money on this investment   is  misleading to investors  Standard I C  does not prohibit members and candidates from  providing clients with information on investment products that have guarantees built into the  structure of the products themselves or for which an institution has agreed to cover any losses

2,90,Impact on Investment Practice
3,90,Members and candidates must not misrepresent any aspect of their practice including  but not  limited to  their qualifications or credentials the qualifications or services provided by their  firm their performance record and the record of their firm and the characteristics of an  investment  Any misrepresentation made by a member or candidate relating to the member s or  candidate s professional activities is a breach of this standard 
4,90,Members and candidates should exercise care and diligence when incorporating third party  information  Misrepresentations resulting from the use of the credit ratings research  testimonials or marketing materials of outside parties become the responsibility of the  investment professional when it affects that professional s business practices 
5,90,Investing through outside managers continues to expand as an acceptable method of investing  in areas outside a firm s core competencies  Members and candidates must disclose their  intended use of external managers and must not represent those managers  investment practices  as their own  Although the level of involvement of outside managers may change over time  appropriate disclosures by members and candidates are important in avoiding  misrepresentations especially if the primary activity is to invest directly with a single external  manager  Standard V B  Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients discusses in  further detail communicating the firm s investment practices 
6,90,Performance Reporting
7,90,The performance benchmark selection process is another area where misrepresentations may  occur  Members and candidates may misrepresent the success of their performance record  through presenting benchmarks that are not comparable to their strategies  Further clients can  be misled if the benchmark s results are not reported on a basis comparable to that of the fund s  or client s results  Best practice is selecting the most appropriate available benchmark from a  universe of available options  The transparent presentation of appropriate performance  benchmarks is an important aspect in providing clients with information that is useful in making  investment decisions 
8,90,However Standard I C  does not require that a benchmark always be provided in order to  comply  Some investment strategies may not lend themselves to displaying an appropriate  benchmark because of the complexity or diversity of the investments included  Furthermore  some investment strategies may use reference indexes that do not reflect the opportunity set of  the invested assets for example a hedge fund comparing its performance with a  cash plus   basis  When such a benchmark is used members and candidates should make reasonable efforts  to ensure that they disclose the reasons behind the use of this reference index to avoid  misrepresentations of their performance  Members and candidates should discuss with clients  on a continuous basis the appropriate benchmark to be used for performance evaluations and  related fee calculations 
9,90,Reporting misrepresentations may also occur when valuations for illiquid or non traded  securities are available from more than one source  When different options are available  members and candidates may be tempted to switch providers to obtain higher security  valuations  The process of shopping for values may misrepresent a security s worth lead to  misinformed decisions to sell or hold an investment and result in overcharging clients advisory  fees

2,91,Members and candidates should take reasonable steps to provide accurate and reliable security  pricing information to clients on a consistent basis  Changing pricing providers should not be  based solely on the justification that the new provider reports a higher current value of a  security  Consistency in the reported information will improve the perception of the valuation  process for illiquid securities  Clients will likely have additional confidence that they were able  to make an informed decision about continuing to hold these securities in their portfolios 
3,91,Social Media
4,91,The advancement of online discussion forums and communication platforms commonly  referred to as  social media  is placing additional responsibilities on members and candidates   When communicating through social media channels members and candidates should provide  only the same information they are allowed to distribute to clients and potential clients through  other traditional forms of communication  The online or interactive aspects of social media do  not remove the need to be open and honest about the information being distributed 
5,91,Along with understanding and following existing and newly developing rules and regulations  regarding the allowed use of social media members and candidates should also ensure that all  communications in this format adhere to the requirements of the Code and Standards  The  perceived anonymity granted through these platforms may entice individuals to misrepresent  their qualifications or abilities or those of their employer  Actions undertaken through social  media that knowingly misrepresent investment recommendations or professional activities are  considered a violation of Standard I C  
6,91,Omissions
7,91,The omission of a fact or outcome can be misleading especially given the growing use of  models and technical analysis processes  Many members and candidates rely on such models  and processes to scan for new investment opportunities to develop investment vehicles and to  produce investment recommendations and ratings  When inputs are knowingly omitted the  resulting outcomes may provide misleading information to those who rely on it for making  investment decisions  Additionally the outcomes from models shall not be presented as fact  because they represent the expected results based on the inputs and analysis process  incorporated 
8,91,Omissions in the performance measurement and attribution process can also misrepresent a  manager s performance and skill  Members and candidates should encourage their firms to  develop strict policies for composite development to prevent cherry picking situations in  which selected accounts are presented as representative of the firm s abilities  The omission of  any accounts appropriate for the defined composite may misrepresent to clients the success of  the manager s implementation of its strategy

2,92,Plagiarism
3,92,Standard I C  also prohibits plagiarism in the preparation of material for distribution to  employers associates clients prospects or the general public  Plagiarism is defined as copying  or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without acknowledging the  source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of such material  Members and  candidates must not copy  or represent as their own  original ideas or material without  permission and must acknowledge and identify the source of ideas or material that is not their  own 
4,92,The investment profession uses a myriad of financial economic and statistical data in the  investment decision making process  Through various publications and presentations the  investment professional is constantly exposed to the work of others and to the temptation to use  that work without proper acknowledgment 
5,92,Misrepresentation through plagiarism in investment management can take various forms  The  simplest and most flagrant example is to take a research report or study done by another firm or  person change the names and release the material as one s own original analysis  This action is  a clear violation of Standard I C   Other practices include     using excerpts from articles or  reports prepared by others either verbatim or with only slight changes in wording without  acknowledgment     citing specific quotations as attributable to  leading analysts  and   investment experts  without naming the specific references     presenting statistical estimates  of forecasts prepared by others and identifying the sources but without including the qualifying  statements or caveats that may have been used     using charts and graphs without stating their  sources and     copying proprietary computerized spreadsheets or algorithms without seeking  the cooperation or authorization of their creators 
6,92,In the case of distributing third party outsourced research members and candidates may use  and distribute such reports as long as they do not represent themselves as the report s authors   Indeed the member or candidate may add value for the client by sifting through research and  repackaging it for clients  In such cases clients should be fully informed that they are paying  for the ability of the member or candidate to find the best research from a wide variety of  sources  Members and candidates must not misrepresent their abilities the extent of their  expertise or the extent of their work in a way that would mislead their clients or prospective  clients  Members and candidates should disclose whether the research being presented to clients  comes from another source from either within or outside the member s or candidate s firm   This allows clients to understand who has the expertise behind the report or whether the work is  being done by the analyst other members of the firm or an outside party 
7,92,Standard I C  also applies to plagiarism in oral communications such as through group  meetings  visits with associates clients and customers  use of audio video media  which is  rapidly increasing   and telecommunications including electronic data transfer and the outright  copying of electronic media 
8,92,One of the most egregious practices in violation of this standard is the preparation of research  reports based on multiple sources of information without acknowledging the sources  Examples  of information from such sources include ideas statistical compilations and forecasts combined  to give the appearance of original work  Although there is no monopoly on ideas members and  candidates must give credit where it is clearly due  Analysts should not use undocumented  forecasts earnings projections asset values and so on  Sources must be revealed to bring the  responsibility directly back to the author of the report or the firm involved

2,93,Work Completed for Employer
3,93,The preceding paragraphs address actions that would constitute a violation of Standard I C   In  some situations however members or candidates may use research conducted or models  developed by others within the same firm without committing a violation  The most common  example relates to the situation in which one  or more  of the original analysts is no longer with  the firm  Research and models developed while employed by a firm are the property of the firm   The firm retains the right to continue using the work completed after a member or candidate has  left the organization  The firm may issue future reports without providing attribution to the prior  analysts  A member or candidate cannot however reissue a previously released report solely  under his or her name 
4,93,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
5,93,Factual Presentations
6,93,Members and candidates can prevent unintentional misrepresentations of their qualifications or  the services they or their firms provide if each member and candidate understands the limit of  the firm s or individual s capabilities and the need to be accurate and complete in presentations   Firms can provide guidance for employees who make written or oral presentations to clients or  potential clients by providing a written list of the firm s available services and a description of  the firm s qualifications  This list should suggest ways of describing the firm s services  qualifications and compensation that are both accurate and suitable for client or customer  presentations  Firms can also help prevent misrepresentation by specifically designating which  employees are authorized to speak on behalf of the firm  Regardless of whether the firm  provides guidance members and candidates should make certain that they understand the  services the firm can perform and its qualifications 
7,93,Qualification Summary
8,93,In addition to ensure accurate presentations to clients each member and candidate should  prepare a summary of his or her own qualifications and experience and a list of the services the  member or candidate is capable of performing  Firms can assist member and candidate  compliance by periodically reviewing employee correspondence and documents that contain  representations of individual or firm qualifications 
9,93,Verify Outside Information
10,93,When providing information to clients from a third party members and candidates share a  responsibility for the accuracy of the marketing and distribution materials that pertain to the  third party s capabilities services and products  Misrepresentation by third parties can damage  the member s or candidate s reputation the reputation of the firm and the integrity of the  capital markets  Members and candidates should encourage their employers to develop  procedures for verifying information of third party firms

12,94,Comment  McGuire has violated Standard I C  because the website is misleading to  potential investors  Even if the recommendations are valid and supported with  thorough research his omissions regarding the true relationship between himself  and the companies he covers constitute a misrepresentation  McGuire has also  violated Standard VI A  Disclosure of Conflicts by not disclosing the existence of  an arrangement with the companies through which he receives compensation in  exchange for his services

4,95,Comment  Once the error is discovered Yao must take steps to cease distribution of  the incorrect material and correct the error by informing those who have received  the erroneous information  Because Yao did not knowingly make the  misrepresentation however he did not violate Standard I C   Because his firm  claims compliance with the GIPS standards it must also comply with the GIPS  Guidance Statement on Error Correction in relation to the error

9,96,Steve Swanson is a senior analyst in the investment research department of Ballard and  Company  Apex Corporation has asked Ballard to assist in acquiring the majority ownership of  stock in the Campbell Company a financial consulting firm and to prepare a report  recommending that stockholders of Campbell agree to the acquisition  Another investment firm  Davis and Company had already prepared a report for Apex analyzing both Apex and  Campbell and recommending an exchange ratio  Apex has given the Davis report to Ballard  officers who have passed it on to Swanson  Swanson reviews the Davis report and other  available material on Apex and Campbell  From his analysis he concludes that the common  stocks of Campbell and Apex represent good value at their current prices  he believes however  that the Davis report does not consider all the factors a Campbell stockholder would need to  know to make a decision  Swanson reports his conclusions to the partner in charge who tells  him to  use the Davis report change a few words sign your name and get it out  
10,96,Comment  If Swanson does as requested he will violate Standard I C   He could  refer to those portions of the Davis report that he agrees with if he identifies Davis  as the source  he could then add his own analysis and conclusions to the report  before signing and distributing it

3,97,Claude Browning a quantitative analyst for Double Alpha Inc  returns from a seminar in great  excitement  At that seminar Jack Jorrely a well known quantitative analyst at a national  brokerage firm discussed one of his new models in great detail and Browning is intrigued by  the new concepts  He proceeds to test the model making some minor mechanical changes but  retaining the concepts until he produces some very positive results  Browning quickly  announces to his supervisors at Double Alpha that he has discovered a new model and that  clients and prospective clients should be informed of this positive finding as ongoing proof of  Double Alpha s continuing innovation and ability to add value 
4,97,Comment  Although Browning tested Jorrely s model on his own and even slightly  modified it he must still acknowledge the original source of the idea  Browning  can certainly take credit for the final practical results  he can also support his  conclusions with his own test  The credit for the innovative thinking however  must be awarded to Jorrely

7,97,Comment  Copying verbatim any material without acknowledgement including  plain language descriptions of the P E multiple and standard deviation violates  Standard I C   Even though these concepts are general best practice would be for  Zubia to describe them in his own words or cite the sources from which the  descriptions are quoted  Members and candidates would be violating Standard I C   if they either were responsible for creating marketing materials without attribution  or knowingly use plagiarized materials

2,98,Comment  In all instances a member or candidate must cite the actual source of the  information  Best practice for Schneider would be to obtain the information directly  from the author and review it before citing it in a report  In that case Schneider  would not need to report how she found out about the information  For example  suppose Schneider read in the Financial Times about a study issued by CFA  Institute  best practice for Schneider would be to obtain a copy of the study from  CFA Institute review it and then cite it in her report  If she does not use any  interpretation of the report from the Financial Times and the newspaper does not  add value to the report itself the newspaper is merely a conduit of the original  information and does not need to be cited  If she does not obtain the report and  review the information Schneider runs the risk of relying on second hand  information that may misstate facts  If for example the Financial Times erroneously reported some information from the original CFA Institute study and  Schneider copied that erroneous information without acknowledging CFA Institute  she could be the object of complaints  Best practice would be either to obtain the  complete study from its original author and cite only that author or to use the  information provided by the intermediary and cite both sources

5,98,Comment  Ostrowski can rely on third party research that has a reasonable and  adequate basis but he cannot imply that he is the author of such research  If he  does Ostrowski is misrepresenting the extent of his work in a way that misleads  the firm s clients or prospective clients

7,98,Tom Stafford is part of a team within Appleton Investment Management responsible for  managing a pool of assets for Open Air Bank which distributes structured securities to offshore  clients  He becomes aware that Open Air is promoting the structured securities as a much less  risky investment than the investment management policy followed by him and the team to  manage the original pool of assets  Also Open Air has procured an independent rating for the  pool that significantly overstates the quality of the investments  Stafford communicates his  concerns to his supervisor who responds that Open Air owns the product and is responsible for  all marketing and distribution  Stafford s supervisor goes on to say that the product is outside of  the US regulatory regime that Appleton follows and that all risks of the product are disclosed at  the bottom of page     of the prospectus 
8,98,Comment  As a member of the investment team Stafford is qualified to recognize  the degree of accuracy of the materials that characterize the portfolio and he is  correct to be worried about Appleton s responsibility for a misrepresentation of the  risks  Thus he should continue to pursue the issue of Open Air s inaccurate  promotion of the portfolio according to the firm s policies and procedures

3,99,Example     Avoiding a Misrepresentation  
4,99,Trina Smith is a fixed income portfolio manager at a pension fund  She has observed that the  market for highly structured mortgages is the focus of salespeople she meets and that these  products represent a significant number of trading opportunities  In discussions about this topic  with her team Smith learns that calculating yields on changing cash flows within the deal  structure requires very specialized vendor software  After more research they find out that each  deal is unique and that deals can have more than a dozen layers and changing cash flow  priorities  Smith comes to the conclusion that because of the complexity of these securities the  team cannot effectively distinguish between potentially good and bad investment options  To  avoid misrepresenting their understanding the team decides that the highly structured mortgage  segment of the securitized market should not become part of the core of the fund s portfolio   they will allow some of the less complex securities to be part of the core 
5,99,Comment  Smith is in compliance with Standard I C  by not investing in securities  that she and her team cannot effectively understand  Because she is not able to  describe the risk and return profile of the securities to the pension fund  beneficiaries and trustees she appropriately limits the fund s exposure to this  sector 
6,99,Example     Misrepresenting Composite Construction  
7,99,Robert Palmer is head of performance for a fund manager  When asked to provide performance  numbers to fund rating agencies he avoids mentioning that the fund manager is quite liberal in  composite construction  The reason accounts are included excluded is not fully explained  The  performance values reported to the rating agencies for the composites although accurate for the  accounts shown each period may not present a true representation of the fund manager s  ability 
8,99,Comment   Cherry picking  accounts to include in either published reports or  information provided to rating agencies conflicts with Standard I C   Moving  accounts into or out of a composite to influence the overall performance results  materially misrepresents the reported values over time  Palmer should work with  his firm to strengthen its reporting practices concerning composite construction to  avoid misrepresenting the firm s track record or the quality of the information  being provided

2,100,Finch knows that some of the fact sheets are out of date  for example one long only fund  approved the use of significant leverage last quarter as a method to enhance returns  He  continues to provide the sheets to the sales team without updates because the bank has no  control over the marketing material released by the mutual fund firms 
3,100,Comment  Finch is violating Standard I C  by providing information that  misrepresents aspects of the funds  By not providing the sales team and ultimately  the clients with the updated information he is misrepresenting the potential risks  associated with the funds with outdated fact sheets  Finch can instruct the sales  team to clarify the deficiencies in the fact sheets with clients and ensure they have  the most recent fund prospectus document before accepting orders for investing in  any fund 
4,100,Example     Overemphasis of Firm Results  
5,100,Bob Anderson is chief compliance officer for Optima Asset Management Company a firm  currently offering eight funds to clients  Seven of the eight had    year returns below the  median for their respective sectors  Anderson approves a recent advertisement which includes  this statement   Optima Asset Management is achieving excellent returns for its investors  The  Optima Emerging Markets Equity fund for example has    year returns that exceed the sector  median by more than      
6,100,Comment  From the information provided it is difficult to determine whether a  violation has occurred as long as the sector outperformance is correct  Anderson  may be attempting to mislead potential clients by citing the performance of the sole  fund that achieved such results  Past performance is often used to demonstrate a  firm s skill and abilities in comparison to funds in the same sectors 
7,100,However if all the funds outperformed their respective benchmarks then  Anderson s assertion that the company  is achieving excellent returns  may be  factual  Funds may exhibit positive returns for investors exceed benchmarks and  yet have returns below the median in their sectors 
8,100,Members and candidates need to ensure that their marketing efforts do not include  statements that misrepresent their skills and abilities to remain compliant with  Standard I C   Unless the returns of a single fund reflect the performance of a firm  as a whole the use of a singular fund for performance comparisons should be  avoided

2,101,Guidance
3,101,Whereas Standard I A  addresses the obligation of members and candidates to comply with  applicable law that governs their professional activities Standard I D  addresses all conduct  that reflects poorly on the professional integrity good reputation or competence of members  and candidates  Any act that involves lying cheating stealing or other dishonest conduct is a  violation of this standard if the offense reflects adversely on a member s or candidate s  professional activities  Although CFA Institute discourages any sort of unethical behavior by  members and candidates the Code and Standards are primarily aimed at conduct and actions  related to a member s or candidate s professional life 
4,101,Conduct that damages trustworthiness or competence may include behavior that although not  illegal nevertheless negatively affects a member s or candidate s ability to perform his or her  responsibilities  For example abusing alcohol during business hours might constitute a  violation of this standard because it could have a detrimental effect on the member s or  candidate s ability to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities  Personal bankruptcy may  not reflect on the integrity or trustworthiness of the person declaring bankruptcy but if the  circumstances of the bankruptcy involve fraudulent or deceitful business conduct the  bankruptcy may be a violation of this standard 
5,101,In some cases the absence of appropriate conduct or the lack of sufficient effort may be a  violation of Standard I D   The integrity of the investment profession is built on trust  A  member or candidate whether an investment banker rating or research analyst or portfolio  manager is expected to conduct the necessary due diligence to properly understand the nature  and risks of an investment before making an investment recommendation  By not taking these  steps and instead relying on someone else in the process to perform them members or  candidates may violate the trust their clients have placed in them  This loss of trust may have a  significant impact on the reputation of the member or candidate and the operations of the  financial market as a whole 
6,101,Individuals may attempt to abuse the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program by actively  seeking CFA Institute enforcement of the Code and Standards and Standard I D  in particular  as a method of settling personal political or other disputes unrelated to professional ethics   CFA Institute is aware of this issue and appropriate disciplinary policies procedures and  enforcement mechanisms are in place to address misuse of the Code and Standards and the  Professional Conduct Program in this way 
7,101,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
8,101,In addition to ensuring that their own behavior is consistent with Standard I D  to prevent  general misconduct members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt the  following policies and procedures to support the principles of Standard I D  
9,101,  Code of ethics  Develop and or adopt a code of ethics to which every employee must  subscribe and make clear that any personal behavior that reflects poorly on the individual  involved the institution as a whole or the investment industry will not be tolerated

6,102,Comment  Sasserman s excessive drinking at lunch and subsequent intoxication at  work constitute a violation of Standard I D  because this conduct has raised  questions about his professionalism and competence  His behavior reflects poorly  on him his employer and the investment industry

4,103,Comment  Generally Standard I D  is not meant to cover legal transgressions  resulting from acts of civil disobedience in support of personal beliefs because such  conduct does not reflect poorly on the member s or candidate s professional  reputation integrity or competence

6,103,Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy side trading desk of an investment management firm and  concentrates on in house trades for a hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the  investment management firm  The hedge fund has been very successful and is marketed  globally by the firm  From her experience as the trader for much of the activity of the fund  Rasmussen has become quite knowledgeable about the hedge fund s strategy tactics and  performance  When a distinct break in the market occurs and many of the securities involved in  the hedge fund s strategy decline markedly in value Rasmussen observes that the reported  performance of the hedge fund does not reflect this decline  In her experience the lack of effect  is a very unlikely occurrence  She approaches the head of trading about her concern and is told  that she should not ask any questions and that the fund is big and successful and is not her  concern  She is fairly sure something is not right so she contacts the compliance officer who  also tells her to stay away from the issue of the hedge fund s reporting 
7,103,Comment  Rasmussen has clearly come across an error in policies procedures and  compliance practices within the firm s operations  According to the firm s  procedures for reporting potentially unethical activity she should pursue the issue  by gathering some proof of her reason for doubt  Should all internal  communications within the firm not satisfy her concerns Rasmussen should  consider reporting the potential unethical activity to the appropriate regulator

11,104,Trading or inducing others to trade on material nonpublic information erodes confidence in  capital markets institutions and investment professionals by supporting the idea that those with  inside information and special access can take unfair advantage of the general investing public   Although trading on inside information may lead to short term profits in the long run  individuals and the profession as a whole suffer from such trading  These actions have caused  and will continue to cause investors to avoid capital markets because the markets are perceived  to be  rigged  in favor of the knowledgeable insider  When the investing public avoids capital  markets the markets and capital allocation become less efficient and less supportive of strong  and vibrant economies  Standard II A  promotes and maintains a high level of confidence in  market integrity which is one of the foundations of the investment profession 
12,104,The prohibition on using this information goes beyond the direct buying and selling of  individual securities or bonds  Members and candidates must not use material nonpublic  information to influence their investment actions related to derivatives  e g  swaps or option  contracts  mutual funds or other alternative investments  Any trading based on material  nonpublic information constitutes a violation of Standard II A   The expansion of financial  products and the increasing interconnectivity of financial markets globally have resulted in new  potential opportunities for trading on material nonpublic information 
13,104,What Is  Material  Information 
14,104,Information is  material  if its disclosure would probably have an impact on the price of a  security or if reasonable investors would want to know the information before making an  investment decision  In other words information is material if it would significantly alter the  total mix of information currently available about a security in such a way that the price of the  security would be affected

2,105,The specificity of the information the extent of its difference from public information its  nature and its reliability are key factors in determining whether a particular piece of  information fits the definition of material  For example material information may include but  is not limited to information on the following 
3,105,  earnings 
4,105,  mergers acquisitions tender offers or joint ventures 
5,105,  changes in assets or asset quality 
6,105,  innovative products processes or discoveries  e g  new product trials or research  efforts  
7,105,  new licenses patents registered trademarks or regulatory approval rejection of a  product 
8,105,  developments regarding customers or suppliers  e g  the acquisition or loss of a contract  
9,105,  changes in management 
10,105,  change in auditor notification or the fact that the issuer may no longer rely on an auditor s  report or qualified opinion 
11,105,  events regarding the issuer s securities  e g  defaults on senior securities calls of  securities for redemption repurchase plans stock splits changes in dividends changes to  the rights of security holders and public or private sales of additional securities  
12,105,  bankruptcies 
13,105,  significant legal disputes 
14,105,  government reports of economic trends  employment housing starts currency  information etc   
15,105,  orders for large trades before they are executed  and
16,105,  new or changing equity or debt ratings issued by a third party  e g  sell side  recommendations and credit ratings  
17,105,In addition to the substance and specificity of the information the source or relative reliability  of the information also determines materiality  The less reliable a source the less likely the  information provided would be considered material  For example factual information from a  corporate insider regarding a significant new contract for a company is likely to be material  whereas an assumption based on speculation by a competitor about the same contract is likely  to be less reliable and therefore not material  Additionally information about trials of a new  drug product or service under development from qualified personnel involved in the trials is  likely to be material whereas educated conjecture by subject experts not connected to the trials  is unlikely to be material 
18,105,Also the more ambiguous the effect of the information on price the less material that  information is considered  If it is unclear whether and to what extent the information will affect  the price of a security the information may not be considered material  The passage of time  may also render information that was once important immaterial

2,106,What Constitutes  Nonpublic  Information 
3,106,Information is  nonpublic  until it has been disseminated or is available to the marketplace in  general  as opposed to a select group of investors    Disseminated  can be defined as  made  known   For example a company report of profits that is posted on the internet and distributed  widely through a press release or accompanied by a filing has been effectively disseminated to  the marketplace  Members and candidates must have a reasonable expectation that people have  received the information before it can be considered public  It is not necessary however to wait  for the slowest method of delivery  Once the information is disseminated to the market it is  public information that is no longer covered by this standard 
4,106,Members and candidates must be particularly aware of information that is selectively disclosed  by corporations to a small group of investors analysts or other market participants  Information  that is made available to analysts remains nonpublic until it is made available to investors in  general  Corporations that disclose information on a limited basis create the potential for  insider trading violations 
5,106,Issues of selective disclosure often arise when a corporate insider provides material information  to analysts in a briefing or conference call before that information is released to the public   Analysts must be aware that a disclosure made to a room full of analysts does not necessarily  make the disclosed information  public   Analysts should also be alert to the possibility that  they are selectively receiving material nonpublic information when a company provides them  with guidance or interpretation of such publicly available information as financial statements or  regulatory filings 
6,106,A member or candidate may use insider information provided legitimately by the source  company for the specific purpose of conducting due diligence according to the business  agreement between the parties for such activities as mergers loan underwriting credit ratings  and offering engagements  In such instances the investment professional would not be  considered in violation of Standard II A  by using the material information  However the use of  insider information provided by the source company for other purposes especially to trade or  entice others to trade the securities of the firm conflicts with this standard 
7,106,Mosaic Theory
8,106,A financial analyst gathers and interprets large quantities of information from many sources   The analyst may use significant conclusions derived from the analysis of public and  nonmaterial nonpublic information as the basis for investment recommendations and decisions  even if those conclusions would have been material inside information had they been  communicated directly to the analyst by a company  Under the  mosaic theory  financial  analysts are free to act on this collection or mosaic of information without risking violation 
9,106,The practice of financial analysis depends on the free flow of information  For the fair and  efficient operation of the capital markets analysts and investors must have the greatest amount  of information possible to facilitate making well informed investment decisions about how and  where to invest capital  Accurate timely and intelligible communication is essential if analysts  and investors are to obtain the data needed to make informed decisions about how and where to  invest capital  These disclosures must go beyond the information mandated by the reporting  requirements of the securities laws and should include specific business information about items  used to guide a company s future growth such as new products capital projects and the  competitive environment  Analysts seek and use such information to compare and contrast  investment alternatives

2,107,Much of the information used by analysts comes directly from companies  Analysts often  receive such information through contacts with corporate insiders especially investor relations  staff and financial officers  Information may be disseminated in the form of press releases  through oral presentations by company executives in analysts  meetings or conference calls or  during analysts  visits to company premises  In seeking to develop the most accurate and  complete picture of a company analysts should also reach beyond contacts with companies  themselves and collect information from other sources such as customers contractors  suppliers and the companies  competitors 
3,107,Analysts are in the business of formulating opinions and insights that are not obvious to the  general investing public about the attractiveness of particular securities  In the course of their  work analysts actively seek out corporate information not generally known to the market for  the express purpose of analyzing that information forming an opinion on its significance and  informing their clients who can be expected to trade on the basis of the recommendation   Analysts  initiatives to discover and analyze information and communicate their findings to  their clients significantly enhance market efficiency thus benefiting all investors  see Dirks v   Securities and Exchange Commission   Accordingly violations of Standard II A  will not result  when a perceptive analyst reaches a conclusion about a corporate action or event through an  analysis of public information and items of nonmaterial nonpublic information 
4,107,Investment professionals should note however that although analysts are free to use mosaic  information in their research reports they should save and document all their research  see  Standard V C  Record Retention   Evidence of the analyst s knowledge of public and  nonmaterial nonpublic information about a corporation strengthens the assertion that the analyst  reached his or her conclusions solely through appropriate methods rather than through the use  of material nonpublic information 
5,107,Social Media
6,107,The continuing advancement in technology allows members candidates and the industry at  large to exchange information at rates not previously available  It is important for investment  professionals to understand the implications of using information from the internet and social  media platforms because all such information may not actually be considered public 
7,107,Some social media platforms require membership in specific groups in order to access the  published content  Members and candidates participating in groups with membership  limitations should verify that material information obtained from these sources can also be  accessed from a source that would be considered available to the public  e g  company filings  webpages and press releases  
8,107,Members and candidates may use social media platforms to communicate with clients or  investors without conflicting with this standard  As long as the information reaches all clients or  is open to the investing public the use of these platforms would be comparable with other  traditional forms of communications such as e mails and press releases  Members and  candidates as required by Standard I A  should also complete all appropriate regulatory filings  related to information distributed through social media platforms

2,108,Using Industry Experts
3,108,The increased demand for insights for understanding the complexities of some industries has  led to an expansion of engagement with outside experts  As the level of engagement increased  new businesses formed to connect analysts and investors with individuals who have specialized  knowledge of their industry  e g  technology or pharmaceuticals   These networks offer  investors the opportunity to reach beyond their usual business circles to speak with experts  regarding economic conditions industry trends and technical issues relating to specific  products and services 
4,108,Members and candidates may provide compensation to individuals for their insights without  violating this standard  However members and candidates are ultimately responsible for  ensuring that they are not requesting or acting on confidential information received from  external experts which is in violation of security regulations and laws or duties to others  As the  recent string of insider trading cases displayed some experts are willing to provide confidential  and protected information for the right incentive 
5,108,Firms connecting experts with members or candidates often require both parties to sign  agreements concerning the disclosure of material nonpublic information  Even with the  protections from such compliance practices if an expert provides material nonpublic  information members and candidates would be prohibited from taking investment actions on  the associated firm until the information became publicly known to the market 
6,108,Investment Research Reports
7,108,When a particularly well known or respected analyst issues a report or makes changes to his or  her recommendation that information alone may have an effect on the market and thus may be  considered material  Theoretically under Standard II A  such a report would have to be made  public at the time it was distributed to clients  The analyst is not a company insider however  and does not have access to inside information  Presumably the analyst created the report from  information available to the public  mosaic theory  and by using his or her expertise to interpret  the information  The analyst s hard work paid for by the client generated the conclusions 
8,108,Simply because the public in general would find the conclusions material does not require that  the analyst make his or her work public  Investors who are not clients of the analyst can either  do the work themselves or become clients of the analyst to gain access to the analyst s  expertise 
9,108,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
10,108,Achieve Public Dissemination
11,108,If a member or candidate determines that information is material the member or candidate  should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information  These  efforts usually entail encouraging the issuing company to make the information public  If public  dissemination is not possible the member or candidate must communicate the information only  to the designated supervisory and compliance personnel within the member s or candidate s  firm and must not take investment action or alter current investment recommendations on the  basis of the information  Moreover members and candidates must not knowingly engage in any  conduct that may induce company insiders to privately disclose material nonpublic information

2,109,Adopt Compliance Procedures
3,109,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt compliance procedures to  prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information  Particularly important is improving  compliance in such areas as the review of employee and proprietary trading the review of  investment recommendations documentation of firm procedures and the supervision of  interdepartmental communications in multiservice firms  Compliance procedures should suit the  particular characteristics of a firm including its size and the nature of its business 
4,109,Members and candidates are encouraged to inform their supervisor and compliance personnel of  suspected inappropriate use of material nonpublic information as the basis for security trading  activities or recommendations being made within their firm 
5,109,Adopt Disclosure Procedures
6,109,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to develop and follow disclosure policies  designed to ensure that information is disseminated to the marketplace in an equitable manner   For example analysts from small firms should receive the same information and attention from  a company as analysts from large firms receive  Similarly companies should not provide  certain information to buy side analysts but not to sell side analysts or vice versa  Furthermore  a company should not discriminate among analysts in the provision of information or   blackball  particular analysts who have given negative reports on the company in the past 
7,109,Within investment and research firms members and candidates should encourage the  development of and compliance with procedures for distributing new and updated investment  opinions to clients  Recommendations of this nature may represent material market moving  information that needs to be communicated to all clients fairly 
8,109,Issue Press Releases
9,109,Companies should consider issuing press releases prior to analyst meetings and conference calls  and scripting those meetings and calls to decrease the chance that further information will be  disclosed  If material nonpublic information is disclosed for the first time in an analyst meeting  or call the company should promptly issue a press release or otherwise make the information  publicly available 
10,109,Firewall Elements
11,109,An information barrier commonly referred to as a  firewall  is the most widely used approach  for preventing the communication of material nonpublic information within firms  It restricts  the flow of confidential information to those who need to know the information to perform their  jobs effectively  The minimum elements of such a system include but are not limited to the  following 
12,109,  substantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications preferably through a  clearance area within the firm in either the compliance or legal department 
13,109,  review of employee trading through the maintenance of  watch   restricted  and   rumor  lists

2,110,  documentation of the procedures designed to limit the flow of information between  departments and of the actions taken to enforce those procedures  and
3,110,  heightened review or restriction of proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of  material nonpublic information 
4,110,Appropriate Interdepartmental Communications
5,110,Although documentation requirements must for practical reasons take into account the  differences between the activities of small firms and those of large multiservice firms firms of  all sizes and types benefit by improving the documentation of their internal enforcement of  firewall procedures  Therefore even at small firms procedures concerning interdepartmental  communication the review of trading activity and the investigation of possible violations  should be compiled and formalized 
6,110,Physical Separation of Departments
7,110,As a practical matter to the greatest extent possible firms should consider the physical  separation of departments and files to prevent the communication of sensitive information that  should not be shared  For example the investment banking and corporate finance areas of a  brokerage firm should be separated from the sales and research departments and a bank s  commercial lending department should be segregated from its trust and research departments 
8,110,Prevention of Personnel Overlap
9,110,There should be no overlap of personnel between the investment banking and corporate finance  areas of a brokerage firm and the sales and research departments or between a bank s  commercial lending department and its trust and research departments  For a firewall to be  effective in a multiservice firm an employee should be on only one side of the firewall at any  time  Inside knowledge may not be limited to information about a specific offering or the  current financial condition of a company  Analysts may be exposed to much information about  the company including new product developments or future budget projections that clearly  constitute inside knowledge and thus preclude the analyst from returning to his or her research  function  For example an analyst who follows a particular company may provide limited  assistance to the investment bankers under carefully controlled circumstances when the firm s  investment banking department is involved in a deal with the company  That analyst must then  be treated as though he or she were an investment banker  the analyst must remain on the  investment banking side of the wall until any information he or she learns is publicly disclosed   In short the analyst cannot use any information learned in the course of the project for research  purposes and cannot share that information with colleagues in the research department

2,111,A Reporting System
3,111,A primary objective of an effective firewall procedure is to establish a reporting system in  which authorized people review and approve communications between departments  If an  employee behind a firewall believes that he or she needs to share confidential information with  someone on the other side of the wall the employee should consult a designated compliance  officer to determine whether sharing the information is necessary and how much information  should be shared  If the sharing is necessary the compliance officer should coordinate the  process of  looking over the wall  so that the necessary information will be shared and the  integrity of the procedure will be maintained 
4,111,A single supervisor or compliance officer should have the specific authority and responsibility  of deciding whether information is material and whether it is sufficiently public to be used as  the basis for investment decisions  Ideally the supervisor or compliance officer responsible for  communicating information to a firm s research or brokerage area would not be a member of  that area 
5,111,Personal Trading Limitations
6,111,Firms should consider restrictions or prohibitions on personal trading by employees and should  carefully monitor both proprietary trading and personal trading by employees  Firms should  require employees to make periodic reports  to the extent that such reporting is not already  required by securities laws  of their own transactions and transactions made for the benefit of  family members  Securities should be placed on a restricted list when a firm has or may have  material nonpublic information  The broad distribution of a restricted list often triggers the sort  of trading the list was developed to avoid  Therefore a watch list shown to only the few people  responsible for compliance should be used to monitor transactions in specified securities  The  use of a watch list in combination with a restricted list is an increasingly common means of  ensuring effective control of personal trading 
7,111,Record Maintenance
8,111,Multiservice firms should maintain written records of the communications between various  departments  Firms should place a high priority on training and should consider instituting  comprehensive training programs particularly for employees in sensitive areas

2,112,Proprietary Trading Procedures
3,112,Procedures concerning the restriction or review of a firm s proprietary trading while the firm  possesses material nonpublic information will necessarily depend on the types of proprietary  trading in which the firm may engage  A prohibition on all types of proprietary activity when a  firm comes into possession of material nonpublic information is not appropriate  For example  when a firm acts as a market maker a prohibition on proprietary trading may be  counterproductive to the goals of maintaining the confidentiality of information and market  liquidity  This concern is particularly important in the relationships between small regional  broker dealers and small issuers  In many situations a firm will take a small issuer public with  the understanding that the firm will continue to be a market maker in the stock  In such  instances a withdrawal by the firm from market making activities would be a clear tip to  outsiders  Firms that continue market making activity while in the possession of material  nonpublic information should however instruct their market makers to remain passive with  respect to the market that is to take only the contra side of unsolicited customer trades 
4,112,In risk arbitrage trading the case for a trading prohibition is more compelling than it is in the  case of market making  The impetus for arbitrage trading is neither passive nor reactive and the  potential for illegal profits is greater than in market making  The most prudent course for firms  is to suspend arbitrage activity when a security is placed on the watch list  Those firms that  continue arbitrage activity face a high hurdle in proving the adequacy of their internal  procedures for preventing trading on material nonpublic information and must demonstrate a  stringent review and documentation of firm trades 
5,112,Communication to All Employees
6,112,Members and candidates should encourage their employers to circulate written compliance  policies and guidelines to all employees  Policies and guidelines should be used in conjunction  with training programs aimed at enabling employees to recognize material nonpublic  information  Such information is not always clearly identifiable 
7,112,Employees must be given sufficient training to either make an informed decision or to realize  they need to consult a supervisor or compliance officer before engaging in questionable  transactions  Appropriate policies reinforce that using material nonpublic information is illegal  in many countries  Such trading activities based on material nonpublic information undermine  the integrity of the individual the firm and the capital markets

4,113,Samuel Peter an analyst with Scotland and Pierce Incorporated is assisting his firm with a  secondary offering for Bright Ideas Lamp Company  Peter participates via telephone  conference call in a meeting with Scotland and Pierce investment banking employees and  Bright Ideas  CEO  Peter is advised that the company s earnings projections for the next year  have significantly dropped  Throughout the telephone conference call several Scotland and  Pierce salespeople and portfolio managers walk in and out of Peter s office where the  telephone call is taking place  As a result they are aware of the drop in projected earnings for  Bright Ideas  Before the conference call is concluded the salespeople trade the stock of the  company on behalf of the firm s clients and other firm personnel trade the stock in a firm  proprietary account and in employees  personal accounts 
5,113,Comment  Peter has violated Standard II A  because he failed to prevent the  transfer and misuse of material nonpublic information to others in his firm  Peter s  firm should have adopted information barriers to prevent the communication of  nonpublic information between departments of the firm  The salespeople and  portfolio managers who traded on the information have also violated Standard II  A  by trading on inside information

8,113,Comment  Levenson must first determine whether the material information is  public  According to Standard II A  if the company has not made this information  public  a small group forum does not qualify as a method of public dissemination   she cannot use the information

2,114,Comment  Although information on an expected takeover bid may be of the type  that is generally material and nonpublic in this case the source of information is  unreliable so the information cannot be considered material  Therefore Fechtman  is not prohibited from trading the stock on the basis of this information 
3,114,Example    Applying the Mosaic Theory  
4,114,Jagdish Teja is a buy side analyst covering the furniture industry  Looking for an attractive  company to recommend as a buy he analyzes several furniture makers by studying their  financial reports and visiting their operations  He also talks to some designers and retailers to  find out which furniture styles are trendy and popular  Although none of the companies that he  analyzes are a clear buy he discovers that one of them Swan Furniture Company  SFC  may  be in financial trouble  SFC s extravagant new designs have been introduced at substantial cost   Even though these designs initially attracted attention the public is now buying more  conservative furniture from other makers  Based on this information and on a profit and loss  analysis Teja believes that SFC s next quarter earnings will drop substantially  He issues a sell  recommendation for SFC  Immediately after receiving that recommendation investment  managers start reducing the SFC stock in their portfolios 
5,114,Comment  Information on quarterly earnings data is material and nonpublic  Teja  arrived at his conclusion about the earnings drop on the basis of public information  and on pieces of nonmaterial nonpublic information  such as opinions of designers  and retailers   Therefore trading based on Teja s correct conclusion is not  prohibited by Standard II A

7,114,Roger Clement is a senior financial analyst who specializes in the European automobile sector  at Rivoli Capital  Because he has been repeatedly nominated by many leading industry  magazines and newsletters as a  best analyst  for the automobile industry he is widely regarded  as an authority on the sector  After speaking with representatives of Turgot Chariots a  European auto manufacturer with sales primarily in South Korea and after conducting  interviews with salespeople labor leaders his firm s Korean currency analysts and banking  officials Clement analyzed Turgot Chariots and concluded that     its newly introduced model  will probably not meet sales expectations     its corporate restructuring strategy may well face  serious opposition from unions     the depreciation of the Korean won should lead to pressure  on margins for the industry in general and Turgot s market segment in particular and     banks  could take a tougher than expected stance in the upcoming round of credit renegotiations with  the company  For these reasons he changes his conclusion about the company from  market  outperform  to  market underperform   Clement retains the support material used to reach his  conclusion in case questions later arise 
8,114,Comment  To reach a conclusion about the value of the company Clement has  pieced together a number of nonmaterial or public bits of information that affect  Turgot Chariots  Therefore under the mosaic theory Clement has not violated  Standard II A  in drafting the report

4,115,Comment  When Zito receives advance notice of Clement s change of opinion she  knows it will have a material impact on the stock price even if she is not totally  aware of Clement s underlying reasoning  She is not a client of Clement but obtains  early access to the material nonpublic information prior to publication  Her trades  are thus based on material nonpublic information and violate Standard II A  
5,115,Zito further violates the Standard by relaying the information to her father  It would  not matter if he or any other family member traded  the act of providing the  information violates Standard II A   The fact that the information is provided to a  family member does not absolve someone of the prohibition of using or  communicating material nonpublic information

8,115,Comment  Even though Kellogg believes that Mayfield would not break the law by  disclosing inside information and money was lost on the purchase Kellogg should  not have purchased additional shares of National  It is the member s or candidate s  responsibility to make sure before executing investment actions that comments  about earnings are not material nonpublic information  Kellogg has violated  Standard II A

4,116,Comment  Doll s conversation with the senior executive is part of the mosaic of  information used in recommending Boyce  When holding discussions with a firm  executive Doll would need to guard against soliciting or obtaining material  nonpublic information  Before issuing the report the executive s statement about  the continuing development of the product would need to be weighed against the  other known public facts to determine whether it would be considered material

7,116,Comment  There are often rumors and whisper numbers before a release of any  kind  The text message from the other trader would most likely be considered  market noise  Unless Nadler knew that the trader had an ongoing business  relationship with the public firm he had no reason to suspect he was receiving  material nonpublic information that would prevent him from completing the trading  request of the portfolio manager

5,117,Comment  Watson has violated Standard II A  by passing along material nonpublic  information concerning the ongoing product tests which the fund used to trade in  the securities and options of the related company  Watson cannot simply rely on the  agreements signed by individuals who participate in expert networks that state that  he has not received information that would prohibit his trading activity  He must  make his own determination whether information he received through these  arrangements reaches a materiality threshold that would affect his trading abilities

12,117,Standard II B  requires that members and candidates uphold market integrity by prohibiting  market manipulation  Market manipulation includes practices that distort security prices or  trading volume with the intent to deceive people or entities that rely on information in the  market  Market manipulation damages the interests of all investors by disrupting the smooth  functioning of financial markets and lowering investor confidence

2,118,Market manipulation may lead to a lack of trust in the fairness of the capital markets resulting  in higher risk premiums and reduced investor participation  A reduction in the efficiency of a  local capital market may negatively affect the growth and economic health of the country and  may also influence the operations of the globally interconnected capital markets  Although  market manipulation may be less likely to occur in mature financial markets than in emerging  markets cross border investing increasingly exposes all global investors to the potential for  such practices 
3,118,Market manipulation includes     the dissemination of false or misleading information and      transactions that deceive or would be likely to mislead market participants by distorting the  price setting mechanism of financial instruments  The development of new products and  technologies increases the incentives means and opportunities for market manipulation   Additionally the increasing complexity and sophistication of the technologies used for  communicating with market participants have created new avenues for manipulation 
4,118,Information Based Manipulation
5,118,Information based manipulation includes but is not limited to spreading false rumors to induce  trading by others  For example members and candidates must refrain from  pumping up  the  price of an investment by issuing misleading positive information or overly optimistic  projections of a security s worth only to later  dump  the investment  i e  sell it  once the price  fueled by the misleading information s effect on other market participants reaches an  artificially high level 
6,118,Transaction Based Manipulation
7,118,Transaction based manipulation involves instances where a member or candidate knew or  should have known that his or her actions could affect the pricing of a security  This type of  manipulation includes but is not limited to the following 
8,118,  transactions that artificially affect prices or volume to give the impression of activity or  price movement in a financial instrument which represent a diversion from the  expectations of a fair and efficient market and
9,118,  securing a controlling dominant position in a financial instrument to exploit and  manipulate the price of a related derivative and or the underlying asset 
10,118,Standard II B  is not intended to preclude transactions undertaken on legitimate trading  strategies based on perceived market inefficiencies  The intent of the action is critical to  determining whether it is a violation of this standard

2,119,Example    Independent Analysis and Company Promotion  
3,119,The principal owner of Financial Information Services  FIS  entered into an agreement with  two microcap companies to promote the companies  stock in exchange for stock and cash  compensation  The principal owner caused FIS to disseminate e mails design and maintain  several websites and distribute an online investment newsletter all of which recommended  investment in the two companies  The systematic publication of purportedly independent  analyses and recommendations containing inaccurate and highly promotional and speculative  statements increased public investment in the companies and led to dramatically higher stock  prices 
4,119,Comment  The principal owner of FIS violated Standard II B  by using inaccurate  reporting and misleading information under the guise of independent analysis to  artificially increase the stock price of the companies  Furthermore the principal  owner violated Standard V A  Diligence and Reasonable Basis by not having a  reasonable and adequate basis for recommending the two companies and violated  Standard VI A  Disclosure of Conflicts by not disclosing to investors the  compensation agreements  which constituted a conflict of interest

6,119,John Gray is a private investor in Belgium who bought a large position several years ago in  Fame Pharmaceuticals a German small cap security with limited average trading volume  He  has now decided to significantly reduce his holdings owing to the poor price performance  Gray  is worried that the low trading volume for the stock may cause the price to decline further as he  attempts to sell his large position 
7,119,Gray devises a plan to divide his holdings into multiple accounts in different brokerage firms  and private banks in the names of family members friends and even a private religious  institution  He then creates a rumor campaign on various blogs and social media outlets  promoting the company 
8,119,Gray begins to buy and sell the stock using the accounts in hopes of raising the trading volume  and the price  He conducts the trades through multiple brokers selling slightly larger positions  than he bought on a tactical schedule and over time he is able to reduce his holding as desired  without negatively affecting the sale price 
9,119,Comment  John violated Standard II B  by fraudulently creating the appearance  that there was a greater investor interest in the stock through the online rumors   Additionally through his trading strategy he created the appearance that there was  greater liquidity in the stock than actually existed  He was able to manipulate the  price through both misinformation and trading practices

4,120,  Wirewolf s highly respected chief financial officer may be about to join another  company 
5,120,Knowing that Wirewolf has already entered its declared quarter end  quiet period  before  reporting earnings  and thus would be reluctant to respond to rumors  Murphy times the release  of his research report specifically to sensationalize the negative aspects of the message in order  to create significant downward pressure on Wirewolf s stock to the distinct advantage of  Divisadero s hedge fund clients  The report s conclusions are based on speculation not on fact   The next day the research report is broadcast to all of Divisadero s clients and to the usual  newswire services 
6,120,Before Wirewolf s investor relations department can assess the damage on the final trading day  of the quarter and refute Murphy s report its stock opens trading sharply lower allowing  Divisadero s clients to cover their short positions at substantial gains

10,120,Comment  Sekar s plan would be beneficial for his funds  participants but is based  on artificial distortion of both trading volume and the price of the DD stock and  thus constitutes a violation of Standard II B

2,121,Comment  The formal liquidity of a market is determined by the obligations set on  market makers but the actual liquidity of a market is better estimated by the actual  trading volume and bid ask spreads  Attempts to mislead participants about the  actual liquidity of the market constitute a violation of Standard II B   In this  example investors have been intentionally misled to believe they chose the most  liquid instrument for some specific purpose but they could eventually see the  actual liquidity of the contract significantly reduced after the term of the agreement  expires  If the ACME Futures Exchange fully discloses its agreement with  members to boost transactions over some initial launch period it will not violate  Standard II B   ACME s intent is not to harm investors but on the contrary to give  them a better service  For that purpose it may engage in a liquidity pumping  strategy but the strategy must be disclosed

4,121,Emily Gordon an analyst of household products companies is employed by a research  boutique Picador   Co  Based on information that she has gathered during a trip through Latin  America she believes that Hygene Inc  a major marketer of personal care products has  generated better than expected sales from its new product initiatives in South America  After  modestly boosting her projections for revenue and for gross profit margin in her worksheet  models for Hygene Gordon estimates that her earnings projection of US      per diluted share  for the current year may be as much as    too low  She contacts the chief financial officer   CFO  of Hygene to try to gain confirmation of her findings from her trip and to get some  feedback regarding her revised models  The CFO declines to comment and reiterates  management s most recent guidance of US      US      for the year 
5,121,Gordon decides to try to force a comment from the company by telling Picador   Co  clients  who follow a momentum investment style that consensus earnings projections for Hygene are  much too low  she explains that she is considering raising her published estimate by an  ambitious US      to US      per share  She believes that when word of an unrealistically  high earnings projection filters back to Hygene s investor relations department the company  will feel compelled to update its earnings guidance  Meanwhile Gordon hopes that she is at  least correct with respect to the earnings direction and that she will help clients who act on her  insights to profit from a quick gain by trading on her advice 
6,121,Comment  By exaggerating her earnings projections in order to try to fuel a quick  gain in Hygene s stock price Gordon is in violation of Standard II B    Furthermore by virtue of previewing her intentions of revising upward her  earnings projections to only a select group of clients she is in violation of Standard  III B  Fair Dealing  However it would have been acceptable for Gordon to write a  report that
7,121,  framed her earnings projection in a range of possible outcomes
8,121,  outlined clearly the assumptions used in her Hygene models that took into  consideration the findings from her trip through Latin America and

5,122,Example    Manipulating Model Inputs  
6,122,Bill Mandeville supervises a structured financing team for Superior Investment Bank  His  responsibilities include packaging new structured investment products and managing Superior s  relationship with relevant rating agencies  To achieve the best rating possible Mandeville uses  mostly positive scenarios as model inputs scenarios that reflect minimal downside risk in the  assets underlying the structured products  The resulting output statistics in the rating request and  underwriting prospectus support the idea that the new structured products have minimal  potential downside risk  Additionally Mandeville s compensation from Superior is partially  based on both the level of the rating assigned and the successful sale of new structured  investment products but does not have a link to the long term performance of the instruments 
7,122,Mandeville is extremely successful and leads Superior as the top originator of structured  investment products for the next two years  In the third year the economy experiences  difficulties and the values of the assets underlying structured products significantly decline  The  subsequent defaults lead to major turmoil in the capital markets the demise of Superior  Investment Bank and the loss of Mandeville s employment 
8,122,Comment  Mandeville manipulates the inputs of a model to minimize associated  risk to achieve higher ratings  His understanding of structured products allows him  to skillfully decide which inputs to include in support of the desired rating and  price  This information manipulation for short term gain which is in violation of  Standard II B  ultimately causes significant damage to many parties and the capital  markets as a whole  Mandeville should have realized that promoting a rating and  price with inaccurate information could cause not only a loss of price confidence in  the particular structured product but also a loss of investor trust in the system  Such  loss of confidence affects the ability of the capital markets to operate efficiently

13,123,Standard III A  clarifies that client interests are paramount  A member s or candidate s  responsibility to a client includes a duty of loyalty and a duty to exercise reasonable care   Investment actions must be carried out for the sole benefit of the client and in a manner the  member or candidate believes given the known facts and circumstances to be in the best  interest of the client  Members and candidates must exercise the same level of prudence  judgment and care that they would apply in the management and disposition of their own  interests in similar circumstances

2,124,Prudence requires caution and discretion  The exercise of prudence by investment professionals  requires that they act with the care skill and diligence that a reasonable person acting in a like  capacity and familiar with such matters would use  In the context of managing a client s  portfolio prudence requires following the investment parameters set forth by the client and  balancing risk and return  Acting with care requires members and candidates to act in a prudent  and judicious manner in avoiding harm to clients 
3,124,Standard III A  sets minimum expectations for members and candidates when fulfilling their  responsibilities to their clients  Regulatory and legal requirements for such duties can vary  across the investment industry depending on a variety of factors including job function of the  investment professional the existence of an adviser client relationship and the nature of the  recommendations being offered  From the perspective of the end user of financial services  these different standards can be arcane and confusing leaving investors unsure of what level of  service to expect from investment professionals they employ  The single standard of conduct  described in Standard III A  benefits investors by establishing a benchmark for the duties of  loyalty prudence and care and clarifies that all CFA Institute members and candidates  regardless of job title local laws or cultural differences are required to comply with these  fundamental responsibilities  Investors hiring members or candidates who must adhere to the  duty of loyalty prudence and care set forth in this standard can be confident that these  responsibilities are a requirement regardless of any legally imposed fiduciary duties 
4,124,Standard III A  however is not a substitute for a member s or candidate s legal or regulatory  obligations  As stated in Standard I A  members and candidates must abide by the most strict  requirements imposed on them by regulators or the Code and Standards including any legally  imposed fiduciary duty  Members and candidates must also be aware of whether they have   custody  or effective control of client assets  If so a heightened level of responsibility arises   Members and candidates are considered to have custody if they have any direct or indirect  access to client funds  Members and candidates must manage any pool of assets in their control  in accordance with the terms of the governing documents  such as trust documents and  investment management agreements  which are the primary determinant of the manager s  powers and duties  Whenever their actions are contrary to provisions of those instruments or  applicable law members and candidates are at risk of violating Standard III A  
5,124,Understanding the Application of Loyalty Prudence and Care
6,124,Standard III A  establishes a minimum benchmark for the duties of loyalty prudence and care  that are required of all members and candidates regardless of whether a legal fiduciary duty  applies  Although fiduciary duty often encompasses the principles of loyalty prudence and  care Standard III A  does not render all members and candidates fiduciaries  The  responsibilities of members and candidates for fulfilling their obligations under this standard  depend greatly on the nature of their professional responsibilities and the relationships they  have with clients  The conduct of members and candidates may or may not rise to the level of  being a fiduciary depending on the type of client whether the member or candidate is giving  investment advice and the many facts and circumstances surrounding a particular transaction or  client relationship

2,125,Fiduciary duties are often imposed by law or regulation when an individual or institution is  charged with the duty of acting for the benefit of another party such as managing investment  assets  The duty required in fiduciary relationships exceeds what is acceptable in many other  business relationships because a fiduciary is in an enhanced position of trust  Although  members and candidates must comply with any legally imposed fiduciary duty the Code and  Standards neither impose such a legal responsibility nor require all members or candidates to  act as fiduciaries  However Standard III A  requires members and candidates to work in the  client s best interest no matter what the job function 
3,125,A member or candidate who does not provide advisory services to a client but who acts only as  a trade execution professional must prudently work in the client s interest when completing  requested trades  Acting in the client s best interest requires these professionals to use their  skills and diligence to execute trades in the most favorable terms that can be achieved  Members  and candidates operating in such positions must use care to operate within the parameters set by  the client s trading instructions 
4,125,Members and candidates may also operate in a blended environment where they execute client  trades and offer advice on a limited set of investment options  The extent of the advisory  arrangement and limitations should be outlined in the agreement with the client at the outset of  the relationship  For instance members and candidates should inform clients that the advice  provided will be limited to the propriety products of the firm and not include other products  available on the market  Clients who want access to a wider range of investment products would  have the information necessary to decide not to engage with members or candidates working  under these restrictions 
5,125,Members and candidates operating in this blended context would comply with their obligations  by recommending the allowable products that are consistent with the client s objectives and risk  tolerance  They would exercise care through diligently aligning the client s needs with the  attributes of the products being recommended  Members and candidates should place the  client s interests first by disregarding any firm or personal interest in motivating a  recommended transaction 
6,125,There is a large variety of professional relationships that members and candidates have with  their clients  Standard III A  requires them to fulfill the obligations outlined explicitly or  implicitly in the client agreements to the best of their abilities and with loyalty prudence and  care  Whether a member or candidate is structuring a new securitization transaction completing  a credit rating analysis or leading a public company he or she must work with prudence and  care in delivering the agreed on services 
7,125,Identifying the Actual Investment Client
8,125,The first step for members and candidates in fulfilling their duty of loyalty to clients is to  determine the identity of the  client  to whom the duty of loyalty is owed  In the context of an  investment manager managing the personal assets of an individual the client is easily  identified  When the manager is responsible for the portfolios of pension plans or trusts  however the client is not the person or entity who hires the manager but rather the  beneficiaries of the plan or trust  The duty of loyalty is owed to the ultimate beneficiaries

2,126,In some situations an actual client or group of beneficiaries may not exist  Members and  candidates managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate owe the duty of loyalty  prudence and care to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate  The decisions of a  fund s manager although benefiting all fund investors do not have to be based on an individual  investor s requirements and risk profile  Client loyalty and care for those investing in the fund  are the responsibility of members and candidates who have an advisory relationship with those  individuals 
3,126,Situations involving potential conflicts of interest with respect to responsibilities to clients may  be extremely complex because they may involve a number of competing interests  The duty of  loyalty prudence and care applies to a large number of persons in varying capacities but the  exact duties may differ in many respects in accord with the relationship with each client or each  type of account in which the assets are managed  Members and candidates must not only put  their obligations to clients first in all dealings but also endeavor to avoid all real or potential  conflicts of interest 
4,126,Members and candidates with positions whose responsibilities do not include direct investment  management also have  clients  that must be considered  Just as there are various types of  advisory relationships members and candidates must look at their roles and responsibilities  when making a determination of who their clients are  Sometimes the client is easily  identifiable  such is the case in the relationship between a company executive and the firm s  public shareholders  At other times the client may be the investing public as a whole in which  case the goals of independence and objectivity of research surpass the goal of loyalty to a single  organization 
5,126,Developing the Client s Portfolio
6,126,The duty of loyalty prudence and care owed to the individual client is especially important  because the professional investment manager typically possesses greater knowledge in the  investment arena than the client does  This disparity places the individual client in a vulnerable  position  the client must trust the manager  The manager in these situations should ensure that  the client s objectives and expectations for the performance of the account are realistic and  suitable to the client s circumstances and that the risks involved are appropriate  In most  circumstances recommended investment strategies should relate to the long term objectives  and circumstances of the client 
7,126,Particular care must be taken to detect whether the goals of the investment manager or the firm  in conducting business selling products and executing security transactions potentially conflict  with the best interests and objectives of the client  When members and candidates cannot avoid  potential conflicts between their firm and clients  interests they must provide clear and factual  disclosures of the circumstances to the clients 
8,126,Members and candidates must follow any guidelines set by their clients for the management of  their assets  Some clients such as charitable organizations and pension plans have strict  investment policies that limit investment options to certain types or classes of investment or  prohibit investment in certain securities  Other organizations have aggressive policies that do  not prohibit investments by type but instead set criteria on the basis of the portfolio s total risk  and return

2,127,Investment decisions must be judged in the context of the total portfolio rather than by  individual investment within the portfolio  The member s or candidate s duty is satisfied with  respect to a particular investment if the individual has thoroughly considered the investment s  place in the overall portfolio the risk of loss and opportunity for gains tax implications and the  diversification liquidity cash flow and overall return requirements of the assets or the portion  of the assets for which the manager is responsible 
3,127,Soft Commission Policies
4,127,An investment manager often has discretion over the selection of brokers executing  transactions  Conflicts may arise when an investment manager uses client brokerage to purchase  research services a practice commonly called  soft dollars  or  soft commissions   A member  or candidate who pays a higher brokerage commission than he or she would normally pay to  allow for the purchase of goods or services without corresponding benefit to the client violates  the duty of loyalty to the client 
5,127,From time to time a client will direct a manager to use the client s brokerage to purchase goods  or services for the client a practice that is commonly called  directed brokerage   Because  brokerage commission is an asset of the client and is used to benefit that client not the  manager such a practice does not violate any duty of loyalty  However a member or candidate  is obligated to seek  best price  and  best execution  and be assured by the client that the goods  or services purchased from the brokerage will benefit the account beneficiaries   Best  execution  refers to a trading process that seeks to maximize the value of the client s portfolio  within the client s stated investment objectives and constraints  In addition the member or  candidate should disclose to the client that the client may not be getting best execution from the  directed brokerage 
6,127,Proxy Voting Policies
7,127,The duty of loyalty prudence and care may apply in a number of situations facing the  investment professional besides those related directly to investing assets 
8,127,Part of a member s or candidate s duty of loyalty includes voting proxies in an informed and  responsible manner  Proxies have economic value to a client and members and candidates must  ensure that they properly safeguard and maximize this value  An investment manager who fails  to vote casts a vote without considering the impact of the question or votes blindly with  management on nonroutine governance issues  e g  a change in company capitalization  may  violate this standard  Voting of proxies is an integral part of the management of investments 
9,127,A cost benefit analysis may show that voting all proxies may not benefit the client so voting  proxies may not be necessary in all instances  Members and candidates should disclose to  clients their proxy voting policies

11,128,  Diversify  Members and candidates should diversify investments to reduce the risk of  loss unless diversification is not consistent with plan guidelines or is contrary to the  account objectives

2,129,  Vote proxies  In most cases members and candidates should determine who is authorized  to vote shares and vote proxies in the best interests of the clients and ultimate  beneficiaries 
3,129,  Maintain confidentiality  Members and candidates must preserve the confidentiality of  client information 
4,129,  Seek best execution  Unless directed by the client as ultimate beneficiary members and  candidates must seek best execution for their clients   Best execution is defined in the  preceding text  
5,129,  Place client interests first  Members and candidates must serve the best interests of  clients 
6,129,Application of the Standard
7,129,Example    Identifying the Client Plan Participants  
8,129,First Country Bank serves as trustee for the Miller Company s pension plan  Miller is the target  of a hostile takeover attempt by Newton Inc  In attempting to ward off Newton Miller s  managers persuade Julian Wiley an investment manager at First Country Bank to purchase  Miller common stock in the open market for the employee pension plan  Miller s officials  indicate that such action would be favorably received and would probably result in other  accounts being placed with the bank  Although Wiley believes the stock is overvalued and  would not ordinarily buy it he purchases the stock to support Miller s managers to maintain  Miller s good favor toward the bank and to realize additional new business  The heavy stock  purchases cause Miller s market price to rise to such a level that Newton retracts its takeover  bid 
9,129,Comment  Standard III A  requires that a member or candidate in evaluating a  takeover bid act prudently and solely in the interests of plan participants and  beneficiaries  To meet this requirement a member or candidate must carefully  evaluate the long term prospects of the company against the short term prospects  presented by the takeover offer and by the ability to invest elsewhere  In this  instance Wiley acting on behalf of his employer which was the trustee for a  pension plan clearly violated Standard III A   He used the pension plan to  perpetuate existing management perhaps to the detriment of plan participants and  the company s shareholders and to benefit himself  Wiley s responsibilities to the  plan participants and beneficiaries should have taken precedence over any ties of  his bank to corporate managers and over his self interest  Wiley had a duty to  examine the takeover offer on its own merits and to make an independent decision   The guiding principle is the appropriateness of the investment decision to the  pension plan not whether the decision benefited Wiley or the company that hired  him

2,130,Example    Client Commission Practices  
3,130,JNI a successful investment counseling firm serves as investment manager for the pension  plans of several large regionally based companies  Its trading activities generate a significant  amount of commission related business  JNI uses the brokerage and research services of many  firms but most of its trading activity is handled through a large brokerage company Thompson  Inc  because the executives of the two firms have a close friendship  Thompson s commission  structure is high in comparison with charges for similar brokerage services from other firms   JNI considers Thompson s research services and execution capabilities average  In exchange for  JNI directing its brokerage to Thompson Thompson absorbs a number of JNI overhead  expenses including those for rent 
4,130,Comment  JNI executives are breaching their responsibilities by using client  brokerage for services that do not benefit JNI clients and by not obtaining best  price and best execution for their clients  Because JNI executives are not upholding  their duty of loyalty they are violating Standard III A  
5,130,Example    Brokerage Arrangements  
6,130,Charlotte Everett a struggling independent investment adviser serves as investment manager  for the pension plans of several companies  One of her brokers Scott Company is close to  consummating management agreements with prospective new clients whereby Everett would  manage the new client accounts and trade the accounts exclusively through Scott  One of  Everett s existing clients Crayton Corporation has directed Everett to place securities  transactions for Crayton s account exclusively through Scott  But to induce Scott to exert efforts  to send more new accounts to her Everett also directs transactions to Scott from other clients  without their knowledge 
7,130,Comment  Everett has an obligation at all times to seek best price and best  execution on all trades  Everett may direct new client trades exclusively through  Scott Company as long as Everett receives best price and execution on the trades or  receives a written statement from new clients that she is not to seek best price and  execution and that they are aware of the consequence for their accounts  Everett  may trade other accounts through Scott as a reward for directing clients to Everett  only if the accounts receive best price and execution and the practice is disclosed to  the accounts  Because Everett does not disclose the directed trading Everett has  violated Standard III A

9,130,Emilie Rome is a trust officer for Paget Trust Company  Rome s supervisor is responsible for  reviewing Rome s trust account transactions and her monthly reports of personal stock  transactions  Rome has been using Nathan Gray a broker almost exclusively for trust account  brokerage transactions  When Gray makes a market in stocks he has been giving Rome a lower  price for personal purchases and a higher price for sales than he gives to Rome s trust accounts  and other investors 
10,130,Comment  Rome is violating her duty of loyalty to the bank s trust accounts by  using Gray for brokerage transactions simply because Gray trades Rome s personal  account on favorable terms  Rome is placing her own interests before those of her  clients

2,131,Example    Client Commission Practices  
3,131,Lauren Parker an analyst with Provo Advisors covers South American equities for her firm   She likes to travel to the markets for which she is responsible and decides to go on a trip to  Chile Argentina and Brazil  The trip is sponsored by SouthAM Inc  a research firm with a  small broker dealer affiliate that uses the clearing facilities of a larger New York brokerage  house  SouthAM specializes in arranging South American trips for analysts during which they  can meet with central bank officials government ministers local economists and senior  executives of corporations  SouthAM accepts commission dollars at a ratio of   to   against the  hard dollar costs of the research fee for the trip  Parker is not sure that SouthAM s execution is  competitive but without informing her supervisor she directs the trading desk at Provo to start  giving commission business to SouthAM so she can take the trip  SouthAM has conveniently  timed the briefing trip to coincide with the beginning of Carnival season so Parker also decides  to spend five days of vacation in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the trip  Parker uses commission  dollars to pay for the five days of hotel expenses 
4,131,Comment  Parker is violating Standard III A  by not exercising her duty of loyalty  to her clients  She should have determined whether the commissions charged by  SouthAM are reasonable in relation to the benefit of the research provided by the  trip  She also should have determined whether best execution and prices could be  received from SouthAM  In addition the five extra days are not part of the research  effort because they do not assist in the investment decision making  Thus the hotel  expenses for the five days should not be paid for with client assets 
5,131,Example    Excessive Trading  
6,131,Vida Knauss manages the portfolios of a number of high net worth individuals  A major part of  her investment management fee is based on trading commissions  Knauss engages in extensive  trading for each of her clients to ensure that she attains the minimum commission level set by  her firm  Although the securities purchased and sold for the clients are appropriate and fall  within the acceptable asset classes for the clients the amount of trading for each account  exceeds what is necessary to accomplish the client s investment objectives 
7,131,Comment  Knauss has violated Standard III A  because she is using the assets of  her clients to benefit her firm and herself 
8,131,Example    Managing Family Accounts  
9,131,Adam Dill recently joined New Investments Asset Managers  To assist Dill in building a book  of clients both his father and brother opened new fee paying accounts  Dill followed all the  firm s procedures in noting his relationships with these clients and in developing their  investment policy statements 
10,131,After several years the number of Dill s clients has grown but he still manages the original  accounts of his family members  An IPO is coming to market that is a suitable investment for  many of his clients including his brother  Dill does not receive the amount of stock he  requested so to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest he does not allocate any shares to  his brother s account

2,132,Comment  Dill has violated Standard III A  because he is not acting for the benefit  of his brother s account as well as his other accounts  The brother s account is a  regular fee paying account comparable to the accounts of his other clients  By not  allocating the shares proportionately across all accounts for which he thought the  IPO was suitable Dill is disadvantaging specific clients 
3,132,Dill would have been correct in not allocating shares to his brother s account if that  account was being managed outside the normal fee structure of the firm

5,132,Donna Hensley has been hired by a law firm to testify as an expert witness  Although the  testimony is intended to represent impartial advice she is concerned that her work may have  negative consequences for the law firm  If the law firm is Hensley s client how does she ensure  that her testimony will not violate the required duty of loyalty prudence and care to one s  client 
6,132,Comment  In this situation the law firm represents Hensley s employer and the  aspect of  who is the client  is not well defined  When acting as an expert witness  Hensley is bound by the standard of independence and objectivity in the same  manner as an independent research analyst would be bound  Hensley must not let  the law firm influence the testimony she provides in the legal proceedings 
7,132,Example    Identifying the Client  
8,132,Jon Miller is a mutual fund portfolio manager  The fund is focused on the global financial  services sector  Wanda Spears is a private wealth manager in the same city as Miller and is a  friend of Miller  At a local CFA Institute society meeting Spears mentions to Miller that her  new client is an investor in Miller s fund  She states that the two of them now share a  responsibility to this client 
9,132,Comment  Spears  statement is not totally correct  Because she provides the  advisory services to her new client she alone is bound by the duty of loyalty to this  client  Miller s responsibility is to manage the fund according to the investment  policy statement of the fund  His actions should not be influenced by the needs of  any particular fund investor

11,132,After providing client account investment performance to the external facing departments but  prior to it being finalized for release to clients Teresa Nguyen an investment performance  analyst notices the reporting system missed a trade  Correcting the omission resulted in a large  loss for a client that had previously placed the firm on  watch  for potential termination owing  to underperformance in prior periods  Nguyen knows this news is unpleasant but informs the  appropriate individuals that the report needs to be updated before releasing it to the client 
12,132,Comment  Nguyen s actions align with the requirements of Standard III A   Even  though the correction may lead to the firm s termination by the client withholding  information on errors would not be in the best interest of the client

3,133,Baftija Sulejman recently became a candidate in the CFA Program  He is a broker who executes  client directed trades for several high net worth individuals  Sulejman does not provide any  investment advice and only executes the trading decisions made by clients  He is concerned that  the Code and Standards impose a fiduciary duty on him in his dealing with clients and sends an  e mail to the CFA Ethics Helpdesk  ethics cfainstitute org  to seek guidance on this issue 
4,133,Comment  In this instance Sulejman serves in an execution only capacity and his  duty of loyalty prudence and care is centered on the skill and diligence used when  executing trades namely by seeking best execution and making trades within the  parameters set by the clients  instructions on quantity price timing etc    Acting in  the best interests of the client dictates that trades are executed on the most  favorable terms that can be achieved for the client  Given this job function the  requirements of the Code and Standards for loyalty prudence and care clearly do  not impose a fiduciary duty

8,133,Highlights 
9,133,  Investment Recommendations
10,133,  Investment Action
11,133,Standard III B  requires members and candidates to treat all clients fairly when disseminating  investment recommendations or making material changes to prior investment recommendations  or when taking investment action with regard to general purchases new issues or secondary  offerings  Only through the fair treatment of all parties can the investment management  profession maintain the confidence of the investing public 
12,133,When an investment adviser has multiple clients the potential exists for the adviser to favor one  client over another  This favoritism may take various forms from the quality and timing of  services provided to the allocation of investment opportunities

2,134,The term  fairly  implies that the member or candidate must take care not to discriminate  against any clients when disseminating investment recommendations or taking investment  action  Standard III B  does not state  equally  because members and candidates could not  possibly reach all clients at exactly the same time whether by printed mail telephone   including text messaging  computer  including internet updates and e mail distribution   facsimile  fax  or wire  Each client has unique needs investment criteria and investment  objectives so not all investment opportunities are suitable for all clients  In addition members  and candidates may provide more personal specialized or in depth service to clients who are  willing to pay for premium services through higher management fees or higher levels of  brokerage  Members and candidates may differentiate their services to clients but different  levels of service must not disadvantage or negatively affect clients  In addition the different  service levels should be disclosed to clients and prospective clients and should be available to  everyone  i e  different service levels should not be offered selectively  
3,134,Standard III B  covers conduct in two broadly defined categories investment  recommendations and investment action 
4,134,Investment Recommendations
5,134,The first category of conduct involves members and candidates whose primary function is the  preparation of investment recommendations to be disseminated either to the public or within a  firm for the use of others in making investment decisions  This group includes members and  candidates employed by investment counseling advisory or consulting firms as well as banks  brokerage firms and insurance companies  The criterion is that the member s or candidate s  primary responsibility is the preparation of recommendations to be acted on by others including  those in the member s or candidate s organization 
6,134,An investment recommendation is any opinion expressed by a member or candidate in regard to  purchasing selling or holding a given security or other investment  The opinion may be  disseminated to customers or clients through an initial detailed research report through a brief  update report by addition to or deletion from a list of recommended securities or simply by  oral communication  A recommendation that is distributed to anyone outside the organization is  considered a communication for general distribution under Standard III B  
7,134,Standard III B  addresses the manner in which investment recommendations or changes in prior  recommendations are disseminated to clients  Each member or candidate is obligated to ensure  that information is disseminated in such a manner that all clients have a fair opportunity to act  on every recommendation  Communicating with all clients on a uniform basis presents practical  problems for members and candidates because of differences in timing and methods of  communication with various types of customers and clients  Members and candidates should  encourage their firms to design an equitable system to prevent selective or discriminatory  disclosure and should inform clients about what kind of communications they will receive 
8,134,The duty to clients imposed by Standard III B  may be more critical when members or  candidates change their recommendations than when they make initial recommendations   Material changes in a member s or candidate s prior investment recommendations because of  subsequent research should be communicated to all current clients  particular care should be  taken that the information reaches those clients who the member or candidate knows have acted  on or been affected by the earlier advice  Clients who do not know that the member or candidate  has changed a recommendation and who therefore place orders contrary to a current  recommendation should be advised of the changed recommendation before the order is  accepted

2,135,Investment Action
3,135,The second category of conduct includes those members and candidates whose primary  function is taking investment action  portfolio management  on the basis of recommendations  prepared internally or received from external sources  Investment action like investment  recommendations can affect market value  Consequently Standard III B  requires that  members or candidates treat all clients fairly in light of their investment objectives and  circumstances  For example when making investments in new offerings or in secondary  financings members and candidates should distribute the issues to all customers for whom the  investments are appropriate in a manner consistent with the policies of the firm for allocating  blocks of stock  If the issue is oversubscribed then the issue should be prorated to all  subscribers  This action should be taken on a round lot basis to avoid odd lot distributions  In  addition if the issue is oversubscribed members and candidates should forgo any sales to  themselves or their immediate families in order to free up additional shares for clients  If the  investment professional s family member accounts are managed similarly to the accounts of  other clients of the firm however the family member accounts should not be excluded from  buying such shares 
4,135,Members and candidates must make every effort to treat all individual and institutional clients  in a fair and impartial manner  A member or candidate may have multiple relationships with an  institution  for example the member or candidate may be a corporate trustee pension fund  manager manager of funds for individuals employed by the customer loan originator or  creditor  A member or candidate must exercise care to treat all clients fairly 
5,135,Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients the documented  allocation procedures they or their firms have in place and how the procedures would affect the  client or prospect  The disclosure should be clear and complete so that the client can make an  informed investment decision  Even when complete disclosure is made however members and  candidates must put client interests ahead of their own  A member s or candidate s duty of  fairness and loyalty to clients can never be overridden by client consent to patently unfair  allocation procedures 
6,135,Treating clients fairly also means that members and candidates should not take advantage of  their position in the industry to the detriment of clients  For instance in the context of IPOs  members and candidates must make bona fide public distributions of  hot issue  securities   defined as securities of a public offering that are trading at a premium in the secondary market  whenever such trading commences because of the great demand for the securities   Members  and candidates are prohibited from withholding such securities for their own benefit and must  not use such securities as a reward or incentive to gain benefit

2,136,Develop Firm Policies
3,136,Although Standard III B  refers to a member s or candidate s responsibility to deal fairly and  objectively with clients members and candidates should also encourage their firms to establish  compliance procedures requiring all employees who disseminate investment recommendations  or take investment actions to treat customers and clients fairly  At the very least a member or  candidate should recommend appropriate procedures to management if none are in place  And  the member or candidate should make management aware of possible violations of fair dealing  practices within the firm when they come to the attention of the member or candidate 
4,136,The extent of the formality and complexity of such compliance procedures depends on the  nature and size of the organization and the type of securities involved  An investment adviser  who is a sole proprietor and handles only discretionary accounts might not disseminate  recommendations to the public but that adviser should have formal written procedures to  ensure that all clients receive fair investment action 
5,136,Good business practice dictates that initial recommendations be made available to all customers  who indicate an interest  Although a member or candidate need not communicate a  recommendation to all customers the selection process by which customers receive information  should be based on suitability and known interest not on any preferred or favored status  A  common practice to assure fair dealing is to communicate recommendations simultaneously  within the firm and to customers 
6,136,Members and candidates should consider the following points when establishing fair dealing  compliance procedures 
7,136,  Limit the number of people involved  Members and candidates should make reasonable  efforts to limit the number of people who are privy to the fact that a recommendation is  going to be disseminated 
8,136,  Shorten the time frame between decision and dissemination  Members and candidates  should make reasonable efforts to limit the amount of time that elapses between the  decision to make an investment recommendation and the time the actual recommendation  is disseminated  If a detailed institutional recommendation that might take two or three  weeks to publish is in preparation a short summary report including the conclusion might  be published in advance  In an organization where both a research committee and an  investment policy committee must approve a recommendation the meetings should be  held on the same day if possible  The process of reviewing reports and printing and  mailing them faxing them or distributing them by e mail necessarily involves the  passage of time sometimes long periods of time  In large firms with extensive review  processes the time factor is usually not within the control of the analyst who prepares the  report  Thus many firms and their analysts communicate to customers and firm personnel  the new or changed recommendations by an update or  flash  report  The communication  technique might be fax e mail wire or short written report 
9,136,  Publish guidelines for pre dissemination behavior  Members and candidates should  encourage firms to develop guidelines that prohibit personnel who have prior knowledge  of an investment recommendation from discussing or taking any action on the pending  recommendation

2,137,  Simultaneous dissemination  Members and candidates should establish procedures for the  timing of dissemination of investment recommendations so that all clients are treated  fairly that is are informed at approximately the same time  For example if a firm is  going to announce a new recommendation supervisory personnel should time the  announcement to avoid placing any client or group of clients at an unfair advantage  relative to other clients  A communication to all branch offices should be sent at the time  of the general announcement   When appropriate the firm should accompany the  announcement of a new recommendation with a statement that trading restrictions for the  firm s employees are now in effect  The trading restrictions should stay in effect until the  recommendation is widely distributed to all relevant clients   Once this distribution has  occurred the member or candidate may follow up separately with individual clients but  members and candidates should not give favored clients advance information when such  advance notification may disadvantage other clients 
3,137,  Maintain a list of clients and their holdings  Members and candidates should maintain a  list of all clients and the securities or other investments each client holds in order to  facilitate notification of customers or clients of a change in an investment  recommendation  If a particular security or other investment is to be sold such a list can  be used to ensure that all holders are treated fairly in the liquidation of that particular  investment 
4,137,  Develop and document trade allocation procedures  When formulating procedures for  allocating trades members and candidates should develop a set of guiding principles that  ensure
5,137,  fairness to advisory clients both in priority of execution of orders and in the  allocation of the price obtained in execution of block orders or trades
6,137,  timeliness and efficiency in the execution of orders and
7,137,  accuracy of the member s or candidate s records as to trade orders and client  account positions 
8,137,With these principles in mind members and candidates should develop or encourage their firm  to develop written allocation procedures with particular attention to procedures for block trades  and new issues  Procedures to consider are as follows 
9,137,  requiring orders and modifications or cancellations of orders to be documented and time  stamped 
10,137,  processing and executing orders on a first in first out basis with consideration of  bundling orders for efficiency as appropriate for the asset class or the security 
11,137,  developing a policy to address such issues as calculating execution prices and  partial  fills  when trades are grouped or in a block for efficiency 
12,137,  giving all client accounts participating in a block trade the same execution price and  charging the same commission 
13,137,  when the full amount of the block order is not executed allocating partially executed  orders among the participating client accounts pro rata on the basis of order size while not  going below an established minimum lot size for some securities  e g  bonds   and

2,138,  when allocating trades for new issues obtaining advance indications of interest  allocating securities by client  rather than portfolio manager  and providing a method for  calculating allocations 
3,138,Disclose Trade Allocation Procedures
4,138,Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients how they select  accounts to participate in an order and how they determine the amount of securities each  account will buy or sell  Trade allocation procedures must be fair and equitable and disclosure  of inequitable allocation methods does not relieve the member or candidate of this obligation 
5,138,Establish Systematic Account Review
6,138,Member and candidate supervisors should review each account on a regular basis to ensure that  no client or customer is being given preferential treatment and that the investment actions taken  for each account are suitable for each account s objectives  Because investments should be  based on individual needs and circumstances an investment manager may have good reasons  for placing a given security or other investment in one account while selling it from another  account and should fully document the reasons behind both sides of the transaction  Members  and candidates should encourage firms to establish review procedures however to detect  whether trading in one account is being used to benefit a favored client 
7,138,Disclose Levels of Service
8,138,Members and candidates should disclose to all clients whether the organization offers different  levels of service to clients for the same fee or different fees  Different levels of service should  not be offered to clients selectively

11,138,Bradley Ames a well known and respected analyst follows the computer industry  In the  course of his research he finds that a small relatively unknown company whose shares are  traded over the counter has just signed significant contracts with some of the companies he  follows  After a considerable amount of investigation Ames decides to write a research report  on the small company and recommend purchase of its shares  While the report is being  reviewed by the company for factual accuracy Ames schedules a luncheon with several of his  best clients to discuss the company  At the luncheon he mentions the purchase recommendation  scheduled to be sent early the following week to all the firm s clients 
12,138,Comment  Ames has violated Standard III B  by disseminating the purchase  recommendation to the clients with whom he has lunch a week before the  recommendation is sent to all clients

2,139,Example    Fair Dealing between Funds  
3,139,Spencer Rivers president of XYZ Corporation moves his company s growth oriented pension  fund to a particular bank primarily because of the excellent investment performance achieved  by the bank s commingled fund for the prior five year period  Later Rivers compares the  results of his pension fund with those of the bank s commingled fund  He is startled to learn  that even though the two accounts have the same investment objectives and similar portfolios  his company s pension fund has significantly underperformed the bank s commingled fund   Questioning this result at his next meeting with the pension fund s manager Rivers is told that  as a matter of policy when a new security is placed on the recommended list Morgan Jackson  the pension fund manager first purchases the security for the commingled account and then  purchases it on a pro rata basis for all other pension fund accounts  Similarly when a sale is  recommended the security is sold first from the commingled account and then sold on a pro  rata basis from all other accounts  Rivers also learns that if the bank cannot get enough shares   especially of hot issues  to be meaningful to all the accounts its policy is to place the new  issues only in the commingled account 
4,139,Seeing that Rivers is neither satisfied nor pleased by the explanation Jackson quickly adds that  nondiscretionary pension accounts and personal trust accounts have a lower priority on  purchase and sale recommendations than discretionary pension fund accounts  Furthermore  Jackson states the company s pension fund had the opportunity to invest up to    in the  commingled fund 
5,139,Comment  The bank s policy does not treat all customers fairly and Jackson has  violated her duty to her clients by giving priority to the growth oriented  commingled fund over all other funds and to discretionary accounts over  nondiscretionary accounts  Jackson must execute orders on a systematic basis that  is fair to all clients  In addition trade allocation procedures should be disclosed to  all clients when they become clients  Of course in this case disclosure of the  bank s policy would not change the fact that the policy is unfair

7,139,Dominic Morris works for a small regional securities firm  His work consists of corporate  finance activities and investing for institutional clients  Arena Ltd  is planning to go public   The partners have secured rights to buy an arena football league franchise and are planning to  use the funds from the issue to complete the purchase  Because arena football is the current  rage Morris believes he has a hot issue on his hands  He has quietly negotiated some options  for himself for helping convince Arena to do the financing through his securities firm  When he  seeks expressions of interest the institutional buyers oversubscribe the issue  Morris assuming  that the institutions have the financial clout to drive the stock up then fills all orders  including  his own  and decreases the institutional blocks 
8,139,Comment  Morris has violated Standard III B  by not treating all customers fairly   He should not have taken any shares himself and should have prorated the shares  offered among all clients  In addition he should have disclosed to his firm and to  his clients that he received options as part of the deal  see Standard VI A   Disclosure of Conflicts

4,140,Comment  Preston has violated Standard III B  by failing to deal fairly with her  clients in taking these investment actions  Preston should have allocated the trades  prior to executing the orders or she should have had a systematic approach to  allocating the trades such as pro rata as soon as practical after they were executed   Among other things Preston must disclose to the client that the adviser may act as  broker for receive commissions from and have a potential conflict of interest  regarding both parties in agency cross transactions  After the disclosure she should  obtain from the client consent authorizing such transactions in advance

3,141,Lynn Hampton is a well respected private wealth manager in her community with a diversified  client base  She determines that a new    year bond being offered by Healthy Pharmaceuticals  is appropriate for five of her clients  Three clients request to purchase US       each and the  other two request US       each  The minimum lot size is established at US      and the  issue is oversubscribed at the time of placement  Her firm s policy is that odd lot allocations  especially those below the minimum should be avoided because they may affect the liquidity of  the security at the time of sale 
4,141,Hampton is informed she will receive only US       of the offering for all accounts  Hampton  distributes the bond investments as follows  The three accounts that requested US       are  allocated US      each and the two accounts that requested US       are allocated  US       each 
5,141,Comment  Hampton has not violated Standard III B  even though the distribution  is not on a completely pro rata basis because of the required minimum lot size   With the total allocation being significantly below the amount requested Hampton  ensured that each client received at least the minimum lot size of the issue  This  approach allowed the clients to efficiently sell the bond later if necessary

8,141,Comment  Chan is violating Standard III B  because his trading actions are  disadvantaging his clients to enhance a relationship with a preferred client  All  clients are benefiting from the research being provided and should incur their fair  portion of the costs  This does not mean that additional trading should occur if a  client has not paid an equal portion of the commission  trading should occur only as  required by the strategy

6,142,Paul Rove performance analyst for Alpha Beta Investment Management is describing to the  firm s chief investment officer  CIO  two new reports he would like to develop to assist the  firm in meeting its obligations to treat clients fairly  Because many of the firm s clients have  similar investment objectives and portfolios Rove suggests a report detailing securities owned  across several clients and the percentage of the portfolio the security represents  The second  report would compare the monthly performance of portfolios with similar strategies  The  outliers within each report would be submitted to the CIO for review 
7,142,Comment  As a performance analyst Rove likely has little direct contact with  clients and thus has limited opportunity to treat clients differently  The  recommended reports comply with Standard III B  while helping the firm conduct  after the fact reviews of how effectively the firm s advisers are dealing with their  clients  portfolios  Reports that monitor the fair treatment of clients are an  important oversight tool to ensure that clients are treated fairly

10,143,  Managing to an Index or Mandate
11,143,Standard III C  requires that members and candidates who are in an investment advisory  relationship with clients consider carefully the needs circumstances and objectives of the  clients when determining the appropriateness and suitability of a given investment or course of  investment action  An appropriate suitability determination will not however prevent some  investments or investment actions from losing value 
12,143,In judging the suitability of a potential investment the member or candidate should review  many aspects of the client s knowledge experience related to investing and financial situation   These aspects include but are not limited to the risk profile of the investment as compared with  the constraints of the client the impact of the investment on the diversity of the portfolio and  whether the client has the means or net worth to assume the associated risk  The investment  professional s determination of suitability should reflect only the investment recommendations  or actions that a prudent person would be willing to undertake  Not every investment  opportunity will be suitable for every portfolio regardless of the potential return being offered 
13,143,The responsibilities of members and candidates to gather information and make a suitability  analysis prior to making a recommendation or taking investment action fall on those members  and candidates who provide investment advice in the course of an advisory relationship with a  client  Other members and candidates may be simply executing specific instructions for retail  clients when buying or selling securities such as shares in mutual funds  These members and  candidates and some others such as sell side analysts may not have the opportunity to judge  the suitability of a particular investment for the ultimate client

2,144,Developing an Investment Policy
3,144,When an advisory relationship exists members and candidates must gather client information at  the inception of the relationship  Such information includes the client s financial circumstances  personal data  such as age and occupation  that are relevant to investment decisions attitudes  toward risk and objectives in investing  This information should be incorporated into a written  investment policy statement  IPS  that addresses the client s risk tolerance return requirements  and all investment constraints  including time horizon liquidity needs tax concerns legal and  regulatory factors and unique circumstances   Without identifying such client factors members  and candidates cannot judge whether a particular investment or strategy is suitable for a  particular client  The IPS also should identify and describe the roles and responsibilities of the  parties to the advisory relationship and investment process as well as schedules for review and  evaluation of the IPS  After formulating long term capital market expectations members and  candidates can assist in developing an appropriate strategic asset allocation and investment  program for the client whether these are presented in separate documents or incorporated in the  IPS or in appendices to the IPS 
4,144,Understanding the Client s Risk Profile
5,144,One of the most important factors to be considered in matching appropriateness and suitability  of an investment with a client s needs and circumstances is measuring that client s tolerance for  risk  The investment professional must consider the possibilities of rapidly changing investment  environments and their likely impact on a client s holdings both individual securities and the  collective portfolio  The risk of many investment strategies can and should be analyzed and  quantified in advance 
6,144,The use of synthetic investment vehicles and derivative investment products has introduced  particular issues of risk  Members and candidates should pay careful attention to the leverage  inherent in many of these vehicles or products when considering them for use in a client s  investment program  Such leverage and limited liquidity depending on the degree to which  they are hedged bear directly on the issue of suitability for the client 
7,144,Updating an Investment Policy
8,144,Updating the IPS should be repeated at least annually and also prior to material changes to any  specific investment recommendations or decisions on behalf of the client  The effort to  determine the needs and circumstances of each client is not a one time occurrence  Investment  recommendations or decisions are usually part of an ongoing process that takes into account the  diversity and changing nature of portfolio and client characteristics  The passage of time is  bound to produce changes that are important with respect to investment objectives 
9,144,For an individual client important changes might include the number of dependents personal  tax status health liquidity needs risk tolerance amount of wealth beyond that represented in  the portfolio and extent to which compensation and other income provide for current income  needs  With respect to an institutional client such changes might relate to the magnitude of  unfunded liabilities in a pension fund the withdrawal privileges in an employee savings plan or  the distribution requirements of a charitable foundation  Without efforts to update information  concerning client factors one or more factors could change without the investment manager s  knowledge

2,145,Suitability review can be done most effectively when the client fully discloses his or her  complete financial portfolio including those portions not managed by the member or candidate   If clients withhold information about their financial portfolios the suitability analysis conducted  by members and candidates cannot be expected to be complete  it must be based on the  information provided 
3,145,The Need for Diversification
4,145,The investment profession has long recognized that combining several different investments is  likely to provide a more acceptable level of risk exposure than having all assets in a single  investment  The unique characteristics  or risks  of an individual investment may become  partially or entirely neutralized when it is combined with other individual investments within a  portfolio  Some reasonable amount of diversification is thus the norm for many portfolios  especially those managed by individuals or institutions that have some degree of legal fiduciary  responsibility 
5,145,An investment with high relative risk on its own may be a suitable investment in the context of  the entire portfolio or when the client s stated objectives contemplate speculative or risky  investments  The manager may be responsible for only a portion of the client s total portfolio  or the client may not have provided a full financial picture  Members and candidates can be  responsible for assessing the suitability of an investment only on the basis of the information  and criteria actually provided by the client 
6,145,Addressing Unsolicited Trading Requests
7,145,Members and candidates may receive requests from a client for trades that do not properly align  with the risk and return objectives outlined in the client s investment policy statement  These  transaction requests may be based on the client s individual biases or professional experience   Members and candidates will need to make reasonable efforts to balance their clients  trading  requests with their responsibilities to follow the agreed on investment policy statement 
8,145,In cases of unsolicited trade requests that a member or candidate knows are unsuitable for a  client the member or candidate should refrain from making the trade until he or she discusses  the concerns with the client  The discussions and resulting actions may encompass a variety of  scenarios depending on how the requested unsuitable investment relates to the client s full  portfolio 
9,145,Many times an unsolicited request may be expected to have only a minimum impact on the  entire portfolio because the size of the requested trade is small or the trade would result in a  limited change to the portfolio s risk profile  In discussing the trade the member or candidate  should focus on educating the investor on how the request deviates from the current policy  statement  Following the discussion the member or candidate may follow his or her firm s  policies regarding the necessary client approval for executing unsuitable trades  At a minimum  the client should acknowledge the discussion and accept the conditions that make the  recommendation unsuitable 
10,145,Should the unsolicited request be expected to have a material impact on the portfolio the  member or candidate should use this opportunity to update the investment policy statement   Doing so would allow the client to fully understand the potential effect of the requested trade on  his or her current goals or risk levels

2,146,Members and candidates may have some clients who decline to modify their policy statements  while insisting an unsolicited trade be made  In such instances members or candidates will need  to evaluate the effectiveness of their services to the client  The options available to the members  or candidates will depend on the services provided by their employer  Some firms may allow  for the trade to be executed in a new unmanaged account  If alternative options are not  available members and candidates ultimately will need to determine whether they should  continue the advisory arrangement with the client 
3,146,Managing to an Index or Mandate
4,146,Some members and candidates do not manage money for individuals but are responsible for  managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate  The responsibility of these members and  candidates is to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate  For example a member  or candidate who serves as the fund manager for a large cap income fund would not be  following the fund mandate by investing heavily in small cap or start up companies whose  stock is speculative in nature  Members and candidates who manage pooled assets to a specific  mandate are not responsible for determining the suitability of the fund as an investment for  investors who may be purchasing shares in the fund  The responsibility for determining the  suitability of an investment for clients can be conferred only on members and candidates who  have an advisory relationship with clients 
5,146,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
6,146,Investment Policy Statement
7,146,To fulfill the basic provisions of Standard III C  a member or candidate should put the needs  and circumstances of each client and the client s investment objectives into a written investment  policy statement  In formulating an investment policy for the client the member or candidate  should take the following into consideration 
8,146,  client identification     type and nature of client     the existence of separate  beneficiaries and     approximate portion of total client assets that the member or  candidate is managing 
9,146,  investor objectives     return objectives  income growth in principal maintenance of  purchasing power  and     risk tolerance  suitability stability of values  
10,146,  investor constraints     liquidity needs     expected cash flows  patterns of additions  and or withdrawals      investable funds  assets and liabilities or other commitments       time horizon     tax considerations     regulatory and legal circumstances      investor preferences prohibitions circumstances and unique needs and     proxy voting  responsibilities and guidance  and

2,147,Regular Updates
3,147,The investor s objectives and constraints should be maintained and reviewed periodically to  reflect any changes in the client s circumstances  Members and candidates should regularly  compare client constraints with capital market expectations to arrive at an appropriate asset  allocation  Changes in either factor may result in a fundamental change in asset allocation   Annual review is reasonable unless business or other reasons such as a major change in market  conditions dictate more frequent review  Members and candidates should document attempts to  carry out such a review if circumstances prevent it 
4,147,Suitability Test Policies
5,147,With the increase in regulatory required suitability tests members and candidates should  encourage their firms to develop related policies and procedures  The procedures will differ  according to the size of the firm and the scope of the services offered to its clients 
6,147,The test procedures should require the investment professional to look beyond the potential  return of the investment and include the following 
7,147,  an analysis of the impact on the portfolio s diversification
8,147,  a comparison of the investment risks with the client s assessed risk tolerance and
9,147,  the fit of the investment with the required investment strategy 
10,147,Application of the Standard
11,147,Example    Investment Suitability Risk Profile  
12,147,Caleb Smith an investment adviser has two clients  Larry Robertson    years old and Gabriel  Lanai    years old  Both clients earn roughly the same salary but Robertson has a much higher  risk tolerance because he has a large asset base  Robertson is willing to invest part of his assets  very aggressively  Lanai wants only to achieve a steady rate of return with low volatility to pay  for his children s education  Smith recommends investing     of both portfolios in zero yield  small cap high technology equity issues 
13,147,Comment  In Robertson s case the investment may be appropriate because of his  financial circumstances and aggressive investment position but this investment is  not suitable for Lanai  Smith is violating Standard III C  by applying Robertson s  investment strategy to Lanai because the two clients  financial circumstances and  objectives differ

2,148,Example    Investment Suitability Entire Portfolio  
3,148,Jessica McDowell an investment adviser suggests to Brian Crosby a risk averse client that  covered call options be used in his equity portfolio  The purpose would be to enhance Crosby s  income and partially offset any untimely depreciation in the portfolio s value should the stock  market or other circumstances affect his holdings unfavorably  McDowell educates Crosby  about all possible outcomes including the risk of incurring an added tax liability if a stock rises  in price and is called away and conversely the risk of his holdings losing protection on the  downside if prices drop sharply 
4,148,Comment  When determining suitability of an investment the primary focus should  be the characteristics of the client s entire portfolio not the characteristics of single  securities on an issue by issue basis  The basic characteristics of the entire portfolio  will largely determine whether investment recommendations are taking client  factors into account  Therefore the most important aspects of a particular  investment are those that will affect the characteristics of the total portfolio  In this  case McDowell properly considers the investment in the context of the entire  portfolio and thoroughly explains the investment to the client 
5,148,Example    IPS Updating  
6,148,In a regular meeting with client Seth Jones the portfolio managers at Blue Chip Investment  Advisors are careful to allow some time to review his current needs and circumstances  In doing  so they learn that some significant changes have recently taken place in his life  A wealthy  uncle left Jones an inheritance that increased his net worth fourfold to US   million 
7,148,Comment  The inheritance has significantly increased Jones s ability  and possibly  his willingness  to assume risk and has diminished the average yield required to  meet his current income needs  Jones s financial circumstances have definitely  changed so Blue Chip managers must update Jones s investment policy statement  to reflect how his investment objectives have changed  Accordingly the Blue Chip  portfolio managers should consider a somewhat higher equity ratio for his portfolio  than was called for by the previous circumstances and the managers  specific  common stock recommendations might be heavily tilted toward low yield growth  oriented issues

9,148,Louis Perkowski manages a high income mutual fund  He purchases zero dividend stock in a  financial services company because he believes the stock is undervalued and is in a potential  growth industry which makes it an attractive investment 
10,148,Comment  A zero dividend stock does not seem to fit the mandate of the fund that  Perkowski is managing  Unless Perkowski s investment fits within the mandate or  is within the realm of allowable investments the fund has made clear in its  disclosures Perkowski has violated Standard III C

3,149,Max Gubler chief investment officer of a property casualty insurance subsidiary of a large  financial conglomerate wants to improve the diversification of the subsidiary s investment  portfolio and increase its returns  The subsidiary s investment policy statement provides for  highly liquid investments such as large cap equities and government supranational and  corporate bonds with a minimum credit rating of AA and maturity of no more than five years   In a recent presentation a venture capital group offered very attractive prospective returns on  some of its private equity funds that provide seed capital to ventures  An exit strategy was  already contemplated but investors would have to observe a minimum three year lockup period  and a subsequent laddered exit option for a maximum of one third of their shares per year   Gubler does not want to miss this opportunity  After extensive analysis with the intent to  optimize the return on the equity assets within the subsidiary s current portfolio he invests     in this seed fund leaving the portfolio s total equity exposure still well below its upper limit 
4,149,Comment  Gubler is violating Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and Care as well  as Standard III C   His new investment locks up part of the subsidiary s assets for  at least three years and up to as many as five years and possibly beyond  The IPS  requires investments in highly liquid investments and describes accepted asset  classes  private equity investments with a lockup period certainly do not qualify   Even without a lockup period an asset class with only an occasional and thus  implicitly illiquid market may not be suitable for the portfolio  Although an IPS  typically describes objectives and constraints in great detail the manager must also  make every effort to understand the client s business and circumstances  Doing so  should enable the manager to recognize understand and discuss with the client  other factors that may be or may become material in the investment management  process 
5,149,Example    Submanager and IPS Reviews  
6,149,Paul Ostrowski s investment management business has grown significantly over the past couple  of years and some clients want to diversify internationally  Ostrowski decides to find a  submanager to handle the expected international investments  Because this will be his first  subadviser Ostrowski uses the CFA Institute model  request for proposal  to design a  questionnaire for his search  By his deadline he receives seven completed questionnaires from  a variety of domestic and international firms trying to gain his business  Ostrowski reviews all  the applications in detail and decides to select the firm that charges the lowest fees because  doing so will have the least impact on his firm s bottom line 
7,149,Comment  When selecting an external manager or subadviser Ostrowski needs to  ensure that the new manager s services are appropriate for his clients  This due  diligence includes comparing the risk profile of the clients with the investment  strategy of the manager  In basing the decision on the fee structure alone  Ostrowski may be violating Standard III C  
8,149,When clients ask to diversify into international products it is an appropriate time to  review and update the clients  IPSs  Ostrowski s review may determine that the  risk of international investments modifies the risk profiles of the clients or does not  represent an appropriate investment

3,150,Samantha Snead a portfolio manager for Thomas Investment Counsel Inc  specializes in  managing public retirement funds and defined benefit pension plan accounts all of which have  long term investment objectives  A year ago Snead s employer in an attempt to motivate and  retain key investment professionals introduced a bonus compensation system that rewards  portfolio managers on the basis of quarterly performance relative to their peers and to certain  benchmark indexes  In an attempt to improve the short term performance of her accounts  Snead changes her investment strategy and purchases several high beta stocks for client  portfolios  These purchases are seemingly contrary to the clients  investment policy statements   Following their purchase an officer of Griffin Corporation one of Snead s pension fund clients  asks why Griffin Corporation s portfolio seems to be dominated by high beta stocks of  companies that often appear among the most actively traded issues  No change in objective or  strategy has been recommended by Snead during the year 
4,150,Comment  Snead violated Standard III C  by investing the clients  assets in high  beta stocks  These high risk investments are contrary to the long term risk profile  established in the clients  IPSs  Snead has changed the investment strategy of the  clients in an attempt to reap short term rewards offered by her firm s new  compensation arrangement not in response to changes in clients  investment policy  statements

7,150,Andre Shrub owns and operates Conduit an investment advisory firm  Prior to opening  Conduit Shrub was an account manager with Elite Investment a hedge fund managed by his  good friend Adam Reed  To attract clients to a new Conduit fund Shrub offers lower than  normal management fees  He can do so because the fund consists of two top performing funds  managed by Reed  Given his personal friendship with Reed and the prior performance record of  these two funds Shrub believes this new fund is a winning combination for all parties  Clients  quickly invest with Conduit to gain access to the Elite funds  No one is turned away because  Conduit is seeking to expand its assets under management 
8,150,Comment  Shrub has violated Standard III C  because the risk profile of the new  fund may not be suitable for every client  As an investment adviser Shrub needs to  establish an investment policy statement for each client and recommend only  investments that match each client s risk and return profile in the IPS  Shrub is  required to act as more than a simple sales agent for Elite 
9,150,Although Shrub cannot disobey the direct request of a client to purchase a specific  security he should fully discuss the risks of a planned purchase and provide  reasons why it might not be suitable for a client  This requirement may lead  members and candidates to decline new customers if those customers  requested  investment decisions are significantly out of line with their stated requirements

2,151,Standard III D  Performance Presentation
3,151,When communicating investment performance information Members and Candidates  must make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is fair accurate and complete 
4,151,Guidance
5,151,Standard III D  requires members and candidates to provide credible performance information  to clients and prospective clients and to avoid misstating performance or misleading clients and  prospective clients about the investment performance of members or candidates or their firms   This standard encourages full disclosure of investment performance data to clients and  prospective clients 
6,151,Standard III D  covers any practice that would lead to misrepresentation of a member s or  candidate s performance record whether the practice involves performance presentation or  performance measurement  This standard prohibits misrepresentations of past performance or  reasonably expected performance  A member or candidate must give a fair and complete  presentation of performance information whenever communicating data with respect to the  performance history of individual accounts composites or groups of accounts or composites of  an analyst s or firm s performance results  Furthermore members and candidates should not  state or imply that clients will obtain or benefit from a rate of return that was generated in the  past 
7,151,The requirements of this standard are not limited to members and candidates managing separate  accounts  Whenever a member or candidate provides performance information for which the  manager is claiming responsibility such as for pooled funds the history must be accurate   Research analysts promoting the success or accuracy of their recommendations must ensure that  their claims are fair accurate and complete 
8,151,If the presentation is brief the member or candidate must make available to clients and  prospects on request the detailed information supporting that communication  Best practice  dictates that brief presentations include a reference to the limited nature of the information  provided 
9,151,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
10,151,Apply the GIPS Standards
11,151,For members and candidates who are showing the performance history of the assets they  manage compliance with the GIPS standards is the best method to meet their obligations under  Standard III D   Members and candidates should encourage their firms to comply with the GIPS  standards

2,152,Compliance without Applying GIPS Standards
3,152,Members and candidates can also meet their obligations under Standard III D  by
4,152,  considering the knowledge and sophistication of the audience to whom a performance  presentation is addressed
5,152,  presenting the performance of the weighted composite of similar portfolios rather than  using a single representative account
6,152,  including terminated accounts as part of performance history with a clear indication of  when the accounts were terminated
7,152,  including disclosures that fully explain the performance results being reported  for  example stating when appropriate that results are simulated when model results are  used clearly indicating when the performance record is that of a prior entity or  disclosing whether the performance is gross of fees net of fees or after tax  and
8,152,  maintaining the data and records used to calculate the performance being presented

11,152,Kyle Taylor of Taylor Trust Company noting the performance of Taylor s common trust fund  for the past two years states in a brochure sent to his potential clients  You can expect steady      annual compound growth of the value of your investments over the year   Taylor Trust s  common trust fund did increase at the rate of     per year for the past year which mirrored the  increase of the entire market  The fund has never averaged that growth for more than one year  however and the average rate of growth of all of its trust accounts for five years is    per year 
12,152,Comment  Taylor s brochure is in violation of Standard III D   Taylor should have  disclosed that the     growth occurred only in one year  Additionally Taylor did  not include client accounts other than those in the firm s common trust fund  A  general claim of firm performance should take into account the performance of all  categories of accounts  Finally by stating that clients can expect a steady      annual compound growth rate Taylor is also violating Standard I C   Misrepresentation which prohibits assurances or guarantees regarding an  investment

4,153,Aaron McCoy is vice president and managing partner of the equity investment group of  Mastermind Financial Advisors a new business  Mastermind recruited McCoy because he had a  proven six year track record with G P Financial  In developing Mastermind s advertising and  marketing campaign McCoy prepares an advertisement that includes the equity investment  performance he achieved at G P Financial  The advertisement for Mastermind does not  identify the equity performance as being earned while at G P  The advertisement is distributed  to existing clients and prospective clients of Mastermind 
5,153,Comment  McCoy has violated Standard III D  by distributing an advertisement  that contains material misrepresentations about the historical performance of  Mastermind  Standard III D  requires that members and candidates make every  reasonable effort to ensure that performance information is a fair accurate and  complete representation of an individual s or firm s performance  As a general  matter this standard does not prohibit showing past performance of funds managed  at a prior firm as part of a performance track record as long as showing that record  is accompanied by appropriate disclosures about where the performance took place  and the person s specific role in achieving that performance  If McCoy chooses to  use his past performance from G P in Mastermind s advertising he should make  full disclosure of the source of the historical performance

8,153,Comment  Davis violated Standard III D  by failing to clearly identify simulated  performance results  Standard III D  prohibits members and candidates from  making any statements that misrepresent the performance achieved by them or their  firms and requires members and candidates to make every reasonable effort to  ensure that performance information presented to clients is fair accurate and  complete  Use of simulated results should be accompanied by full disclosure as to  the source of the performance data including the fact that the results from       through      were the result of applying the model retroactively to that time  period

3,154,In a presentation prepared for prospective clients William Kilmer shows the rates of return  realized over a five year period by a  composite  of his firm s discretionary accounts that have  a  balanced  objective  This composite however consisted of only a few of the accounts that  met the balanced criterion set by the firm excluded accounts under a certain asset level without  disclosing the fact of their exclusion and included accounts that did not have the balanced  mandate because those accounts would boost the investment results  In addition to achieve  better results Kilmer manipulated the narrow range of accounts included in the composite by  changing the accounts that made up the composite over time 
4,154,Comment  Kilmer violated Standard III D  by misrepresenting the facts in the  promotional material sent to prospective clients distorting his firm s performance  record and failing to include disclosures that would have clarified the presentation 
5,154,Example    Performance Attribution Changes  
6,154,Art Purell is reviewing the quarterly performance attribution reports for distribution to clients   Purell works for an investment management firm with a bottom up fundamentals driven  investment process that seeks to add value through stock selection  The attribution methodology  currently compares each stock with its sector  The attribution report indicates that the value  added this quarter came from asset allocation and that stock selection contributed negatively to  the calculated return 
7,154,Through running several different scenarios Purell discovers that calculating attribution by  comparing each stock with its industry and then rolling the effect to the sector level improves  the appearance of the manager s stock selection activities  Because the firm defines the  attribution terms and the results better reflect the stated strategy Purell recommends that the  client reports should use the revised methodology 
8,154,Comment  Modifying the attribution methodology without proper notifications to  clients would fail to meet the requirements of Standard III D   Purrell s  recommendation is being done solely for the interest of the firm to improve its  perceived ability to meet the stated investment strategy  Such changes are unfair to  clients and obscure the facts regarding the firm s abilities 
9,154,Had Purell believed the new methodology offered improvements to the original  model then he would have needed to report the results of both calculations to the  client  The report should also include the reasons why the new methodology is  preferred which would allow the client to make a meaningful comparison to prior  results and provide a basis for comparing future attributions

2,156,Standard III E  requires that members and candidates preserve the confidentiality of  information communicated to them by their clients prospective clients and former clients  This  standard is applicable when     the member or candidate receives information because of his or  her special ability to conduct a portion of the client s business or personal affairs and     the  member or candidate receives information that arises from or is relevant to that portion of the  client s business that is the subject of the special or confidential relationship  If disclosure of the  information is required by law or the information concerns illegal activities by the client  however the member or candidate may have an obligation to report the activities to the  appropriate authorities 
3,156,Status of Client
4,156,This standard protects the confidentiality of client information even if the person or entity is no  longer a client of the member or candidate  Therefore members and candidates must continue  to maintain the confidentiality of client records even after the client relationship has ended  If a  client or former client expressly authorizes the member or candidate to disclose information  however the member or candidate may follow the terms of the authorization and provide the  information 
5,156,Compliance with Laws
6,156,As a general matter members and candidates must comply with applicable law  If applicable  law requires disclosure of client information in certain circumstances members and candidates  must comply with the law  Similarly if applicable law requires members and candidates to  maintain confidentiality even if the information concerns illegal activities on the part of the  client members and candidates should not disclose such information  Additionally applicable  laws such as inter departmental communication restrictions within financial institutions can  impose limitations on information flow about a client within an entity that may lead to a  violation of confidentiality  When in doubt members and candidates should consult with their  employer s compliance personnel or legal counsel before disclosing confidential information  about clients 
7,156,Electronic Information and Security
8,156,Because of the ever increasing volume of electronically stored information members and  candidates need to be particularly aware of possible accidental disclosures  Many employers  have strict policies about how to electronically communicate sensitive client information and  store client information on personal laptops mobile devices or portable disk flash drives  In  recent years regulatory authorities have imposed stricter data security laws applying to the use  of mobile remote digital communication including the use of social media that must be  considered  Standard III E  does not require members or candidates to become experts in  information security technology but they should have a thorough understanding of the policies  of their employer  The size and operations of the firm will lead to differing policies for ensuring  the security of confidential information maintained within the firm  Members and candidates  should encourage their firm to conduct regular periodic training on confidentiality procedures  for all firm personnel including portfolio associates receptionists and other non investment  staff who have routine direct contact with clients and their records

2,157,Professional Conduct Investigations by CFA Institute
3,157,The requirements of Standard III E  are not intended to prevent members and candidates from  cooperating with an investigation by the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program  PCP    When permissible under applicable law members and candidates shall consider the PCP an  extension of themselves when requested to provide information about a client in support of a  PCP investigation into their own conduct  Members and candidates are encouraged to cooperate  with investigations into the conduct of others  Any information turned over to the PCP is kept in  the strictest confidence  Members and candidates will not be considered in violation of this  standard by forwarding confidential information to the PCP 
4,157,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
5,157,The simplest most conservative and most effective way to comply with Standard III E  is to  avoid disclosing any information received from a client except to authorized fellow employees  who are also working for the client  In some instances however a member or candidate may  want to disclose information received from clients that is outside the scope of the confidential  relationship and does not involve illegal activities  Before making such a disclosure a member  or candidate should ask the following 
6,157,  In what context was the information disclosed  If disclosed in a discussion of work being  performed for the client is the information relevant to the work 
7,157,  Is the information background material that if disclosed will enable the member or  candidate to improve service to the client 
8,157,Members and candidates need to understand and follow their firm s electronic information  communication and storage procedures  If the firm does not have procedures in place members  and candidates should encourage the development of procedures that appropriately reflect the  firm s size and business operations 
9,157,Communicating with Clients
10,157,Technological changes are constantly enhancing the methods that are used to communicate with  clients and prospective clients  Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to  ensure that firm supported communication methods and compliance procedures follow  practices designed for preventing accidental distribution of confidential information  Given the  rate at which technology changes a regular review of privacy protection measures is  encouraged 
11,157,Members and candidates should be diligent in discussing with clients the appropriate methods  for providing confidential information  It is important to convey to clients that not all firm  sponsored resources may be appropriate for such communications

4,158,Comment  The trustees gave Connor the internal reports so she could advise them  on how to manage their endowment funds  Because the information in the reports is  clearly both confidential and within the scope of the confidential relationship  Standard III E  requires that Connor refuse to divulge information to Kasey

10,158,Comment  Samuel should inform her supervisor of these activities and her  employer should take steps with Garcia to remedy the violations  If that approach  is not successful Samuel and her employer should seek advice of legal counsel to  determine the appropriate steps to be taken  Samuel may well have a duty to  disclose the evidence she has of the continuing legal violations and to resign as  asset manager for Garcia

7,159,Six months later in early January Moody posted LTC s year end  Market Outlook   The report  outlined a new asset allocation strategy that the firm is adding to its recommendations in the  new year  Moody introduced the publication with a note informing her clients that she would be  discussing the changes with them individually in their upcoming meetings 
8,159,One of Moody s clients responded directly on the group page that his family recently  experienced a major change in their financial profile  The client described highly personal and  confidential details of the event  Unfortunately all clients that were part of the group were also  able to read the detailed posting until Moody was able to have the comment removed 
9,159,Comment  Moody has taken reasonable steps for protecting the confidentiality of  client information while using the social media platform  She provided instructions  clarifying that all information posted to the site would be publically viewable to all  group members and warned against using this method for communicating  confidential information  The accidental disclosure of confidential information by a  client is not under Moody s control  Her actions to remove the information  promptly once she became aware further align with Standard III E  
10,159,In understanding the potential sensitivity clients express surrounding the  confidentiality of personal information this event highlights a need for further  training  Moody might advocate for additional warnings or controls for clients  when they consider using social media platforms for two way communications

12,160,  Nature of Employment
13,160,Standard IV A  requires members and candidates to protect the interests of their firm by  refraining from any conduct that would injure the firm deprive it of profit or deprive it of the  member s or candidate s skills and ability  Members and candidates must always place the  interests of clients above the interests of their employer but should also consider the effects of  their conduct on the sustainability and integrity of the employer firm  In matters related to their  employment members and candidates must not engage in conduct that harms the interests of  their employer  Implicit in this standard is the obligation of members and candidates to comply  with the policies and procedures established by their employers that govern the employer  employee relationship to the extent that such policies and procedures do not conflict with  applicable laws rules or regulations or the Code and Standards 
14,160,This standard is not meant to be a blanket requirement to place employer interests ahead of  personal interests in all matters  The standard does not require members and candidates to  subordinate important personal and family obligations to their work  Members and candidates  should enter into a dialogue with their employer about balancing personal and employment  obligations when personal matters may interfere with their work on a regular or significant  basis

2,161,Employer Responsibilities
3,161,The employer employee relationship imposes duties and responsibilities on both parties   Employers must recognize the duties and responsibilities that they owe to their employees if  they expect to have content and productive employees 
4,161,Members and candidates are encouraged to provide their employer with a copy of the Code and  Standards  These materials will inform the employer of the responsibilities of a CFA Institute  member or a candidate in the CFA Program  The Code and Standards also serve as a basis for  questioning employer policies and practices that conflict with these responsibilities 
5,161,Employers are not obligated to adhere to the Code and Standards  In expecting to retain  competent employees who are members and candidates however they should not develop  conflicting policies and procedures  The employer is responsible for a positive working  environment which includes an ethical workplace  Senior management has the additional  responsibility to devise compensation structures and incentive arrangements that do not  encourage unethical behavior 
6,161,Independent Practice
7,161,Included in Standard IV A  is the requirement that members and candidates abstain from  independent competitive activity that could conflict with the interests of their employer   Although Standard IV A  does not preclude members or candidates from entering into an  independent business while still employed members and candidates who plan to engage in  independent practice for compensation must notify their employer and describe the types of  services they will render to prospective independent clients the expected duration of the  services and the compensation for the services  Members and candidates should not render  services until they receive consent from their employer to all of the terms of the arrangement    Practice  means any service that the employer currently makes available for remuneration    Undertaking independent practice  means engaging in competitive business as opposed to  making preparations to begin such practice 
8,161,Leaving an Employer
9,161,When members and candidates are planning to leave their current employer they must continue  to act in the employer s best interest  They must not engage in any activities that would conflict  with this duty until their resignation becomes effective  It is difficult to define specific  guidelines for those members and candidates who are planning to compete with their employer  as part of a new venture  The circumstances of each situation must be reviewed to distinguish  permissible preparations from violations of duty  Activities that might constitute a violation  especially in combination include the following 
10,161,  misappropriation of trade secrets
11,161,  misuse of confidential information
12,161,  solicitation of the employer s clients prior to cessation of employment
13,161,  self dealing  appropriating for one s own property a business opportunity or information  belonging to one s employer  and

2,162,  misappropriation of clients or client lists 
3,162,A departing employee is generally free to make arrangements or preparations to go into a  competitive business before terminating the relationship with his or her employer as long as  such preparations do not breach the employee s duty of loyalty  A member or candidate who is  contemplating seeking other employment must not contact existing clients or potential clients  prior to leaving his or her employer for purposes of soliciting their business for the new  employer  Once notice is provided to the employer of the intent to resign the member or  candidate must follow the employer s policies and procedures related to notifying clients of his  or her planned departure  In addition the member or candidate must not take records or files to  a new employer without the written permission of the previous employer 
4,162,Once an employee has left the firm the skills and experience that an employee obtained while  employed are not  confidential  or  privileged  information  Similarly simple knowledge of  the names and existence of former clients is generally not confidential information unless  deemed such by an agreement or by law  Standard IV A  does not prohibit experience or  knowledge gained at one employer from being used at another employer  Firm records or work  performed on behalf of the firm that is stored in paper copy or electronically for the member s  or candidate s convenience while employed however should be erased or returned to the  employer unless the firm gives permission to keep those records after employment ends 
5,162,The standard does not prohibit former employees from contacting clients of their previous firm  as long as the contact information does not come from the records of the former employer or  violate an applicable  noncompete agreement   Members and candidates are free to use public  information after departing to contact former clients without violating Standard IV A  as long  as there is no specific agreement not to do so 
6,162,Employers often require employees to sign noncompete agreements that preclude a departing  employee from engaging in certain conduct  Members and candidates should take care to  review the terms of any such agreement when leaving their employer to determine what if any  conduct those agreements may prohibit 
7,162,In some markets there are agreements between employers within an industry that outline  information that departing employees are permitted to take upon resignation such as the   Protocol for Broker Recruiting  in the United States  These agreements ease individuals   transition between firms that have agreed to follow the outlined procedures  Members and  candidates who move between firms that sign such agreements may rely on the protections  provided as long as they faithfully adhere to all the procedures outlined 
8,162,For example under the agreement between many US brokers individuals are allowed to take  some general client contact information when departing  To be protected a copy of the  information the individual is taking must be provided to the local management team for review   Additionally the specific client information may only be used by the departing employee and  not others employed by the new firm

2,163,Use of Social Media
3,163,The growth in various online networking platforms such as LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook   commonly referred to as social media platforms  is providing new opportunities and  challenges for businesses  Members and candidates should understand and abide by all  applicable firm policies and regulations as to the acceptable use of social media platforms to  interact with clients and prospective clients  This is especially important when a member or  candidate is planning to leave an employer 
4,163,Social media use makes determining how and when departure notification is delivered to clients  more complex  Members and candidates may have developed profiles on these platforms that  include connections with individuals who are clients of the firm as well as individuals  unrelated to their employer  Communications through social media platforms that potentially  reach current clients should adhere to the employer s policies and procedures regarding  notification of departing employees 
5,163,Social media connections with clients are also raising questions concerning the differences  between public information and firm property  Specific accounts and user profiles of members  and candidates may be created for solely professional reasons including firm approved  accounts for client engagements  Such firm approved business related accounts would be  considered part of the firm s assets thus requiring members and candidates to transfer or delete  the accounts as directed by their firm s policies and procedures  Best practice for members and  candidates is to maintain separate accounts for their personal and professional social media  activities  Members and candidates should discuss with their employers how profiles should be  treated when a single account includes personal connections and also is used to conduct aspects  of their professional activities 
6,163,Whistleblowing
7,163,A member s or candidate s personal interests as well as the interests of his or her employer are  secondary to protecting the integrity of capital markets and the interests of clients  Therefore  circumstances may arise  e g  when an employer is engaged in illegal or unethical activity  in  which members and candidates must act contrary to their employer s interests in order to  comply with their duties to the market and clients  In such instances activities that would  normally violate a member s or candidate s duty to his or her employer  such as contradicting  employer instructions violating certain policies and procedures or preserving a record by  copying employer records  may be justified  Such action would be permitted only if the intent is  clearly aimed at protecting clients or the integrity of the market not for personal gain 
8,163,Nature of Employment
9,163,A wide variety of business relationships exists within the investment industry  For instance a  member or candidate may be an employee or an independent contractor  Members and  candidates must determine whether they are employees or independent contractors in order to  determine the applicability of Standard IV A   This issue will be decided largely by the degree  of control exercised by the employing entity over the member or candidate  Factors determining  control include whether the member s or candidate s hours work location and other parameters  of the job are set  whether facilities are provided to the member or candidate  whether the  member s or candidate s expenses are reimbursed  whether the member or candidate seeks  work from other employers  and the number of clients or employers the member or candidate  works for

2,164,A member s or candidate s duties within an independent contractor relationship are governed  by the oral or written agreement between the member and the client  Members and candidates  should take care to define clearly the scope of their responsibilities and the expectations of each  client within the context of each relationship  Once a member or candidate establishes a  relationship with a client the member or candidate has a duty to abide by the terms of the  agreement 
3,164,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
4,164,Employers may establish codes of conduct and operating procedures for their employees to  follow  Members and candidates should fully understand the policies to ensure that they are not  in conflict with the Code and Standards  The following topics identify policies that members  and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt if the policies are not currently in place 
5,164,Competition Policy
6,164,A member or candidate must understand any restrictions placed by the employer on offering  similar services outside the firm while employed by the firm  The policy may outline the  procedures for requesting approval to undertake the outside service or may be a strict  prohibition of such service  If a member s or candidate s employer elects to have its employees  sign a noncompete agreement as part of the employment agreement the member or candidate  should ensure that the details are clear and fully explained prior to signing the agreement 
7,164,Termination Policy
8,164,Members and candidates should clearly understand the termination policies of their employer   Termination policies should establish clear procedures regarding the resignation process  including addressing how the termination will be disclosed to clients and staff and whether  updates posted through social media platforms will be allowed  The firm s policy may also  outline the procedures for transferring ongoing research and account management  responsibilities  Finally the procedures should address agreements that allow departing  employees to remove specific client related information upon resignation 
9,164,Incident Reporting Procedures
10,164,Members and candidates should be aware of their firm s policies related to whistleblowing and  encourage their firm to adopt industry best practices in this area  Many firms are required by  regulatory mandates to establish confidential and anonymous reporting procedures that allow  employees to report potentially unethical and illegal activities in the firm 
11,164,Employee Classification
12,164,Members and candidates should understand their status within their employer firm  Firms are  encouraged to adopt a standardized classification structure  e g  part time full time outside  contractor  for their employees and indicate how each of the firm s policies applies to each  employee class

3,165,Example    Soliciting Former Clients  
4,165,Samuel Magee manages pension accounts for Trust Assets Inc  but has become frustrated with  the working environment and has been offered a position with Fiduciary Management  Before  resigning from Trust Assets Magee asks four big accounts to leave that firm and open accounts  with Fiduciary  Magee also persuades several prospective clients to sign agreements with  Fiduciary Management  Magee had previously made presentations to these prospects on behalf  of Trust Assets 
5,165,Comment  Magee violated the employee employer principle requiring him to act  solely for his employer s benefit  Magee s duty is to Trust Assets as long as he is  employed there  The solicitation of Trust Assets  current clients and prospective  clients is unethical and violates Standard IV A  
6,165,Example    Former Employer s Documents and Files  
7,165,James Hightower has been employed by Jason Investment Management Corporation for     years  He began as an analyst but assumed increasing responsibilities and is now a senior  portfolio manager and a member of the firm s investment policy committee  Hightower has  decided to leave Jason Investment and start his own investment management business  He has  been careful not to tell any of Jason s clients that he is leaving  he does not want to be accused  of breaching his duty to Jason by soliciting Jason s clients before his departure  Hightower is  planning to copy and take with him the following documents and information he developed or  worked on while at Jason      the client list with addresses telephone numbers and other  pertinent client information      client account statements      sample marketing presentations  to prospective clients containing Jason s performance record      Jason s recommended list of  securities      computer models to determine asset allocations for accounts with various  objectives      computer models for stock selection  and     personal computer spreadsheets for  Hightower s major corporate recommendations which he developed when he was an analyst 
8,165,Comment  Except with the consent of their employer departing members and  candidates may not take employer property which includes books records reports  and other materials because taking such materials may interfere with their  employer s business opportunities  Taking any employer records even those the  member or candidate prepared violates Standard IV A   Employer records include  items stored in hard copy or any other medium  e g  home computers portable  storage devices cell phones

2,166,Example    Addressing Rumors  
3,166,Reuben Winston manages all equity portfolios at Target Asset Management  TAM  a large  established investment counselor  Ten years previously Philpott   Company which manages a  family of global bond mutual funds acquired TAM in a diversification move  After the merger  the combined operations prospered in the fixed income business but the equity management  business at TAM languished  Lately a few of the equity pension accounts that had been with  TAM before the merger have terminated their relationships with TAM  One day Winston finds  on his voice mail the following message from a concerned client   Hey  I just heard that  Philpott is close to announcing the sale of your firm s equity management business to Rugged  Life  What is going on   Not being aware of any such deal Winston and his associates are  stunned  Their internal inquiries are met with denials from Philpott management but the rumors  persist  Feeling left in the dark Winston contemplates leading an employee buyout of TAM s  equity management business 
4,166,Comment  An employee led buyout of TAM s equity asset management business  would be consistent with Standard IV A  because it would rest on the permission  of the employer and ultimately the clients  In this case however in which  employees suspect the senior managers or principals are not truthful or  forthcoming Winston should consult legal counsel to determine appropriate action 
5,166,Example    Ownership of Completed Prior Work  
6,166,Laura Clay who is unemployed wants part time consulting work while seeking a full time  analyst position  During an interview at Bradley Associates a large institutional asset manager  Clay is told that the firm has no immediate research openings but would be willing to pay her a  flat fee to complete a study of the wireless communications industry within a given period of  time  Clay would be allowed unlimited access to Bradley s research files and would be  welcome to come to the offices and use whatever support facilities are available during normal  working hours  Bradley s research director does not seek any exclusivity for Clay s output and  the two agree to the arrangement on a handshake  As Clay nears completion of the study she is  offered an analyst job in the research department of Winston   Company a brokerage firm and  she is pondering submitting the draft of her wireless study for publication by Winston 
7,166,Comment  Although she is under no written contractual obligation to Bradley Clay  has an obligation to let Bradley act on the output of her study before Winston    Company or Clay uses the information to their advantage  That is unless Bradley  gives permission to Clay and waives its rights to her wireless report Clay would be  in violation of Standard IV A  if she were to immediately recommend to Winston  the same transactions recommended in the report to Bradley  Furthermore Clay  must not take from Bradley any research file material or other property that she  may have used

3,167,Emma Madeline a recent college graduate and a candidate in the CFA Program spends her  summer as an unpaid intern at Murdoch and Lowell  The senior managers at Murdoch are  attempting to bring the firm into compliance with the GIPS standards and Madeline is assigned  to assist in its efforts  Two months into her internship Madeline applies for a job at McMillan    Company which has plans to become GIPS compliant  Madeline accepts the job with  McMillan  Before leaving Murdoch she copies the firm s software that she helped develop  because she believes this software will assist her in her new position 
4,167,Comment  Even though Madeline does not receive monetary compensation for her  services at Murdoch she has used firm resources in creating the software and is  considered an employee because she receives compensation and benefits in the  form of work experience and knowledge  By copying the software Madeline  violated Standard IV A  because she misappropriated Murdoch s property without  permission 
5,167,Example    Soliciting Former Clients  
6,167,Dennis Elliot has hired Sam Chisolm who previously worked for a competing firm  Chisolm  left his former firm after    years of employment  When Chisolm begins working for Elliot he  wants to contact his former clients because he knows them well and is certain that many will  follow him to his new employer  Is Chisolm in violation of Standard IV A  if he contacts his  former clients 
7,167,Comment  Because client records are the property of the firm contacting former  clients for any reason through the use of client lists or other information taken from  a former employer without permission would be a violation of Standard IV A   In  addition the nature and extent of the contact with former clients may be governed  by the terms of any noncompete agreement signed by the employee and the former  employer that covers contact with former clients after employment 
8,167,Simple knowledge of the names and existence of former clients is not confidential  information just as skills or experience that an employee obtains while employed  are not  confidential  or  privileged  information  The Code and Standards do not  impose a prohibition on the use of experience or knowledge gained at one  employer from being used at another employer  The Code and Standards also do  not prohibit former employees from contacting clients of their previous firm in the  absence of a noncompete agreement  Members and candidates are free to use  public information about their former firm after departing to contact former clients  without violating Standard IV A  
9,167,In the absence of a noncompete agreement as long as Chisolm maintains his duty  of loyalty to his employer before joining Elliot s firm does not take steps to solicit  clients until he has left his former firm and does not use material from his former  employer without its permission after he has left he is not in violation of the Code  and Standards

3,168,Geraldine Allen currently works at a registered investment company as an equity analyst   Without notice to her employer she registers with government authorities to start an investment  company that will compete with her employer but she does not actively seek clients  Does  registration of this competing company with the appropriate regulatory authorities constitute a  violation of Standard IV A  
4,168,Comment  Allen s preparation for the new business by registering with the  regulatory authorities does not conflict with the work for her employer if the  preparations have been done on Allen s own time outside the office and if Allen  will not be soliciting clients for the business or otherwise operating the new  company until she has left her current employer 
5,168,Example    Competing with Current Employer  
6,168,Several employees are planning to depart their current employer within a few weeks and have  been careful to not engage in any activities that would conflict with their duty to their current  employer  They have just learned that one of their employer s clients has undertaken a request  for proposal  RFP  to review and possibly hire a new investment consultant  The RFP has been  sent to the employer and all of its competitors  The group believes that the new entity to be  formed would be qualified to respond to the RFP and be eligible for the business  The RFP  submission period is likely to conclude before the employees  resignations are effective  Is it  permissible for the group of departing employees to respond to the RFP for their anticipated  new firm 
7,168,Comment  A group of employees responding to an RFP that their employer is also  responding to would lead to direct competition between the employees and the  employer  Such conduct violates Standard IV A  unless the group of employees  receives permission from their employer as well as the entity sending out the RFP

3,169,After leaving her employer Shawna McQuillen establishes her own money management  business  While with her former employer she did not sign a noncompete agreement that would  have prevented her from soliciting former clients  Upon her departure she does not take any of  her client lists or contact information and she clears her personal computer of any employer  records including client contact information  She obtains the phone numbers of her former  clients through public records and contacts them to solicit their business 
4,169,Comment  McQuillen is not in violation of Standard IV A  because she has not  used information or records from her former employer and is not prevented by an  agreement with her former employer from soliciting her former clients 
5,169,Example     Whistleblowing Actions  
6,169,Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy side trading desk and concentrates on in house trades for a  hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the investment management firm  The hedge fund  has been very successful and is marketed globally by the firm  From her experience as the  trader for much of the activity of the fund Rasmussen has become quite knowledgeable about  the hedge fund s strategy tactics and performance  When a distinct break in the market occurs  however and many of the securities involved in the hedge fund s strategy decline markedly in  value Rasmussen observes that the reported performance of the hedge fund does not reflect this  decline  In her experience the lack of any effect is a very unlikely occurrence  She approaches  the head of trading about her concern and is told that she should not ask any questions and that  the fund is big and successful and is not her concern  She is fairly sure something is not right so  she contacts the compliance officer who also tells her to stay away from the issue of this hedge  fund s reporting 
7,169,Comment  Rasmussen has clearly come upon an error in policies procedures and  compliance practices in the firm s operations  Having been unsuccessful in finding  a resolution with her supervisor and the compliance officer Rasmussen should  consult the firm s whistleblowing policy to determine the appropriate next step  toward informing management of her concerns  The potentially unethical actions of  the investment management division are appropriate grounds for further disclosure  so Rasmussen s whistleblowing would not represent a violation of Standard IV A

4,170,Krista Smith is a relatively new assistant trader for the fixed income desk of a major investment  bank  She is on a team responsible for structuring collateralized debt obligations  CDOs  made  up of securities in the inventory of the trading desk  At a meeting of the team senior executives  explain the opportunity to eventually separate the CDO into various risk rated tranches to be  sold to the clients of the firm  After the senior executives leave the meeting the head trader  announces various responsibilities of each member of the team and then says  This is a good  time to unload some of the junk we have been stuck with for a while and disguise it with ratings  and a thick unreadable prospectus so don t be shy in putting this CDO together  Just kidding    Smith is worried by this remark and asks some of her colleagues what the head trader meant   They all respond that he was just kidding but that there is some truth in the remark because the  CDO is seen by management as an opportunity to improve the quality of the securities in the  firm s inventory 
5,170,Concerned about the ethical environment of the workplace Smith decides to talk to her  supervisor about her concerns and provides the head trader with a copy of the Code and  Standards  Smith discusses the principle of placing the client above the interest of the firm and  the possibility that the development of the new CDO will not adhere to this responsibility  The  head trader assures Smith that the appropriate analysis will be conducted when determining the  appropriate securities for collateral  Furthermore the ratings are assigned by an independent  firm and the prospectus will include full and factual disclosures  Smith is reassured by the  meeting but she also reviews the company s procedures and requirements for reporting  potential violations of company policy and securities laws 
6,170,Comment  Smith s review of the company policies and procedures for reporting  violations allows her to be prepared to report through the appropriate whistleblower  process if she decides that the CDO development process involves unethical  actions by others  Smith s actions comply with the Code and Standards principles  of placing the client s interests first and being loyal to her employer  In providing  her supervisor with a copy of the Code and Standards Smith is highlighting the  high level of ethical conduct she is required to adhere to in her professional  activities

2,172,Guidance
3,172,Standard IV B  requires members and candidates to obtain permission from their employer  before accepting compensation or other benefits from third parties for the services rendered to  the employer or for any services that might create a conflict with their employer s interest   Compensation and benefits include direct compensation by the client and any indirect  compensation or other benefits received from third parties   Written consent  includes any form  of communication that can be documented  for example communication via e mail that can be  retrieved and documented  
4,172,Members and candidates must obtain permission for additional compensation benefits because  such arrangements may affect loyalties and objectivity and create potential conflicts of interest   Disclosure allows an employer to consider the outside arrangements when evaluating the  actions and motivations of members and candidates  Moreover the employer is entitled to have  full knowledge of all compensation benefit arrangements so as to be able to assess the true cost  of the services members or candidates are providing 
5,172,There may be instances in which a member or candidate is hired by an employer on a  part  time  basis   Part time  status applies to employees who do not commit the full number of  hours required for a normal work week  Members and candidates should discuss possible  limitations to their abilities to provide services that may be competitive with their employer  during the negotiation and hiring process  The requirements of Standard IV B  would be  applicable to limitations identified at that time 
6,172,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
7,172,Members and candidates should make an immediate written report to their supervisor and  compliance officer specifying any compensation they propose to receive for services in addition  to the compensation or benefits received from their employer  The details of the report should  be confirmed by the party offering the additional compensation including performance  incentives offered by clients  This written report should state the terms of any agreement under  which a member or candidate will receive additional compensation   terms  include the nature  of the compensation the approximate amount of compensation and the duration of the  agreement

4,174,Guidance
5,174,Highlights 
6,174,  System for Supervision
7,174,  Supervision Includes Detection
8,174,Standard IV C  states that members and candidates must promote actions by all employees  under their supervision and authority to comply with applicable laws rules regulations and  firm policies and the Code and Standards 
9,174,Any investment professional who has employees subject to her or his control or  influence whether or not the employees are CFA Institute members CFA charterholders or  candidates in the CFA Program exercises supervisory responsibility  Members and candidates  acting as supervisors must also have in depth knowledge of the Code and Standards so that they  can apply this knowledge in discharging their supervisory responsibilities 
10,174,The conduct that constitutes reasonable supervision in a particular case depends on the number  of employees supervised and the work performed by those employees  Members and candidates  with oversight responsibilities for large numbers of employees may not be able to personally  evaluate the conduct of these employees on a continuing basis  These members and candidates  may delegate supervisory duties to subordinates who directly oversee the other employees  A  member s or candidate s responsibilities under Standard IV C  include instructing those  subordinates to whom supervision is delegated about methods to promote compliance including  preventing and detecting violations of laws rules regulations firm policies and the Code and  Standards 
11,174,At a minimum Standard IV C  requires that members and candidates with supervisory  responsibility make reasonable efforts to prevent and detect violations by ensuring the  establishment of effective compliance systems  However an effective compliance system goes  beyond enacting a code of ethics establishing policies and procedures to achieve compliance  with the code and applicable law and reviewing employee actions to determine whether they  are following the rules 
12,174,http   e pub dd v     cwhh    z b vbk OEBPS CFA     R     print

2,175,To be effective supervisors members and candidates should implement education and training  programs on a recurring or regular basis for employees under their supervision  Such programs  will assist the employees with meeting their professional obligations to practice in an ethical  manner within the applicable legal system  Further establishing incentives monetary or  otherwise for employees not only to meet business goals but also to reward ethical behavior  offers supervisors another way to assist employees in complying with their legal and ethical  obligations 
3,175,Often especially in large organizations members and candidates may have supervisory  responsibility but not the authority to establish or modify firm wide compliance policies and  procedures or incentive structures  Such limitations should not prevent a member or candidate  from working with his or her own superiors and within the firm structure to develop and  implement effective compliance tools including but not limited to 
4,175,  a code of ethics
5,175,  compliance policies and procedures
6,175,  education and training programs
7,175,  an incentive structure that rewards ethical conduct and
8,175,  adoption of firm wide best practice standards  e g  the GIPS standards the CFA Institute  Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct  
9,175,A member or candidate with supervisory responsibility should bring an inadequate compliance  system to the attention of the firm s senior managers and recommend corrective action  If the  member or candidate clearly cannot discharge supervisory responsibilities because of the  absence of a compliance system or because of an inadequate compliance system the member or  candidate should decline in writing to accept supervisory responsibility until the firm adopts  reasonable procedures to allow adequate exercise of supervisory responsibility 
10,175,System for Supervision
11,175,Members and candidates with supervisory responsibility must understand what constitutes an  adequate compliance system for their firms and make reasonable efforts to see that appropriate  compliance procedures are established documented communicated to covered personnel and  followed   Adequate  procedures are those designed to meet industry standards regulatory  requirements the requirements of the Code and Standards and the circumstances of the firm   Once compliance procedures are established the supervisor must also make reasonable efforts  to ensure that the procedures are monitored and enforced 
12,175,To be effective compliance procedures must be in place prior to the occurrence of a violation of  the law or the Code and Standards  Although compliance procedures cannot be designed to  anticipate every potential violation they should be designed to anticipate the activities most  likely to result in misconduct  Compliance programs must be appropriate for the size and nature  of the organization  The member or candidate should review model compliance procedures or  other industry programs to ensure that the firm s procedures meet the minimum industry  standards

2,176,Once a supervisor learns that an employee has violated or may have violated the law or the  Code and Standards the supervisor must promptly initiate an assessment to determine the  extent of the wrongdoing  Relying on an employee s statements about the extent of the violation  or assurances that the wrongdoing will not reoccur is not enough  Reporting the misconduct up  the chain of command and warning the employee to cease the activity are also not enough   Pending the outcome of the investigation a supervisor should take steps to ensure that the  violation will not be repeated such as placing limits on the employee s activities or increasing  the monitoring of the employee s activities 
3,176,Supervision Includes Detection
4,176,Members and candidates with supervisory responsibility must also make reasonable efforts to  detect violations of laws rules regulations firm policies and the Code and Standards  The  supervisors exercise reasonable supervision by establishing and implementing written  compliance procedures and ensuring that those procedures are followed through periodic  review  If a member or candidate has adopted reasonable procedures and taken steps to institute  an effective compliance program then the member or candidate may not be in violation of  Standard IV C  if he or she does not detect violations that occur despite these efforts  The fact  that violations do occur may indicate however that the compliance procedures are inadequate   In addition in some cases merely enacting such procedures may not be sufficient to fulfill the  duty required by Standard IV C   A member or candidate may be in violation of Standard IV C   if he or she knows or should know that the procedures designed to promote compliance  including detecting and preventing violations are not being followed 
5,176,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
6,176,Codes of Ethics or Compliance Procedures
7,176,Members and candidates are encouraged to recommend that their employers adopt a code of  ethics  Adoption of a code of ethics is critical to establishing a strong ethical foundation for  investment advisory firms and their employees  Codes of ethics formally emphasize and  reinforce the client loyalty responsibilities of investment firm personnel protect investing  clients by deterring misconduct and protect the firm s reputation for integrity 
8,176,There is a distinction however between codes of ethics and the specific policies and  procedures needed to ensure compliance with the codes and with securities laws and  regulations  Although both are important codes of ethics should consist of fundamental  principle based ethical and fiduciary concepts that are applicable to all of the firm s employees   In this way firms can best convey to employees and clients the ethical ideals that investment  advisers strive to achieve  These concepts need to be implemented however by detailed firm  wide compliance policies and procedures  Compliance procedures assist the firm s personnel in  fulfilling the responsibilities enumerated in the code of ethics and make probable that the ideals  expressed in the code of ethics will be adhered to in the day to day operation of the firm 
9,176,Stand alone codes of ethics should be written in plain language and should address general  fiduciary concepts  They should be unencumbered by numerous detailed procedures  Codes  presented in this way are the most effective in stressing to employees that they are in positions  of trust and must act with integrity at all times  Mingling compliance procedures in the firm s  code of ethics goes against the goal of reinforcing the ethical obligations of employees

2,177,Separating the code of ethics from compliance procedures will also reduce if not eliminate the  legal terminology and  boilerplate  language that can make the underlying ethical principles  incomprehensible to the average person  Above all to ensure the creation of a culture of ethics  and integrity rather than one that merely focuses on following the rules the principles in the  code of ethics must be stated in a way that is accessible and understandable to everyone in the  firm 
3,177,Members and candidates should encourage their employers to provide their codes of ethics to  clients  In this case also a simple straightforward code of ethics will be best understood by  clients  Unencumbered by the compliance procedures the code of ethics will be effective in  conveying that the firm is committed to conducting business in an ethical manner and in the  best interests of the clients 
4,177,Adequate Compliance Procedures
5,177,A supervisor complies with Standard IV C  by identifying situations in which legal violations  or violations of the Code and Standards are likely to occur and by establishing and enforcing  compliance procedures to prevent such violations  Adequate compliance procedures should
6,177,  be contained in a clearly written and accessible manual that is tailored to the firm s  operations
7,177,  be drafted so that the procedures are easy to understand
8,177,  designate a compliance officer whose authority and responsibility are clearly defined and  who has the necessary resources and authority to implement the firm s compliance  procedures
9,177,  describe the hierarchy of supervision and assign duties among supervisors
10,177,  implement a system of checks and balances
11,177,  outline the scope of the procedures
12,177,  outline procedures to document the monitoring and testing of compliance procedures
13,177,  outline permissible conduct and
14,177,  delineate procedures for reporting violations and sanctions 
15,177,Once a compliance program is in place a supervisor should
16,177,  disseminate the contents of the program to appropriate personnel
17,177,  periodically update procedures to ensure that the measures are adequate under the law
18,177,  continually educate personnel regarding the compliance procedures
19,177,  issue periodic reminders of the procedures to appropriate personnel
20,177,  incorporate a professional conduct evaluation as part of an employee s performance  review

2,178,  review the actions of employees to ensure compliance and identify violators and
3,178,  take the necessary steps to enforce the procedures once a violation has occurred 
4,178,Once a violation is discovered a supervisor should
5,178,  respond promptly
6,178,  conduct a thorough investigation of the activities to determine the scope of the  wrongdoing
7,178,  increase supervision or place appropriate limitations on the wrongdoer pending the  outcome of the investigation and
8,178,  review procedures for potential changes necessary to prevent future violations from  occurring 
9,178,Implementation of Compliance Education and Training
10,178,No amount of ethics education and awareness will deter someone determined to commit fraud  for personal enrichment  But the vast majority of investment professionals strive to achieve  personal success with dedicated service to their clients and employers 
11,178,Regular ethics and compliance training in conjunction with adoption of a code of ethics is  critical to investment firms seeking to establish a strong culture of integrity and to provide an  environment in which employees routinely engage in ethical conduct in compliance with the  law  Training and education assist individuals in both recognizing areas that are prone to ethical  and legal pitfalls and identifying those circumstances and influences that can impair ethical  judgment 
12,178,By implementing educational programs supervisors can train their subordinates to put into  practice what the firm s code of ethics requires  Education helps employees make the link  between legal and ethical conduct and the long term success of the business  a strong culture of  compliance signals to clients and potential clients that the firm has truly embraced ethical  conduct as fundamental to the firm s mission to serve its clients 
13,178,Establish an Appropriate Incentive Structure
14,178,Even if individuals want to make the right choices and follow an ethical course of conduct and  are aware of the obstacles that may trip them up they can still be influenced to act improperly  by a corporate culture that embraces a  succeed at all costs  mentality stresses results  regardless of the methods used to achieve those results and does not reward ethical behavior   Supervisors can reinforce an individual s natural desire to  do the right thing  by building a  culture of integrity in the workplace 
15,178,Supervisors and firms must look closely at their incentive structure to determine whether the  structure encourages profits and returns at the expense of ethically appropriate conduct  Reward  structures may turn a blind eye to how desired outcomes are achieved and encourage  dysfunctional or counterproductive behavior  Only when compensation and incentives are  firmly tied to client interests and how outcomes are achieved rather than how much is generated  for the firm will employees work to achieve a culture of integrity

5,179,Comment  Mattock has violated Standard IV C  by failing to reasonably and  adequately supervise the actions of those accountable to her  She did not prevent or  establish reasonable procedures designed to prevent dissemination of or trading on  the information by those who knew of her changed recommendation  She must  ensure that her firm has procedures for reviewing or recording any trading in the  stock of a corporation that has been the subject of an unpublished change in  recommendation  Adequate procedures would have informed the subordinates of  their duties and detected sales by Frampton and selected customers

7,180,Comment  Henry violated Standard IV C  by failing to adequately supervise  Tabbing with respect to her S P     trading  Henry further violated Standard IV  C  by failing to establish record keeping and reporting procedures to prevent or  detect Tabbing s violations  Henry must make a reasonable effort to determine that  adequate compliance procedures covering all employee trading activity are  established documented communicated and followed

2,181,Example    Accepting Responsibility  
3,181,Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy side trading desk and concentrates on in house trades for a  hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the investment management firm  The hedge fund  has been very successful and is marketed globally by the firm  From her experience as the  trader for much of the activity of the fund Rasmussen has become quite knowledgeable about  the hedge fund s strategy tactics and performance  When a distinct break in the market occurs  and many of the securities involved in the hedge fund s strategy decline markedly in value  however Rasmussen observes that the reported performance of the hedge fund does not at all  reflect this decline  From her experience this lack of an effect is a very unlikely occurrence   She approaches the head of trading about her concern and is told that she should not ask any  questions and that the fund is too big and successful and is not her concern  She is fairly sure  something is not right so she contacts the compliance officer and is again told to stay away  from the hedge fund reporting issue 
4,181,Comment  Rasmussen has clearly come upon an error in policies procedures and  compliance practices within the firm s operations  According to Standard IV C   the supervisor and the compliance officer have the responsibility to review the  concerns brought forth by Rasmussen  Supervisors have the responsibility of  establishing and encouraging an ethical culture in the firm  The dismissal of  Rasmussen s question violates Standard IV C  and undermines the firm s ethical  operations

4,182,Comment  Papis s actions highlight the need for supervision and review at all levels  in an organization  His responsibilities may include the selection of external  advisers but the decision to change advisers appears arbitrary  Members and  candidates should ensure that their firm has appropriate policies and procedures in  place to detect inappropriate actions such as the action taken by Papis

4,183,One of Chen s direct reports Huang Mei covers the banking industry  Chen must submit the  latest updates to the portfolio management team tomorrow morning  Huang has yet to submit  her research report on ZYX Bank because she is uncomfortable providing a  buy  or  sell   opinion of ZYX on the basis of the completed analysis  Pressed for time and concerned that  Chen will reject a  hold  recommendation she researches various websites and blogs on the  banking sector for whatever she can find on ZYX  One independent blogger provides a new  interpretation of the recently reported data Huang has analyzed and concludes with a strong   sell  recommendation for ZYX  She is impressed by the originality and resourcefulness of this  blogger s report 
5,183,Very late in the evening Huang submits her report and  sell  recommendation to Chen without  any reference to the independent blogger s report  Given the late time of the submission and the  competence of Huang s prior work Chen compiles this report with the recommendations from  each of the other analysts and meets with the portfolio managers to discuss implementation

9,184,  Group Research and Decision Making
10,184,The application of Standard V A  depends on the investment philosophy the member  candidate or firm is following the role of the member or candidate in the investment decision  making process and the support and resources provided by the member s or candidate s  employer  These factors will dictate the nature of the diligence and thoroughness of the research  and the level of investigation required by Standard V A  
11,184,The requirements for issuing conclusions based on research will vary in relation to the  member s or candidate s role in the investment decision making process but the member or  candidate must make reasonable efforts to cover all pertinent issues when arriving at a  recommendation  Members and candidates enhance transparency by providing or offering to  provide supporting information to clients when recommending a purchase or sale or when  changing a recommendation 
12,184,Defining Diligence and Reasonable Basis
13,184,Every investment decision is based on a set of facts known and understood at the time  Clients  turn to members and candidates for advice and expect these advisers to have more information  and knowledge than they do  This information and knowledge is the basis from which members  and candidates apply their professional judgment in taking investment actions and making  recommendations 
14,184,At a basic level clients want assurance that members and candidates are putting forth the  necessary effort to support the recommendations they are making  Communicating the level and  thoroughness of the information reviewed before the member or candidate makes a judgment  allows clients to understand the reasonableness of the recommended investment actions 
15,184,As with determining the suitability of an investment for the client the necessary level of  research and analysis will differ with the product security or service being offered  In  providing an investment service members and candidates typically use a variety of resources  including company reports third party research and results from quantitative models  A  reasonable basis is formed through a balance of these resources appropriate for the security or  decision being analyzed 
16,184,The following list provides some but definitely not all examples of attributes to consider while  forming the basis for a recommendation

2,185,  global regional and country macroeconomic conditions
3,185,  a company s operating and financial history
4,185,  the industry s and sector s current conditions and the stage of the business cycle
5,185,  a mutual fund s fee structure and management history
6,185,  the output and potential limitations of quantitative models
7,185,  the quality of the assets included in a securitization and
8,185,  the appropriateness of selected peer group comparisons 
9,185,Even though an investment recommendation may be well informed downside risk remains for  any investment  Members and candidates can base their decisions only on the information  available at the time decisions are made  The steps taken in developing a diligent and  reasonable recommendation should minimize unexpected downside events 
10,185,Using Secondary or Third Party Research
11,185,If members and candidates rely on secondary or third party research they must make  reasonable and diligent efforts to determine whether such research is sound  Secondary research  is defined as research conducted by someone else in the member s or candidate s firm  Third  party research is research conducted by entities outside the member s or candidate s firm such  as a brokerage firm bank or research firm  If a member or candidate has reason to suspect that  either secondary or third party research or information comes from a source that lacks a sound  basis the member or candidate must not rely on that information 
12,185,Members and candidates should make reasonable enquiries into the source and accuracy of all  data used in completing their investment analysis and recommendations  The sources of the  information and data will influence the level of the review a member or candidate must  undertake  Information and data taken from internet sources such as personal blogs  independent research aggregation websites or social media websites likely require a greater  level of review than information from more established research organizations 
13,185,Criteria that a member or candidate can use in forming an opinion on whether research is sound  include the following 
14,185,  assumptions used
15,185,  rigor of the analysis performed
16,185,  date timeliness of the research and
17,185,  evaluation of the objectivity and independence of the recommendations

2,186,A member or candidate may rely on others in his or her firm to determine whether secondary or  third party research is sound and use the information in good faith unless the member or  candidate has reason to question its validity or the processes and procedures used by those  responsible for the research  For example a portfolio manager may not have a choice of a data  source because the firm s senior managers conducted due diligence to determine which vendor  would provide services  the member or candidate can use the information in good faith  assuming the due diligence process was deemed adequate 
3,186,A member or candidate should verify that the firm has a policy about the timely and consistent  review of approved research providers to ensure that the quality of the research continues to  meet the necessary standards  If such a policy is not in place at the firm the member or  candidate should encourage the development and adoption of a formal review practice 
4,186,Using Quantitatively Oriented Research
5,186,Standard V A  applies to the rapidly expanding use of quantitatively oriented research models  and processes such as computer generated modeling screening and ranking of investment  securities  the creation or valuation of derivative instruments  and quantitative portfolio  construction techniques  These models and processes are being used for much more than the  back testing of investment strategies especially with continually advancing technology and  techniques  The continued broad development of quantitative methods and models is an  important part of capital market developments 
6,186,Members and candidates need to have an understanding of the parameters used in models and  quantitative research that are incorporated into their investment recommendations  Although  they are not required to become experts in every technical aspect of the models they must  understand the assumptions and limitations inherent in any model and how the results were used  in the decision making process 
7,186,The reliance on and potential limitations of financial models became clear through the  investment crisis that unfolded in      and       In some cases the financial models used to  value specific securities and related derivative products did not adequately demonstrate the  level of associated risks  Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to test the  output of investment models and other pre programed analytical tools they use  Such validation  should occur before incorporating the process into their methods models or analyses 
8,186,Although not every model can test for every factor or outcome members and candidates should  ensure that their analyses incorporate a broad range of assumptions sufficient to capture the  underlying characteristics of investments  The omission from the analysis of potentially  negative outcomes or of levels of risk outside the norm may misrepresent the true economic  value of an investment  The possible scenarios for analysis should include factors that are likely  to have a substantial influence on the investment value and may include extremely positive and  negative scenarios

2,187,Developing Quantitatively Oriented Techniques
3,187,Individuals who create new quantitative models and services must exhibit a higher level of  diligence in reviewing new products than the individuals who ultimately use the analytical  output  Members and candidates involved in the development and oversight of quantitatively  oriented models methods and algorithms must understand the technical aspects of the products  they provide to clients  A thorough testing of the model and resulting analysis should be  completed prior to product distribution 
4,187,Members and candidates need to consider the source and time horizon of the data used as inputs  in financial models  The information from many commercially available databases may not  effectively incorporate both positive and negative market cycles  In the development of a  recommendation the member or candidate may need to test the models by using volatility and  performance expectations that represent scenarios outside the observable databases  In  reviewing the computer models or the resulting output members and candidates need to pay  particular attention to the assumptions used in the analysis and the rigor of the analysis to  ensure that the model incorporates a wide range of possible input expectations including  negative market events 
5,187,Selecting External Advisers and Subadvisers
6,187,Financial instruments and asset allocation techniques continue to develop and evolve  This  progression has led to the use of specialized managers to invest in specific asset classes or  diversification strategies that complement a firm s in house expertise  Standard V A  applies to  the level of review necessary in selecting an external adviser or subadviser to manage a  specifically mandated allocation  Members and candidates must review managers as diligently  as they review individual funds and securities 
7,187,Members and candidates who are directly involved with the use of external advisers need to  ensure that their firms have standardized criteria for reviewing these selected external advisers  and managers  Such criteria would include but would not be limited to the following 
8,187,  reviewing the adviser s established code of ethics
9,187,  understanding the adviser s compliance and internal control procedures
10,187,  assessing the quality of the published return information and
11,187,  reviewing the adviser s investment process and adherence to its stated strategy 
12,187,Codes standards and guides to best practice published by CFA Institute provide members and  candidates with examples of acceptable practices for external advisers and advice in selecting a  new adviser  The following guides are available at the CFA Institute website   www cfainstitute org   Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct Global Investment  Performance Standards and Model Request for Proposal  for equity credit or real estate  managers

2,188,Group Research and Decision Making
3,188,Commonly members and candidates are part of a group or team that is collectively responsible  for producing investment analysis or research  The conclusions or recommendations of the  group report represent the consensus of the group and are not necessarily the views of the  member or candidate even though the name of the member or candidate is included on the  report  In some instances a member or candidate will not agree with the view of the group  If  however the member or candidate believes that the consensus opinion has a reasonable and  adequate basis and is independent and objective the member or candidate need not decline to  be identified with the report  If the member or candidate is confident in the process the member  or candidate does not need to dissociate from the report even if it does not reflect his or her  opinion 
4,188,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
5,188,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to consider the following policies and  procedures to support the principles of Standard V A  
6,188,  Establish a policy requiring that research reports credit ratings and investment  recommendations have a basis that can be substantiated as reasonable and adequate  An  individual employee  a supervisory analyst  or a group of employees  a review  committee  should be appointed to review and approve such items prior to external  circulation to determine whether the criteria established in the policy have been met 
7,188,  Develop detailed written guidance for analysts  research investment or credit   supervisory analysts and review committees that establishes the due diligence procedures  for judging whether a particular recommendation has a reasonable and adequate basis 
8,188,  Develop measurable criteria for assessing the quality of research the reasonableness and  adequacy of the basis for any recommendation or rating and the accuracy of  recommendations over time  In some cases firms may consider implementing  compensation arrangements that depend on these measurable criteria and that are applied  consistently to all related analysts 
9,188,  Develop detailed written guidance that establishes minimum levels of scenario testing of  all computer based models used in developing rating and evaluating financial  instruments  The policy should contain criteria related to the breadth of the scenarios  tested the accuracy of the output over time and the analysis of cash flow sensitivity to  inputs 
10,188,  Develop measurable criteria for assessing outside providers including the quality of  information being provided the reasonableness and adequacy of the provider s collection  practices and the accuracy of the information over time  The established policy should  outline how often the provider s products are reviewed 
11,188,  Adopt a standardized set of criteria for evaluating the adequacy of external advisers  The  policy should include how often and on what basis the allocation of funds to the adviser  will be reviewed

4,189,Helen Hawke manages the corporate finance department of Sarkozi Securities Ltd  The firm is  anticipating that the government will soon close a tax loophole that currently allows oil and gas  exploration companies to pass on drilling expenses to holders of a certain class of shares   Because market demand for this tax advantaged class of stock is currently high Sarkozi  convinces several companies to undertake new equity financings at once before the loophole  closes  Time is of the essence but Sarkozi lacks sufficient resources to conduct adequate  research on all the prospective issuing companies  Hawke decides to estimate the IPO prices on  the basis of the relative size of each company and to justify the pricing later when her staff has  time 
5,189,Comment  Sarkozi should have taken on only the work that it could adequately  handle  By categorizing the issuers by general size Hawke has bypassed  researching all the other relevant aspects that should be considered when pricing  new issues and thus has not performed sufficient due diligence  Such an omission  can result in investors purchasing shares at prices that have no actual basis  Hawke  has violated Standard V A  
6,189,Example    Sufficient Scenario Testing  
7,189,Babu Dhaliwal works for Heinrich Brokerage in the corporate finance group  He has just  persuaded Feggans Resources Ltd  to allow his firm to do a secondary equity financing at  Feggans Resources  current stock price  Because the stock has been trading at higher multiples  than similar companies with equivalent production Dhaliwal presses the Feggans Resources  managers to project what would be the maximum production they could achieve in an optimal  scenario  Based on these numbers he is able to justify the price his firm will be asking for the  secondary issue  During a sales pitch to the brokers Dhaliwal then uses these numbers as the  base case production levels that Feggans Resources will achieve 
8,189,Comment  When presenting information to the brokers Dhaliwal should have  given a range of production scenarios and the probability of Feggans Resources  achieving each level  By giving the maximum production level as the likely level of  production he has misrepresented the chances of achieving that production level  and seriously misled the brokers  Dhaliwal has violated Standard V A

2,191,Generally analysts must write research reports that reflect their own opinion and  can ask the firm not to put their name on reports that ultimately differ from that  opinion  When the work is a group effort however not all members of the team  may agree with all aspects of the report  Ultimately members and candidates can  ask to have their names removed from the report but if they are satisfied that the  process has produced results or conclusions that have a reasonable and adequate  basis members and candidates do not have to dissociate from the report even when  they do not agree with its contents  If Mastakis is confident in the process she does  not need to dissociate from the report even if it does not reflect her opinion

5,191,Comment  Members and candidates can rely on third party research but must make  reasonable and diligent efforts to determine that such research is sound  If  McDermott undertakes due diligence efforts on a regular basis to ensure that the  research produced by the large firm is objective and reasonably based McDermott  can rely on that research when making investment recommendations to clients

7,191,Paul Ostrowski s business has grown significantly over the past couple of years and some  clients want to diversify internationally  Ostrowski decides to find a submanager to handle the  expected international investments  Because this will be his first subadviser Ostrowski uses the  CFA Institute model  request for proposal  to design a questionnaire for his search  By his  deadline he receives seven completed questionnaires from a variety of domestic and  international firms trying to gain his business  Ostrowski reviews all the applications in detail  and decides to select the firm that charges the lowest fees because doing so will have the least  impact on his firm s bottom line 
8,191,Comment  The selection of an external adviser or subadviser should be based on a  full and complete review of the adviser s services performance history and cost  structure  In basing the decision on the fee structure alone Ostrowski may be  violating Standard V A

2,192,Example    Sufficient Due Diligence  
3,192,Michael Papis is the chief investment officer of his state s retirement fund  The fund has always  used outside advisers for the real estate allocation and this information is clearly presented in  all fund communications  Thomas Nagle a recognized sell side research analyst and Papis s  business school classmate recently left the investment bank he worked for to start his own asset  management firm Accessible Real Estate  Nagle is trying to build his assets under management  and contacts Papis about gaining some of the retirement fund s allocation  In the previous few  years the performance of the retirement fund s real estate investments was in line with the  fund s benchmark but was not extraordinary  Papis decides to help out his old friend and also to  seek better returns by moving the real estate allocation to Accessible  The only notice of the  change in adviser appears in the next annual report in the listing of associated advisers 
4,192,Comment  Papis violated Standard V A   His responsibilities may include the  selection of the external advisers but the decision to change advisers appears to  have been arbitrary  If Papis was dissatisfied with the current real estate adviser he  should have conducted a proper solicitation to select the most appropriate adviser

7,192,Andre Shrub owns and operates Conduit an investment advisory firm  Prior to opening  Conduit Shrub was an account manager with Elite Investment a hedge fund managed by his  good friend Adam Reed  To attract clients to a new Conduit fund Shrub offers lower than  normal management fees  He can do so because the fund consists of two top performing funds  managed by Reed  Given his personal friendship with Reed and the prior performance record of  these two funds Shrub believes this new fund is a winning combination for all parties  Clients  quickly invest with Conduit to gain access to the Elite funds  No one is turned away because  Conduit is seeking to expand its assets under management 
8,192,Comment  Shrub violated Standard V A  by not conducting a thorough analysis of  the funds managed by Reed before developing the new Conduit fund  Shrub s  reliance on his personal relationship with Reed and his prior knowledge of Elite are  insufficient justification for the investments  The funds may be appropriately  considered but a full review of their operating procedures reporting practices and  transparency are some elements of the necessary due diligence

2,193,Example     Sufficient Due Diligence  
3,193,Bob Thompson has been doing research for the portfolio manager of the fixed income  department  His assignment is to do sensitivity analysis on securitized subprime mortgages  He  has discussed with the manager possible scenarios to use to calculate expected returns  A key  assumption in such calculations is housing price appreciation  HPA  because it drives   prepays   prepayments of mortgages  and losses  Thompson is concerned with the significant  appreciation experienced over the previous five years as a result of the increased availability of  funds from subprime mortgages  Thompson insists that the analysis should include a scenario  run with      for Year       for Year   and then  to project a worst case scenario     for  Years   through    The manager replies that these assumptions are too dire because there has  never been a time in their available database when HPA was negative 
4,193,Thompson conducts his research to better understand the risks inherent in these securities and  evaluates these securities in the worst case scenario a less likely but possible environment   Based on the results of the enhanced scenarios Thompson does not recommend the purchase of  the securitization  Against the general market trends the manager follows Thompson s  recommendation and does not invest  The following year the housing market collapses  In  avoiding the subprime investments the manager s portfolio outperforms its peer group that  year 
5,193,Comment  Thompson s actions in running the scenario test with inputs beyond the  historical trends available in the firm s databases adhere to the principles of  Standard V A   His concerns over recent trends provide a sound basis for further  analysis  Thompson understands the limitations of his model when combined with  the limited available historical information to accurately predict the performance  of the funds if market conditions change negatively

8,193,Espacia Liakos works in sales for Hellenica Securities a firm specializing in developing  intricate derivative strategies to profit from particular views on market expectations  One of her  clients is Eugenie Carapalis who has become convinced that commodity prices will become  more volatile over the coming months  Carapalis asks Liakos to quickly engineer a strategy that  will benefit from this expectation  Liakos turns to Hellenica s modeling group to fulfill this  request  Because of the tight deadline the modeling group outsources parts of the work to  several trusted third parties  Liakos implements the disparate components of the strategy as the  firms complete them 
9,193,Within a month Carapalis is proven correct  Volatility across a range of commodities increases  sharply  But her derivatives position with Hellenica returns huge losses and the losses increase  daily  Liakos investigates and realizes that although each of the various components of the  strategy had been validated they had never been evaluated as an integrated whole  In extreme  conditions portions of the model worked at cross purposes with other portions causing the  overall strategy to fail dramatically

2,194,Comment  Liakos violated Standard V A   Members and candidates must  understand the statistical significance of the results of the models they recommend  and must be able to explain them to clients  Liakos did not take adequate care to  ensure a thorough review of the whole model  its components were evaluated only  individually  Because Carapalis clearly intended to implement the strategy as a  whole rather than as separate parts Liakos should have tested how the components  of the strategy interacted as well as how they performed individually

4,194,Alton Newbury is an investment adviser to high net worth clients  A client with an aggressive  risk profile in his investment policy statement asks about investing in the Top Shelf hedge fund   This fund based in Calgary Alberta Canada has reported     returns for the first three years   The fund prospectus states that its strategy involves long and short positions in the energy  sector and extensive leverage  Based on his analysis of the fund s track record the principals  involved in managing the fund the fees charged and the fund s risk profile Newbury  recommends the fund to the client and secures a position in it  The next week the fund  announces that it has suffered a loss of     of its value and is suspending operations and  redemptions until after a regulatory review  Newbury s client calls him in a panic and asks for  an explanation 
5,194,Comment  Newbury s actions were consistent with Standard V A   Analysis of an  investment that results in a reasonable basis for recommendation does not  guarantee that the investment has no downside risk  Newbury should discuss the  analysis process with the client while reminding him or her that past performance  does not lead to guaranteed future gains and that losses in an aggressive investment  portfolio should be expected

8,194,Comment  Cannon has violated Standard V A  by failing to have a reasonable basis  for the new recommendations made to the portfolio managers  He needed to  diligently research the effect of incorporating the new factors before offering the  output recommendations  Cannon may use the blog for ideas but it is his  responsibility to determine the effect on the firm s proprietary models

3,195,Ellen Smith is a performance analyst at Artic Global Advisors a firm that manages global  equity mandates for institutional clients  She was asked by her supervisor to review five new  performance attribution systems and recommend one that would more appropriately explain the  firm s investment strategy to clients  On the list was a system she recalled learning about when  visiting an exhibitor booth at a recent conference  The system is highly quantitative and  something of a  black box  in how it calculates the attribution values  Smith recommended this  option without researching the others because the sheer complexity of the process was sure to  impress the clients 
4,195,Comment  Smith s actions do not demonstrate a sufficient level of diligence in  reviewing this product to make a recommendation for selecting the service  Besides  not reviewing or considering the other four potential systems she did not determine  whether the  black box  attribution process aligns with the investment practices of  the firm including its investments in different countries and currencies  Smith must  review and understand the process of any software or system before recommending  its use as the firm s attribution system

7,195,Comment  By considering only performance and GIPS compliance Jackson has not  conducted sufficient review of potential firms to satisfy the requirements of  Standard V A   A thorough investigation of the firms and their operations should  be conducted to ensure that their addition would increase the diversity of clients   portfolios and that they are suitable for the fund of funds product

2,196,Comment  By failing to conduct any additional outside review of the information to  verify what was submitted through the request for proposal Green has likely not  satisfied the requirements of Standard V A   The amount of information requested  from outside managers varies among firms  Although the requested information  may be comprehensive Green should ensure sufficient effort is undertaken to  verify the submitted information before recommending a firm for inclusion  This  requires that he go beyond the information provided by the manager on the request  for proposal questionnaire and may include interviews with interested managers  reviews of regulatory filings and discussions with the managers  custodian or  auditor 
3,196,Example     Technical Model Requirements  
4,196,J r me Dupont works for the credit research group of XYZ Asset Management where he is in  charge of developing and updating credit risk models  In order to perform accurately his  models need to be regularly updated with the latest market data 
5,196,Dupont does not interact with or manage money for any of the firm s clients  He is in contact  with the firm s US corporate bond fund manager John Smith who has only very superficial  knowledge of the model and who from time to time asks very basic questions regarding the  output recommendations  Smith does not consult Dupont with respect to finalizing his clients   investment strategies 
6,196,Dupont s recently assigned objective is to develop a new emerging market corporate credit risk  model  The firm is planning to expand into emerging credit and the development of such a  model is a critical step in this process  Because Smith seems to follow the model s  recommendations without much concern for its quality as he develops his clients  investment  strategies Dupont decides to focus his time on the development of the new emerging market  model and neglects to update the US model 
7,196,After several months without regular updates Dupont s diagnostic statistics start to show  alarming signs with respect to the quality of the US credit model  Instead of conducting the long  and complicated data update Dupont introduces new codes into his model with some limited  new data as a quick  fix   He thinks this change will address the issue without needing to  complete the full data update so he continues working on the new emerging market model 
8,196,Several months following the quick  fix  another set of diagnostic statistics reveals nonsensical  results and Dupont realizes that his earlier change contained an error  He quickly corrects the  error and alerts Smith  Smith realizes that some of the prior trades he performed were due to  erroneous model results  Smith rebalances the portfolio to remove the securities purchased on  the basis of the questionable results without reporting the issue to anyone else 
9,196,Comment  Smith violated standard V A  because exercising  diligence  independence and thoroughness in analyzing investments making investment  recommendations and taking investment actions  means that members and  candidates must understand the technical aspects of the products they provide to  clients  Smith does not understand the model he is relying on to manage money   Members and candidates should also make reasonable enquiries into the source and  accuracy of all data used in completing their investment analysis and  recommendations

2,198,Standard V B  addresses member and candidate conduct with respect to communicating with  clients  Developing and maintaining clear frequent and thorough communication practices is  critical to providing high quality financial services to clients  When clients understand the  information communicated to them they also can understand exactly how members and  candidates are acting on their behalf which gives clients the opportunity to make well informed  decisions about their investments  Such understanding can be accomplished only through clear  communication 
3,198,Standard V B  states that members and candidates should communicate in a recommendation  the factors that were instrumental in making the investment recommendation  A critical part of  this requirement is to distinguish clearly between opinions and facts  In preparing a research  report the member or candidate must present the basic characteristics of the security ies  being  analyzed which will allow the reader to evaluate the report and incorporate information the  reader deems relevant to his or her investment decision making process 
4,198,Similarly in preparing a recommendation about for example an asset allocation strategy  alternative investment vehicle or structured investment product the member or candidate  should include factors that are relevant to the asset classes that are being discussed  Follow up  communication of significant changes in the risk characteristics of a security or asset strategy is  required  Providing regular updates to any changes in the risk characteristics is recommended 
5,198,Informing Clients of the Investment Process
6,198,Members and candidates must adequately describe to clients and prospective clients the manner  in which they conduct the investment decision making process  Such disclosure should address  factors that have positive and negative influences on the recommendations including significant  risks and limitations of the investment process used  The member or candidate must keep  clients and other interested parties informed on an ongoing basis about changes to the  investment process especially newly identified significant risks and limitations  Only by  thoroughly understanding the nature of the investment product or service can a client determine  whether changes to that product or service could materially affect his or her investment  objectives 
7,198,Understanding the basic characteristics of an investment is of great importance in judging the  suitability of that investment on a standalone basis but it is especially important in determining  the impact each investment will have on the characteristics of a portfolio  Although the risk and  return characteristics of a common stock might seem to be essentially the same for any investor  when the stock is viewed in isolation the effects of those characteristics greatly depend on the  other investments held  For instance if the particular stock will represent     of an  individual s investments the stock s importance in the portfolio is vastly different from what it  would be to an investor with a highly diversified portfolio for whom the stock will represent  only    of the holdings 
8,198,A firm s investment policy may include the use of outside advisers to manage various portions  of clients  assets under management  Members and candidates should inform the clients about  the specialization or diversification expertise provided by the external adviser s   This  information allows clients to understand the full mix of products and strategies being applied  that may affect their investment objectives

2,199,Different Forms of Communication
3,199,For purposes of Standard V B  communication is not confined to a written report of the type  traditionally generated by an analyst researching a security company or industry  A  presentation of information can be made via any means of communication including in person  recommendation or description telephone conversation media broadcast or transmission by  computer  e g  on the internet  
4,199,Computer and mobile device communications have rapidly evolved over the past few years   Members and candidates using any social media service to communicate business information  must be diligent in their efforts to avoid unintended problems because these services may not be  available to all clients  When providing information to clients through new technologies  members and candidates should take reasonable steps to ensure that such delivery would treat  all clients fairly and if necessary be considered publicly disseminated 
5,199,The nature of client communications is highly diverse from one word   buy  or  sell   to in  depth reports of more than     pages  A communication may contain a general  recommendation about the market asset allocations or classes of investments  e g  stocks  bonds real estate  or may relate to a specific security  If recommendations are contained in  capsule form  such as a recommended stock list  members and candidates should notify clients  that additional information and analyses are available from the producer of the report 
6,199,Identifying Risks and Limitations
7,199,Members and candidates must outline to clients and prospective clients significant risks and  limitations of the analysis contained in their investment products or recommendations  The type  and nature of significant risks will depend on the investment process that members and  candidates are following and on the personal circumstances of the client  In general the use of  leverage constitutes a significant risk and should be disclosed 
8,199,Members and candidates must adequately disclose the general market related risks and the risks  associated with the use of complex financial instruments that are deemed significant  Other  types of risks that members and candidates may consider disclosing include but are not limited  to counterparty risk country risk sector or industry risk security specific risk and credit risk 
9,199,Investment securities and vehicles may have limiting factors that influence a client s or  potential client s investment decision  Members and candidates must report to clients and  prospective clients the existence of limitations significant to the decision making process   Examples of such factors and attributes include but are not limited to investment liquidity and  capacity  Liquidity is the ability to liquidate an investment on a timely basis at a reasonable  cost  Capacity is the investment amount beyond which returns will be negatively affected by  new investments

2,200,The appropriateness of risk disclosure should be assessed on the basis of what was known at the  time the investment action was taken  often called an ex ante basis   Members and candidates  must disclose significant risks known to them at the time of the disclosure  Members and  candidates cannot be expected to disclose risks they are unaware of at the time  recommendations or investment actions are made  In assessing compliance with Standard V B   it is important to establish knowledge of a purported significant risk or limitation  A one time  investment loss that occurs after the disclosure does not constitute a pertinent factor in assessing  whether significant risks and limitations were properly disclosed  Having no knowledge of a  risk or limitation that subsequently triggers a loss may reveal a deficiency in the diligence and  reasonable basis of the research of the member or candidate but may not reveal a breach of  Standard V B  
3,200,Report Presentation
4,200,Once the analytical process has been completed the member or candidate who prepares the  report must include those elements that are important to the analysis and conclusions of the  report so that the reader can follow and challenge the report s reasoning  A report writer who  has done adequate investigation may emphasize certain areas touch briefly on others and omit  certain aspects deemed unimportant  For instance a report may dwell on a quarterly earnings  release or new product introduction and omit other matters as long as the analyst clearly  stipulates the limits to the scope of the report 
5,200,Investment advice based on quantitative research and analysis must be supported by readily  available reference material and should be applied in a manner consistent with previously  applied methodology  If changes in methodology are made they should be highlighted 
6,200,Distinction between Facts and Opinions in Reports
7,200,Standard V B  requires that opinion be separated from fact  Violations often occur when reports  fail to separate the past from the future by not indicating that earnings estimates changes in the  outlook for dividends or future market price information are opinions subject to future  circumstances 
8,200,In the case of complex quantitative analyses members and candidates must clearly separate fact  from statistical conjecture and should identify the known limitations of an analysis  Members  and candidates may violate Standard V B  by failing to identify the limits of statistically  developed projections because such omission leaves readers unaware of the limits of the  published projections 
9,200,Members and candidates should explicitly discuss with clients and prospective clients the  assumptions used in the investment models and processes to generate the analysis  Caution  should be used in promoting the perceived accuracy of any model or process to clients because  the ultimate output is merely an estimate of future results and not a certainty 
10,200,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
11,200,Because the selection of relevant factors is an analytical skill determination of whether a  member or candidate has used reasonable judgment in excluding and including information in  research reports depends heavily on case by case review rather than a specific checklist

2,201,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to have a rigorous methodology for  reviewing research that is created for publication and dissemination to clients

7,201,Comment  Williamson s plans for the newsletter violate Standard V B    Williamson need not describe the investment system in detail in order to implement  the advice effectively but she must inform clients of Country Technicians  basic  process and logic  Without understanding the basis for a recommendation clients  cannot possibly understand its limitations or its inherent risks

10,201,Comment  If Dox issues the report as written he will violate Standard V B   His  calculation of the total gold reserves for the property based on the company s  recent sample drilling is a quantitative opinion not a fact  Opinion must be  distinguished from fact in research reports

3,202,Olivia Thomas an analyst at Government Brokers Inc  which is a brokerage firm specializing  in government bond trading has produced a report that describes an investment strategy  designed to benefit from an expected decline in US interest rates  The firm s derivative products  group has designed a structured product that will allow the firm s clients to benefit from this  strategy  Thomas s report describing the strategy indicates that high returns are possible if  various scenarios for declining interest rates are assumed  Citing the proprietary nature of the  structured product underlying the strategy the report does not describe in detail how the firm is  able to offer such returns or the related risks in the scenarios nor does the report address the  likely returns of the strategy if contrary to expectations interest rates rise 
4,202,Comment  Thomas has violated Standard V B  because her report fails to describe  properly the basic characteristics of the actual and implied risks of the investment  strategy including how the structure was created and the degree to which leverage  was embedded in the structure  The report should include a balanced discussion of  how the strategy would perform in the case of rising as well as falling interest rates  preferably illustrating how the strategies might be expected to perform in the event  of a reasonable variety of interest rate and credit risk spread scenarios  If liquidity  issues are relevant with regard to the valuation of either the derivatives or the  underlying securities provisions the firm has made to address those risks should  also be disclosed

6,202,May   Associates is an aggressive growth manager that has represented itself since its  inception as a specialist at investing in small cap US stocks  One of May s selection criteria is a  maximum capitalization of US     million for any given company  After a string of successful  years of superior performance relative to its peers May has expanded its client base  significantly to the point at which assets under management now exceed US   billion  For  liquidity purposes May s chief investment officer  CIO  decides to lift the maximum  permissible market cap ceiling to US     million and change the firm s sales and marketing  literature accordingly to inform prospective clients and third party consultants 
7,202,Comment  Although May s CIO is correct about informing potentially interested  parties as to the change in investment process he must also notify May s existing  clients  Among the latter group might be a number of clients who not only retained  May as a small cap manager but also retained mid cap and large cap specialists in  a multiple manager approach  Such clients could regard May s change of criteria as  a style change that distorts their overall asset allocations

2,203,Comment  Standard V B  requires that May s CIO advise May s clients of this  change because the firm may have been retained by some clients specifically for its  prowess at investing in US small cap stocks  Other changes that require client  notification are introducing derivatives to emulate a certain market sector or  relaxing various other constraints such as portfolio beta  In all such cases  members and candidates must disclose changes to all interested parties

4,203,RJZ Capital Management is an active value style equity manager that selects stocks by using a  combination of four multifactor models  The firm has found favorable results when back testing  the most recent    years of available market data in a new dividend discount model  DDM   designed by the firm  This model is based on projected inflation rates earnings growth rates  and interest rates  The president of RJZ decides to replace its simple model that uses price to  trailing    month earnings with the new DDM 
5,203,Comment  Because the introduction of a new and different valuation model  represents a material change in the investment process RJZ s president must  communicate the change to the firm s clients  RJZ is moving away from a model  based on hard data toward a new model that is at least partly dependent on the  firm s forecasting skills  Clients would likely view such a model as a significant  change rather than a mere refinement of RJZ s process

4,204,Comment  Standard V B  requires the disclosure of the investment process used to  construct the portfolio of the fund  Changing the investment process from  managing all classes of investments within the firm to the use of external managers  is one example of information that needs to be communicated to clients  Chinn and  her firm have embraced the principles of Standard V B  by providing their client  with relevant information  The charity can now make a reasonable decision about  whether Diversified Asset Management remains the appropriate manager for its  fund

7,204,Comment  Papis has violated Standard V B   He attempted to hide the nature of his  decision to change external managers by making only a limited disclosure  The  plan recipients and the fund s trustees need to be aware when changes are made to  ensure that operational procedures are being followed

2,205,Dupont does not interact with or manage money for any of the firm s clients  He is in contact  with the firm s US corporate bond fund manager John Smith who has only very superficial  knowledge of the model and who from time to time asks very basic questions regarding the  output recommendations  Smith does not consult Dupont with respect to finalizing his clients   investment strategies 
3,205,Dupont s recently assigned objective is to develop a new emerging market corporate credit risk  model  The firm is planning to expand into emerging credit and the development of such a  model is a critical step in this process  Because Smith seems to follow the model s  recommendations without much concern for its quality as he develops his clients  investment  strategies Dupont decides to focus his time on the development of the new emerging market  model and neglects to update the US model 
4,205,After several months without regular updates Dupont s diagnostic statistics start to show  alarming signs with respect to the quality of the US credit model  Instead of conducting the long  and complicated data update Dupont introduces new codes into his model with some limited  new data as a quick  fix   He thinks this change will address the issue without needing to  complete the full data update so he continues working on the new emerging market model 
5,205,Several months following the quick  fix  another set of diagnostic statistics reveals nonsensical  results and Dupont realizes that his earlier change contained an error  He quickly corrects the  error and alerts Smith  Smith realizes that some of the prior trades he performed were due to  erroneous model results  Smith rebalances the portfolio to remove the securities purchased on  the basis of the questionable results without reporting the issue to anyone else 
6,205,Comment  Smith violated V B  by not disclosing a material error in the investment  process  Clients should have been informed about the error and the corrective  actions the firm was undertaking on their behalf

10,205,After two years the strategy has generated performance returns greater than the appropriate  benchmark and the Sharpe ratio of the fund is close to      On the basis of these results QSC  decides to actively market the fund to large institutional investors  While creating the offering  materials Yakovlev informs the marketing team that the capacity of the strategy is limited  The  extent of the limitation is difficult to ascertain with precision  it depends on market liquidity and  other factors in his model that can evolve over time  Yakovlev indicates that given the current  market conditions investments in the fund beyond US     million of capital could become  more difficult and negatively affect expected fund returns

3,206,Comment  Yakovlev and Wellard have not appropriately disclosed a significant  limitation associated with the investment product  Yakovlev believes this  limitation once reached will materially affect the returns of the fund  Although the  fund is currently far from the US     million mark current and prospective  investors must be made aware of this capacity issue  If significant limitations are  complicated to grasp and clients do not have the technical background required to  understand them Yakovlev and Wellard should either educate the clients or  ascertain whether the fund is suitable for each client

6,206,Comment  Ramon has not sufficiently communicated the risks associated with the  investment process to satisfy the requirements of Standard V B   The losses  predicted by a VaR analysis depend greatly on the inputs used in the model  The  size and probability of losses can differ significantly from what an individual  model predicts  Ramon must disclose how the inputs were selected and the  potential limitations and risks associated with the investment strategy

13,210,Best practice is to avoid actual conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest when possible   Conflicts of interest often arise in the investment profession  Conflicts can occur between the  interests of clients the interests of employers and the member s or candidate s own personal  interests  Common sources for conflict are compensation structures especially incentive and  bonus structures that provide immediate returns for members and candidates with little or no  consideration of long term value creation 
14,210,Identifying and managing these conflicts is a critical part of working in the investment industry  and can take many forms  When conflicts cannot be reasonably avoided clear and complete  disclosure of their existence is necessary

2,211,Standard VI A  protects investors and employers by requiring members and candidates to fully  disclose to clients potential clients and employers all actual and potential conflicts of interest   Once a member or candidate has made full disclosure the member s or candidate s employer  clients and prospective clients will have the information needed to evaluate the objectivity of  the investment advice or action taken on their behalf 
3,211,To be effective disclosures must be prominent and must be made in plain language and in a  manner designed to effectively communicate the information  Members and candidates have the  responsibility of determining how often in what manner and in what particular circumstances  the disclosure of conflicts must be made  Best practices dictate updating disclosures when the  nature of a conflict of interest changes materially for example if the nature of a conflict of  interest worsens through the introduction of bonuses based on each quarter s profits as to  opposed annual profits  In making and updating disclosures of conflicts of interest members  and candidates should err on the side of caution to ensure that conflicts are effectively  communicated 
4,211,Disclosure of Conflicts to Employers
5,211,Disclosure of conflicts to employers may be appropriate in many instances  When reporting  conflicts of interest to employers members and candidates must give their employers enough  information to assess the impact of the conflict  By complying with employer guidelines  members and candidates allow their employers to avoid potentially embarrassing and costly  ethical or regulatory violations 
6,211,Reportable situations include conflicts that would interfere with rendering unbiased investment  advice and conflicts that would cause a member or candidate to act not in the employer s best  interest  The same circumstances that generate conflicts to be reported to clients and prospective  clients also would dictate reporting to employers  Ownership of stocks analyzed or  recommended participation on outside boards and financial or other pressures that could  influence a decision are to be promptly reported to the employer so that their impact can be  assessed and a decision on how to resolve the conflict can be made 
7,211,The mere appearance of a conflict of interest may create problems for members candidates and  their employers  Therefore many of the conflicts previously mentioned could be explicitly  prohibited by an employer  For example many employers restrict personal trading outside  board membership and related activities to prevent situations that might not normally be  considered problematic from a conflict of interest point of view but that could give the  appearance of a conflict of interest  Members and candidates must comply with these  restrictions  Members and candidates must take reasonable steps to avoid conflicts and if they  occur inadvertently must report them promptly so that the employer and the member or  candidate can resolve them as quickly and effectively as possible 
8,211,Standard VI A  also deals with a member s or candidate s conflicts of interest that might be  detrimental to the employer s business  Any potential conflict situation that could prevent clear  judgment about or full commitment to the execution of a member s or candidate s duties to the  employer should be reported to the member s or candidate s employer and promptly resolved

2,212,Disclosure to Clients
3,212,Members and candidates must maintain their objectivity when rendering investment advice or  taking investment action  Investment advice or actions may be perceived to be tainted in  numerous situations  Can a member or candidate remain objective if on behalf of the firm the  member or candidate obtains or assists in obtaining fees for services  Can a member or  candidate give objective advice if he or she owns stock in the company that is the subject of an  investment recommendation or if the member or candidate has a close personal relationship  with the company managers  Requiring members and candidates to disclose all matters that  reasonably could be expected to impair the member s or candidate s objectivity allows clients  and prospective clients to judge motives and possible biases for themselves 
4,212,Often in the investment industry a conflict or the perception of a conflict cannot be avoided   The most obvious conflicts of interest which should always be disclosed are relationships  between an issuer and the member the candidate or his or her firm  such as a directorship or  consultancy by a member  investment banking underwriting and financial relationships   broker dealer market making activities  and material beneficial ownership of stock   For the  purposes of Standard VI A  members and candidates beneficially own securities or other  investments if they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in the securities have the power  to vote or direct the voting of the shares of the securities or investments or have the power to  dispose or direct the disposition of the security or investment 
5,212,A member or candidate must take reasonable steps to determine whether a conflict of interest  exists and disclose to clients any known conflicts of the member s or candidate s firm   Disclosure of broker dealer market making activities alerts clients that a purchase or sale might  be made from or to the firm s principal account and that the firm has a special interest in the  price of the stock 
6,212,Additionally disclosures should be made to clients regarding fee arrangements subadvisory  agreements or other situations involving nonstandard fee structures  Equally important is the  disclosure of arrangements in which the firm benefits directly from investment  recommendations  An obvious conflict of interest is the rebate of a portion of the service fee  some classes of mutual funds charge to investors  Members and candidates should ensure that  their firms disclose such relationships so clients can fully understand the costs of their  investments and the benefits received by their investment manager s employer 
7,212,Cross Departmental Conflicts
8,212,Other circumstances can give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest  For instance a sell  side analyst working for a broker dealer may be encouraged not only by members of her or his  own firm but by corporate issuers themselves to write research reports about particular  companies  The buy side analyst is likely to be faced with similar conflicts as banks exercise  their underwriting and security dealing powers  The marketing division may ask an analyst to  recommend the stock of a certain company in order to obtain business from that company 
9,212,The potential for conflicts of interest also exists with broker sponsored limited partnerships  formed to invest venture capital  Increasingly members and candidates are expected not only to  follow issues from these partnerships once they are offered to the public but also to promote the  issues in the secondary market after public offerings  Members candidates and their firms  should attempt to resolve situations presenting potential conflicts of interest or disclose them in  accordance with the principles set forth in Standard VI A

2,213,Conflicts with Stock Ownership
3,213,The most prevalent conflict requiring disclosure under Standard VI A  is a member s or  candidate s ownership of stock in companies that he or she recommends to clients or that clients  hold  Clearly the easiest method for preventing a conflict is to prohibit members and candidates  from owning any such securities but this approach is overly burdensome and discriminates  against members and candidates 
4,213,Therefore sell side members and candidates should disclose any materially beneficial  ownership interest in a security or other investment that the member or candidate is  recommending  Buy side members and candidates should disclose their procedures for  reporting requirements for personal transactions  Conflicts arising from personal investing are  discussed more fully in the guidance for Standard VI B  
5,213,Conflicts as a Director
6,213,Service as a director poses three basic conflicts of interest  First a conflict may exist between  the duties owed to clients and the duties owed to shareholders of the company  Second  investment personnel who serve as directors may receive the securities or options to purchase  securities of the company as compensation for serving on the board which could raise  questions about trading actions that might increase the value of those securities  Third board  service creates the opportunity to receive material nonpublic information involving the  company  Even though the information is confidential the perception could be that information  not available to the public is being communicated to a director s firm whether a broker  investment adviser or other type of organization  When members or candidates providing  investment services also serve as directors they should be isolated from those making  investment decisions by the use of firewalls or similar restrictions 
7,213,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
8,213,Members or candidates should disclose special compensation arrangements with the employer  that might conflict with client interests such as bonuses based on short term performance  criteria commissions incentive fees performance fees and referral fees  If the member s or  candidate s firm does not permit such disclosure the member or candidate should document the  request and may consider dissociating from the activity 
9,213,Members  and candidates  firms are encouraged to include information on compensation  packages in firms  promotional literature  If a member or candidate manages a portfolio for  which the fee is based on capital gains or capital appreciation  a performance fee  this  information should be disclosed to clients  If a member a candidate or a member s or  candidate s firm has outstanding agent options to buy stock as part of the compensation package  for corporate financing activities the amount and expiration date of these options should be  disclosed as a footnote to any research report published by the member s or candidate s firm

4,214,Comment  Weiss must disclose in his research report Farmington s special  relationship with Vimco  Broker dealer management of and participation in public  offerings must be disclosed in research reports  Because the position of underwriter  to a company entails a special past and potential future relationship with a company  that is the subject of investment advice it threatens the independence and  objectivity of the report writer and must be disclosed

4,215,Samantha Snead a portfolio manager for Thomas Investment Counsel Inc  specializes in  managing public retirement funds and defined benefit pension plan accounts all of which have  long term investment objectives  A year ago Snead s employer in an attempt to motivate and  retain key investment professionals introduced a bonus compensation system that rewards  portfolio managers on the basis of quarterly performance relative to their peers and to certain  benchmark indexes  In an attempt to improve the short term performance of her accounts  Snead changes her investment strategy and purchases several high beta stocks for client  portfolios  These purchases are seemingly contrary to the clients  investment policy statements   Following their purchase an officer of Griffin Corporation one of Snead s pension fund clients  asks why Griffin Corporation s portfolio seems to be dominated by high beta stocks of  companies that often appear among the most actively traded issues  No change in objective or  strategy has been recommended by Snead during the year 
5,215,Comment  Snead has violated Standard VI A  by failing to inform her clients of the  changes in her compensation arrangement with her employer which created a  conflict of interest between her compensation and her clients  IPSs  Firms may pay  employees on the basis of performance but pressure by Thomas Investment  Counsel to achieve short term performance goals is in basic conflict with the  objectives of Snead s accounts

7,216,Comment  By failing to inform Universal of her involvement with Chelsea Corky  violated Standard VI A   Given the large size of the endowment at Chelsea  Corky s new role as a trustee can reasonably be expected to be time consuming to  the possible detriment of Corky s portfolio responsibilities with Universal  Also as  a trustee Corky may become involved in the investment decisions at Chelsea   Therefore Standard VI A  obligates Corky to discuss becoming a trustee at  Chelsea with her compliance officer or supervisor at Universal before accepting the  position and she should have disclosed the degree to which she would be involved  in investment decisions at Chelsea

4,219,  Impact on All Accounts with Beneficial Ownership
5,219,Standard VI B  reinforces the responsibility of members and candidates to give the interests of  their clients and employers priority over their personal financial interests  This standard is  designed to prevent any potential conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest  with respect to personal transactions  Client interests have priority  Client transactions must take  precedence over transactions made on behalf of the member s or candidate s firm or personal  transactions 
6,219,Avoiding Potential Conflicts
7,219,Conflicts between the client s interest and an investment professional s personal interest may  occur  Although conflicts of interest exist nothing is inherently unethical about individual  managers advisers or mutual fund employees making money from personal investments as  long as     the client is not disadvantaged by the trade     the investment professional does not  benefit personally from trades undertaken for clients and     the investment professional  complies with applicable regulatory requirements 
8,219,Some situations occur where a member or candidate may need to enter a personal transaction  that runs counter to current recommendations or what the portfolio manager is doing for client  portfolios  For example a member or candidate may be required at some point to sell an asset to  make a college tuition payment or a down payment on a home to meet a margin call or so on   The sale may be contrary to the long term advice the member or candidate is currently  providing to clients  In these situations the same three criteria given in the preceding paragraph  should be applied in the transaction so as to not violate Standard VI B  
9,219,Personal Trading Secondary to Trading for Clients
10,219,Standard VI B  states that transactions for clients and employers must have priority over  transactions in securities or other investments for which a member or candidate is the beneficial  owner  The objective of the standard is to prevent personal transactions from adversely  affecting the interests of clients or employers  A member or candidate having the same  investment positions or being co invested with clients does not always create a conflict  Some  clients in certain investment situations require members or candidates to have aligned interests   Personal investment positions or transactions of members or candidates or their firm should  never however adversely affect client investments

2,220,Standards for Nonpublic Information
3,220,Standard VI B  covers the activities of members and candidates who have knowledge of  pending transactions that may be made on behalf of their clients or employers who have access  to nonpublic information during the normal preparation of research recommendations or who  take investment actions  Members and candidates are prohibited from conveying nonpublic  information to any person whose relationship to the member or candidate makes the member or  candidate a beneficial owner of the person s securities  Members and candidates must not  convey this information to any other person if the nonpublic information can be deemed  material 
4,220,Impact on All Accounts with Beneficial Ownership
5,220,Members or candidates may undertake transactions in accounts for which they are a beneficial  owner only after their clients and employers have had adequate opportunity to act on a  recommendation  Personal transactions include those made for the member s or candidate s  own account for family  including spouse children and other immediate family members   accounts and for accounts in which the member or candidate has a direct or indirect pecuniary  interest such as a trust or retirement account  Family accounts that are client accounts should be  treated like any other firm account and should neither be given special treatment nor be  disadvantaged because of the family relationship  If a member or candidate has a beneficial  ownership in the account however the member or candidate may be subject to preclearance or  reporting requirements of the employer or applicable law 
6,220,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
7,220,Policies and procedures designed to prevent potential conflicts of interest and even the  appearance of a conflict of interest with respect to personal transactions are critical to  establishing investor confidence in the securities industry  Therefore members and candidates  should urge their firms to establish such policies and procedures  Because investment firms vary  greatly in assets under management types of clients number of employees and so on each  firm should have policies regarding personal investing that are best suited to the firm  Members  and candidates should then prominently disclose these policies to clients and prospective  clients 
8,220,The specific provisions of each firm s standards will vary but all firms should adopt certain  basic procedures to address the conflict areas created by personal investing  These procedures  include the following 
9,220,  Limited participation in equity IPOs  Some eagerly awaited IPOs rise significantly in  value shortly after the issue is brought to market  Because the new issue may be highly  attractive and sought after the opportunity to participate in the IPO may be limited   Therefore purchases of IPOs by investment personnel create conflicts of interest in two  principal ways  First participation in an IPO may have the appearance of taking away an  attractive investment opportunity from clients for personal gain a clear breach of the  duty of loyalty to clients  Second personal purchases in IPOs may have the appearance  that the investment opportunity is being bestowed as an incentive to make future  investment decisions for the benefit of the party providing the opportunity  Members and  candidates can avoid these conflicts or appearances of conflicts of interest by not  participating in IPOs

2,221,Reliable and systematic review procedures should be established to ensure that conflicts  relating to IPOs are identified and appropriately dealt with by supervisors  Members and  candidates should preclear their participation in IPOs even in situations without any  conflict of interest between a member s or candidate s participation in an IPO and the  client s interests  Members and candidates should not benefit from the position that their  clients occupy in the marketplace through preferred trading the allocation of limited  offerings or oversubscription 
3,221,  Restrictions on private placements  Strict limits should be placed on investment  personnel acquiring securities in private placements and appropriate supervisory and  review procedures should be established to prevent noncompliance 
4,221,Firms do not routinely use private placements for clients  e g  venture capital deals   because of the high risk associated with them  Conflicts related to private placements are  more significant to members and candidates who manage large pools of assets or act as  plan sponsors because these managers may be offered special opportunities such as  private placements as a reward or an enticement for continuing to do business with a  particular broker 
5,221,Participation in private placements raises conflict of interest issues that are similar to  issues surrounding IPOs  Investment personnel should not be involved in transactions  including  but not limited to  private placements that could be perceived as favors or  gifts that seem designed to influence future judgment or to reward past business deals 
6,221,Whether the venture eventually proves to be good or bad managers have an immediate  conflict concerning private placement opportunities  If and when the investments go  public participants in private placements have an incentive to recommend the  investments to clients regardless of the suitability of the investments for their clients   Doing so increases the value of the participants  personal portfolios 
7,221,  Establish blackout restricted periods  Investment personnel involved in the investment  decision making process should establish blackout periods prior to trades for clients so  that managers cannot take advantage of their knowledge of client activity by  front  running  client trades  trading for one s personal account before trading for client  accounts  
8,221,Individual firms must decide who within the firm should be required to comply with the  trading restrictions  At a minimum all individuals who are involved in the investment  decision making process should be subject to the same restricted period  Each firm must  determine specific requirements related to blackout and restricted periods that are most  relevant to the firm while ensuring that the procedures are governed by the guiding  principles set forth in the Code and Standards  Size of firm and type of securities  purchased are relevant factors  For example in a large firm a blackout requirement is in  effect a total trading ban because the firm is continually trading in most securities  In a  small firm the blackout period is more likely to prevent the investment manager from  front running 
9,221,  Reporting requirements  Supervisors should establish reporting procedures for investment  personnel including disclosure of personal holdings beneficial ownerships confirmations  of trades to the firm and the employee and preclearance procedures  Once trading  restrictions are in place they must be enforced  The best method for monitoring and  enforcing procedures to eliminate conflicts of interest in personal trading is through  reporting requirements including the following

5,223,Comment  Toffler has violated Standard VI B  by breaching her duty to her parents  by treating them differently from her other accounts simply because of the family  relationship  As fee paying clients of Esposito Investments Toffler s parents are  entitled to the same treatment as any other client of the firm  If Toffler has  beneficial ownership in the account however and Esposito Investments has  preclearance and reporting requirements for personal transactions she may have to  preclear the trades and report the transactions to Esposito

4,224,Comment  Riley did not give customers an opportunity to buy or sell in the options  market before the firm itself did  By taking action before the report was  disseminated Riley s firm may have depressed the price of the calls and increased  the price of the puts  The firm could have avoided a conflict of interest if it had  waited to trade for its own account until its clients had an opportunity to receive  and assimilate Wilson s recommendations  As it is Riley s actions violated  Standard VI B

11,225,Comment  White has violated Standard VI C  by failing to inform the prospective  customer of the referral fee payable in services and commissions for an indefinite  period to Brady Securities  Such disclosure could have caused Branch to reassess  Hill s recommendation and make a more critical evaluation of Lewis Brothers   services

3,227,The sponsor of a state employee pension is seeking to hire a firm to manage the pension plan s  emerging market allocation  To assist in the review process the sponsor has hired Thomas  Arrow as a consultant to solicit proposals from various advisers  Arrow is contracted by the  sponsor to represent its best interest in selecting the most appropriate new manager  The process  runs smoothly and Overseas Investments is selected as the new manager 
4,227,The following year news breaks that Arrow is under investigation by the local regulator for  accepting kickbacks from investment managers after they are awarded new pension allocations   Overseas Investments is included in the list of firms allegedly making these payments   Although the sponsor is happy with the performance of Overseas since it has been managing the  pension plan s emerging market funds the sponsor still decides to have an independent review  of the proposals and the selection process to ensure that Overseas was the appropriate firm for  its needs  This review confirms that even though Arrow was being paid by both parties the  recommendation of Overseas appeared to be objective and appropriate 
5,227,Comment  Arrow has violated Standard VI C  because he did not disclose the fee  being paid by Overseas  Withholding this information raises the question of a  potential lack of objectivity in the recommendation of Overseas by Arrow  this  aspect is in addition to questions about the legality of having firms pay to be  considered for an allocation 
6,227,Regulators and governmental agencies may adopt requirements concerning  allowable consultant activities  Local regulations sometimes include having a  consultant register with the regulatory agency s ethics board  Regulator policies  may include a prohibition on acceptance of payments from investment managers  receiving allocations and require regular reporting of contributions made to  political organizations and candidates  Arrow would have to adhere to these  requirements as well as the Code and Standards

10,230,Comment  Nero and the two candidates have violated Standard VII A   By giving  information about the exam questions to two candidates Nero provided an unfair  advantage to the two candidates and undermined the integrity and validity of the  Level II exam as an accurate measure of the knowledge skills and abilities  necessary to earn the right to use the CFA designation  By accepting the  information the candidates also compromised the integrity and validity of the  Level II exam and undermined the ethical framework that is a key part of the  designation

4,231,Comment  Because Sullivan wrote down information from the Candidate Body of  Knowledge  CBOK  and took that written information into the exam room his  conduct compromised the validity of his exam performance and violated Standard  VII A   Sullivan s conduct was also in direct contradiction with the rules and  regulations of the CFA Program the Candidate Pledge and the CFA Institute Code  and Standards

10,231,Comment  Rossi did not violate Standard VII A  when she wrote about how  difficult she found the exam or how well she thinks she may have done  By  revealing portions of the CBOK covered on the exam and areas not covered  however she did violate Standard VII A  and the Candidate Pledge  Depending on  the time frame in which the comments were posted Rossi not only may have  assisted future candidates but also may have provided an unfair advantage to  candidates yet to sit for the same exam thereby undermining the integrity and  validity of the Level II exam

7,232,Comment  Pena has violated Standard VII A  by disclosing a portion of the exam  questions  The information provided is considered confidential until publicly  released by CFA Institute  CFA Sure is likely to use such feedback to refine its  review materials for future candidates  Pena s sharing of the specific questions  undermines the integrity of the exam while potentially making the exam easier for  future candidates

9,234,  remit annually to CFA Institute a completed Professional Conduct Statement which  renews the commitment to abide by the requirements of the Code and Standards and the  CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program and
10,234,  pay applicable CFA Institute membership dues on an annual basis 
11,234,If a CFA Institute member fails to meet any of these requirements the individual is no longer  considered an active member  Until membership is reactivated individuals must not present  themselves to others as active members  They may state however that they were CFA Institute  members in the past or refer to the years when their membership was active 
12,234,Using the CFA Designation
13,234,Those who have earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst designation are  encouraged to do so but only in a manner that does not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning  or implications of the designation  The use of the designation may be accompanied by an  accurate explanation of the requirements that have been met to earn the right to use the  designation

2,235, CFA charterholders  are those individuals who have earned the right to use the CFA  designation granted by CFA Institute  These people have satisfied certain requirements  including completion of the CFA Program and required years of acceptable work experience   Once granted the right to use the designation individuals must also satisfy the CFA Institute  membership requirements  see above  to maintain their right to use the designation

4,235,Given the growing popularity of social media where individuals may anonymously express  their opinions pseudonyms or online profile names created to hide a member s identity should  not be tagged with the CFA designation 
5,235,Use of the CFA designation by a CFA charterholder is governed by the terms and conditions of  the annual Professional Conduct Statement Agreement entered into between CFA Institute and  its membership prior to commencement of use of the CFA designation and reaffirmed annually 
6,235,Referring to Candidacy in the CFA Program
7,235,Candidates in the CFA Program may refer to their participation in the CFA Program but such  references must clearly state that an individual is a candidate in the CFA Program and must not  imply that the candidate has achieved any type of partial designation  A person is a candidate in  the CFA Program if
8,235,  the person s application for registration in the CFA Program has been accepted by CFA  Institute as evidenced by issuance of a notice of acceptance and the person is enrolled to  sit for a specified examination or
9,235,  the registered person has sat for a specified examination but exam results have not yet  been received 
10,235,If an individual is registered for the CFA Program but declines to sit for an exam or otherwise  does not meet the definition of a candidate as described in the CFA Institute Bylaws then that  individual is no longer considered an active candidate  Once the person is enrolled to sit for a  future examination his or her CFA Program candidacy resumes 
11,235,CFA Program candidates must never state or imply that they have a partial designation as a  result of passing one or more levels or cite an expected completion date of any level of the CFA  Program  Final award of the charter is subject to meeting the CFA Program requirements and  approval by the CFA Institute Board of Governors 
12,235,If a candidate passes each level of the exam in consecutive years and wants to state that he or  she did so that is not a violation of Standard VII B  because it is a statement of fact  If the  candidate then goes on to claim or imply superior ability by obtaining the designation in only  three years however he or she is in violation of Standard VII B

8,236,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
9,236,Misuse of a member s CFA designation or CFA candidacy or improper reference to it is  common by those in a member s or candidate s firm who do not possess knowledge of the  requirements of Standard VII B   As an appropriate step to reduce this risk members and  candidates should disseminate written information about Standard VII B  and the  accompanying guidance to their firm s legal compliance public relations and marketing  departments  see www cfainstitute org  
10,236,For materials that refer to employees  affiliation with CFA Institute members and candidates  should encourage their firms to create templates that are approved by a central authority  such  as the compliance department  as being consistent with Standard VII B   This practice promotes  consistency and accuracy in the firm of references to CFA Institute membership the CFA  designation and CFA candidacy

2,237,Example    Passing Exams in Consecutive Years  
3,237,An advertisement for AZ Investment Advisors states that all the firm s principals are CFA  charterholders and all passed the three examinations on their first attempt  The advertisement  prominently links this fact to the notion that AZ s mutual funds have achieved superior  performance 
4,237,Comment  AZ may state that all principals passed the three examinations on the  first try as long as this statement is true but it must not be linked to performance or  imply superior ability  Implying that     CFA charterholders achieve better  investment results and     those who pass the exams on the first try may be more  successful than those who do not violates Standard VII B  
5,237,Example    Right to Use CFA Designation  
6,237,Five years after receiving his CFA charter Louis Vasseur resigns his position as an investment  analyst and spends the next two years traveling abroad  Because he is not actively engaged in  the investment profession he does not file a completed Professional Conduct Statement with  CFA Institute and does not pay his CFA Institute membership dues  At the conclusion of his  travels Vasseur becomes a self employed analyst accepting assignments as an independent  contractor  Without reinstating his CFA Institute membership by filing his Professional Conduct  Statement and paying his dues he prints business cards that display  CFA  after his name 
7,237,Comment  Vasseur has violated Standard VII B  because his right to use the CFA  designation was suspended when he failed to file his Professional Conduct  Statement and stopped paying dues  Therefore he no longer is able to state or  imply that he is an active CFA charterholder  When Vasseur files his Professional  Conduct Statement resumes paying CFA Institute dues to activate his membership  and completes the CFA Institute reinstatement procedures he will be eligible to use  the CFA designation 
8,237,Example     Retired  CFA Institute Membership Status  
9,237,After a    year career James Simpson retires from his firm  Because he is not actively engaged  in the investment profession he does not file a completed Professional Conduct Statement with  CFA Institute and does not pay his CFA Institute membership dues  Simpson designs a plain  business card  without a corporate logo  to hand out to friends with his new contact details and  he continues to put  CFA  after his name 
10,237,Comment  Simpson has violated Standard VII B   Because he failed to file his  Professional Conduct Statement and ceased paying dues his membership has been  suspended and he has given up the right to use the CFA designation  CFA Institute  has procedures however for reclassifying a member and charterholder as  retired   and reducing the annual dues  If he wants to obtain retired status he needs to file  the appropriate paperwork with CFA Institute  When Simpson receives his  notification from CFA Institute that his membership has been reclassified as retired  and he resumes paying reduced dues his membership will be reactivated and his  right to use the CFA designation will be reinstated

4,238,Comment  Reese s comments comply with Standard VII B   Her statements refer to  facts  The CFA Program enhanced her knowledge and many firms require the  CFA designation for their investment professionals

6,250,   The correct answer is B  This question involves Standard III B  Fair Dealing  Smith  disseminated a change in the stock recommendation to his clients but then received a  request contrary to that recommendation from a client who probably had not yet received  the recommendation  Prior to executing the order Smith should take additional steps to  ensure that the customer has received the change of recommendation  Answer A is  incorrect because the client placed the order prior to receiving the recommendation and  therefore does not have the benefit of Smith s most recent recommendation  Answer C is  also incorrect  simply because the client request is contrary to the firm s recommendation  does not mean a member can override a direct request by a client  After Smith contacts  the client to ensure that the client has received the changed recommendation if the client  still wants to place a buy order for the shares Smith is obligated to comply with the  client s directive 
7,250,   The correct answer is C  This question involves Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and  Care and the specific topic of soft dollars or soft commissions  Answer C is the correct  choice because client brokerage commissions may not be directed to pay for the  investment manager s operating expenses  Answer B describes how members and  candidates should determine how to use brokerage commissions that is if the use is in  the best interests of clients and is commensurate with the value of the services provided   Answer A describes a practice that is commonly referred to as  directed brokerage    Because brokerage is an asset of the client and is used to benefit the client not the  manager such practice does not violate a duty of loyalty to the client  Members and  candidates are obligated in all situations to disclose to clients their practices in the use of  client brokerage commissions

2,251,   The correct answer is C  This question asks about compliance procedures relating to  personal investments of members and candidates  The statement in answer C clearly  conflicts with the recommended procedures in the Standards of Practice Handbook   Employers should compare personal transactions of employees with those of clients on a  regular basis regardless of the existence of a requirement by any regulatory organization   Such comparisons ensure that employees  personal trades do not conflict with their duty  to their clients and the comparisons can be conducted in a confidential manner  The  statement in answer A does not conflict with the procedures in the Handbook  Disclosure  of such policies will give full information to clients regarding potential conflicts of  interest on the part of those entrusted to manage their money  Answer B is incorrect  because firms are encouraged to establish policies whereby employees clear their  personal holdings and transactions with their employers 
3,251,   The correct answer is B  This question relates to Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and  Care and Standard III E  Preservation of Confidentiality  In this case the member  manages funds of a private endowment  Clients who are in this case the trustees of the  fund must place some trust in members and candidates  Bronson cannot disclose  confidential financial information to anyone without the permission of the fund  regardless of whether the disclosure may benefit the fund  Therefore answer A is  incorrect  Answer C is incorrect because Bronson must notify the fund and obtain the  fund s permission before publicizing the information 
4,251,   The correct answer is C  Under Standard IV C  Responsibilities of Supervisors members  and candidates may delegate supervisory duties to subordinates but such delegation does  not relieve members or candidates of their supervisory responsibilities  As a result  answer B is incorrect  Moreover whether or not Miller s subordinates are subject to the  Code and Standards is irrelevant to her supervisory responsibilities  Therefore answer A is incorrect 
5,251,   The correct answer is B  This question relates to Standard V A  Diligence and  Reasonable Basis  The opinion of another financial analyst is not an adequate basis for  Willier s action in changing the recommendation  Answer C is thus incorrect  So is  answer A because although it is true that members and candidates must distinguish  between facts and opinions in recommendations the question does not illustrate a  violation of that nature  If the opinion overheard by Willier had sparked him to conduct  additional research and investigation that justified a change of opinion then a changed  recommendation would be appropriate 
6,251,   The correct answer is B  This question relates to Standard I B  Independence and  Objectivity  When asked to change a recommendation on a company stock to gain  business for the firm the head of the brokerage unit must refuse in order to maintain his  independence and objectivity in making recommendations  He must not yield to pressure  by the firm s investment banking department  To avoid the appearance of a conflict of  interest the firm should discontinue issuing recommendations about the company   Answer A is incorrect  changing the recommendation in any manner that is contrary to  the analyst s opinion violates the duty to maintain independence and objectivity  Answer  C is incorrect because merely assigning a new analyst to decide whether the stock  deserves a higher rating will not address the conflict of interest

2,252,   The correct answer is A  Standard VII B  Reference to CFA Institute the CFA  Designation and the CFA Program is the subject of this question  The reference on  Albert s business card implies that there is a  CFA Level II  designation  Tye merely  indicates in promotional material that he is participating in the CFA Program and has  completed Levels I and II  Candidates may not imply that there is some sort of partial  designation earned after passing a level of the CFA exam  Therefore Albert has violated  Standard VII B   Candidates may communicate that they are participating in the CFA  Program however and may state the levels that they have completed  Therefore Tye has  not violated Standard VII B  
3,252,    The correct answer is B  This question relates to Standard V B  Communication with  Clients and Prospective Clients  Scott has issued a research report stating that he expects  the price of Walkton Industries stock to rise by US   a share  because the dividend will  increase  by US      per share  He has made this statement knowing that the dividend  will increase only if Congress enacts certain legislation an uncertain prospect  By stating  that the dividend will increase Scott failed to separate fact from opinion 
4,252,The information regarding passage of legislation is not material nonpublic information  because it is conjecture and the question does not state whether the US representative  gave Scott her opinion on the passage of the legislation in confidence  She could have  been offering this opinion to anyone who asked  Therefore statement A is incorrect  It  may be acceptable to base a recommendation in part on an expectation of future events  even though they may be uncertain  Therefore answer C is incorrect 
5,252,    The correct answer is C  This question which relates to Standard III B  Fair Dealing  tests the knowledge of the procedures that will assist members and candidates in treating  clients fairly when making investment recommendations  The step listed in C will help  ensure the fair treatment of clients  Answer A may have negative effects on the fair  treatment of clients  The more people who know about a pending change the greater the  chance that someone will inform some clients before the information s release  The firm  should establish policies that limit the number of people who are aware in advance that a  recommendation is to be disseminated  Answer B distributing recommendations to  institutional clients before distributing them to individual accounts discriminates among  clients on the basis of size and class of assets and is a violation of Standard III B  
6,252,    The correct answer is B  This question deals with Standard II A  Material Nonpublic  Information  The mosaic theory states that an analyst may use material public information  and nonmaterial nonpublic information in creating a larger picture than shown by any  individual piece of information and the conclusions the analyst reaches become material  only after the pieces are assembled  Answers A and C are accurate statements relating to  the Code and Standards but do not describe the mosaic theory 
7,252,    The correct answer is C  This question involves Standard IV B  Additional  Compensation Arrangements  The arrangement described in the question whereby  Jurgen would be compensated beyond the compensation provided by her firm on the  basis of an account s performance is not a violation of the Standards as long as Jurgen  discloses the arrangement in writing to her employer and obtains permission from her  employer prior to entering into the arrangement  Answers A and B are incorrect  although  the private compensation arrangement could conflict with the interests of other clients  and lead to short term performance pressures members and candidates may enter into  such agreements as long as they have disclosed the arrangements to their employer and  obtained permission for the arrangement from their employer

2,253,    The correct answer is B  This question relates to Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and  Care specifically a member s or candidate s responsibility for voting proxies and the  use of client brokerage  According to the facts stated in the question Farnsworth did not  violate Standard III A   Although the company president asked Farnsworth to vote the  shares of the Jones Corporation profit sharing plan a certain way Farnsworth investigated  the issue and concluded independently the best way to vote  Therefore even though his  decision coincided with the wishes of the company president Farnsworth is not in  violation of his responsibility to be loyal and to provide care to his clients  In this case  the participants and the beneficiaries of the profit sharing plan are the clients not the  company s management  Had Farnsworth not investigated the issue or had he yielded to  the president s wishes and voted for a slate of directors that he had determined was not in  the best interest of the company Farnsworth would have violated his responsibilities to  the beneficiaries of the plan  In addition because the brokerage firm provides the lowest  commissions and best execution for securities transactions Farnsworth has met his  obligations to the client in using this brokerage firm  It does not matter that the brokerage  firm also provides research information that is not useful for the account generating the  commission because Farnsworth is not paying extra money of the client s for that  information 
3,253,    The correct answer is A  In this question Brown is providing investment  recommendations before making inquiries about the client s financial situation  investment experience or investment objectives  Brown is thus violating Standard III C   Suitability  Answers B and C provide examples of information members and candidates  should discuss with their clients at the outset of the relationship but these answers do not  constitute a complete list of those factors  Answer A is the best answer 
4,253,    The correct answer is C  This question involves Standard I C  Misrepresentation   Statement I is a factual statement that discloses to clients and prospects accurate  information about the terms of the investment instrument  Statement II which guarantees  a specific rate of return for a mutual fund is an opinion stated as a fact and therefore  violates Standard I C   If statement II were rephrased to include a qualifying statement  such as  in my opinion investors may earn         it would not be in violation of the  Standards 
5,253,    The correct answer is A  This question involves three of the Standards  Anderb the  portfolio manager has been obtaining more favorable prices for her personal securities  transactions than she gets for her clients which is a breach of Standard III A  Loyalty  Prudence and Care  In addition she violated Standard I D  Misconduct by failing to  adhere to company policy and by hiding her personal transactions from her firm   Anderb s supervisor Bates violated Standard IV C  Responsibilities of Supervisors   although the company had requirements for reporting personal trading Bates failed to  adequately enforce those requirements  Answer B does not represent a violation because  Standard VI B  Priority of Transactions requires that personal trading in a security be  conducted after the trading in that security of clients and the employer  The Code and  Standards do not prohibit owning such investments although firms may establish policies  that limit the investment opportunities of members and candidates  Answer C does not  represent a violation because the Code and Standards do not contain a prohibition against  employees using the same broker for their personal accounts that they use for their client  accounts  This arrangement should be disclosed to the employer so that the employer may  determine whether a conflict of interest exists

2,254,    The correct answer is A because this question relates to Standard I A  Knowledge of the  Law specifically global application of the Code and Standards  Members and  candidates who practice in multiple jurisdictions may be subject to various securities laws  and regulations  If applicable law is more strict than the requirements of the Code and  Standards members and candidates must adhere to applicable law  otherwise members  and candidates must adhere to the Code and Standards  Therefore answer A is correct   Answer B is incorrect because members and candidates must adhere to the higher  standard set by the Code and Standards if local applicable law is less strict  Answer C is  incorrect because when no applicable law exists members and candidates are required to  adhere to the Code and Standards and the Code and Standards prohibit the use of  material nonpublic information 
3,254,    The correct answer is B  The best course of action under Standard I B  Independence and  Objectivity is to avoid a conflict of interest whenever possible  Therefore for Ward to  pay for all his expenses is the correct answer  Answer C details a course of action in  which the conflict would be disclosed but the solution is not as appropriate as avoiding  the conflict of interest  Answer A would not be the best course because it would not  remove the appearance of a conflict of interest  even though the report would not be  affected by the reimbursement of expenses it could appear to be 
4,254,    The correct answer is B  Under Standard IV A  Loyalty members and candidates may  undertake independent practice that may result in compensation or other benefit in  competition with their employer as long as they obtain consent from their employer   Answer C is not consistent with the Standards because the Standards allow members and  candidates to make arrangements or preparations to go into competitive business as long  as those arrangements do not interfere with their duty to their current employer  Answer  A is not consistent with the Standards because the Standards do not include a complete  prohibition against undertaking independent practice 
5,254,    The correct answer is B  This question involves Standard VI A  Disclosure of  Conflicts specifically the holdings of an analyst s employer in company stock   Answers A and C do not describe conflicts of interest that Smith would have to disclose   Answer A describes the use of a firm s products which would not be a required  disclosure  In answer C the relationship between the analyst and the company through a  relative is so tangential that it does not create a conflict of interest necessitating  disclosure 
6,254,    The correct answer is C  This question relates to Standard I C  Misrepresentation   Although Michelieu s statement about the total return of his clients  accounts on average  may be technically true it is misleading because the majority of the gain resulted from  one client s large position taken against Michelieu s advice  Therefore this statement  misrepresents the investment performance the member is responsible for  He has not  taken steps to present a fair accurate and complete presentation of performance  Answer  B is thus incorrect  Answer A is incorrect because although Michelieu is not guaranteeing  future results his words are still a misrepresentation of his performance history

2,255,    The correct answer is B  The best policy to prevent violation of Standard II A  Material  Nonpublic Information is the establishment of firewalls in a firm to prevent exchange of  insider information  The physical and informational barrier of a firewall between the  investment banking department and the brokerage operation prevents the investment  banking department from providing information to analysts on the brokerage side who  may be writing recommendations on a company stock  Prohibiting recommendations of  the stock of companies that are clients of the investment banking department is an  alternative but answer A states that this prohibition would be permanent which is not the  best answer  Once an offering is complete and the material nonpublic information  obtained by the investment banking department becomes public resuming publishing  recommendations on the stock is not a violation of the Code and Standards because the  information of the investment banking department no longer gives the brokerage  operation an advantage in writing the report  Answer C is incorrect because no exchange  of information should be occurring between the investment banking department and the  brokerage operation so monitoring of such exchanges is not an effective compliance  procedure for preventing the use of material nonpublic information 
3,255,    The correct answer is B  Under Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and Care members  and candidates who manage a company s pension fund owe these duties to the  participants and beneficiaries of the pension plan not the management of the company or  the company s shareholders 
4,255,    The correct answer is B  Answer B gives one of the two primary reasons listed in the  Handbook for disclosing referral fees to clients under Standard VI C  Referral Fees   The  other is to allow clients and employers to evaluate the full cost of the services   Answer A is incorrect because Standard VI C  does not require members or candidates to discount  their fees when they receive referral fees  Answer C is inconsistent with Standard VI C   because disclosure of referral fees to be effective should be made to prospective clients  before entering into a formal client relationship with them 
5,255,    The correct answer is B  Standard VI B  Priority of Transactions does not limit  transactions of company employees that differ from current recommendations as long as  the sale does not disadvantage current clients  Thus answer A is incorrect  Answer C is  incorrect because the Standard does not require the matching of personal and client  trades 
6,255,    Answer C is correct  Standard IV A  Loyalty discusses activities permissible to members  and candidates when they are leaving their current employer  soliciting clients is strictly  prohibited  Thus answer A is inconsistent with the Code and Standards even with the  required disclosure  Answer B is incorrect because the offer does not directly violate the  Code and Standards  There may be out of work members and candidates who can arrange  the necessary commitments without violating the Code and Standards 
7,255,    Answer A is correct  The question relates to Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and  Care  Carter believes the broker offers effective execution at a fee that is comparable with  those of other brokers so he is free to use the broker for all accounts  Answer B is  incorrect because the accounts that prohibit soft dollar arrangements do not want to fund  the purchase of research by Carter  The new trading scheme does not incur additional  commissions from clients so it would not go against the prohibitions  Answer C is  incorrect because Carter should not incur unnecessary or excessive  churning  of the  portfolios  excessive trading  for the purpose of meeting the brokerage commitments of  soft dollar arrangements

2,256,    Answer B is correct according to Standard VII B  Reference to CFA Institute the CFA  Designation and the CFA Program  CFA Program candidates do not receive their actual  scores on the exam  Topic and subtopic results are grouped into three broad categories  and the exam is graded only as  pass  or  fail   Although a candidate may have achieved  a topical score of  above      she or he cannot factually state that she or he received the  highest possible score because that information is not reported  Thus answer C is  incorrect  Answer A is incorrect as long as the member or candidate actually completed  the exams consecutively  Standard VII B  does not prohibit the communication of factual  information about completing the CFA Program in three consecutive years 
3,256,    Answer C is correct  According to Standard III A  Loyalty Prudence and Care the CFA  Program would be considered a personal or firm expense and should not be paid for with  the fund s brokerage commissions  Soft dollar accounts should be used only to purchase  research services that directly assist the investment manager in the investment decision  making process not to assist the management of the firm or to further education  Thus  answer A is incorrect  Answer B is incorrect because the reasonableness of how the  money is used is not an issue  the issue is that educational expense is not research 
4,256,    Answer A is correct  Standard I B  Independence and Objectivity emphasizes the need  for members and candidates to maintain their independence and objectivity  Best  practices dictate that firms adopt a strict policy not to accept compensation for travel  arrangements  At times however accepting paid travel would not compromise one s  independence and objectivity  Answers B and C are incorrect because the added  benefits free conference admission for additional staff members and an exclusive golf  retreat for the speaker could be viewed as inducements related to the firm s working  arrangements and not solely related to the speaking engagement  Should Long wish to  bring other team members or participate in the golf outing he or his firm should be  responsible for the associated fees 
5,256,    Answer C is correct  The guidance to Standard II A  Material Nonpublic Information  recommends adding securities to the firm s restricted list when the firm has or may have  material nonpublic information  By adding these securities to this list Andrews would  uphold this standard  Because waiting until the next day will not ensure that news of the  merger is made public answer A is incorrect  Negotiations may take much longer  between the two companies and the merger may never happen  Andrews must wait until  the information is disseminated to the market before he trades on that information   Answer B is incorrect because Andrews should not disclose the information to other  managers  no trading is allowed on material nonpublic information 
6,256,    Answer B is correct  Through placing a personal purchase order that is significantly  greater than the average volume Pietro is violating Standard IIB Market Manipulation   He is attempting to manipulate an increase in the share price and thus bring a buyer to the  negotiating table  The news of a possible merger and confirmation of the firm s earnings  guidance may also have positive effects on the price of Local Bank but Pietro s actions  in instructing the release of the information does not represent a violation through market  manipulation  Announcements of this nature are common and practical to keep investors  informed  Thus answers A and C are incorrect

2,257,    Answer C is correct  Cupp violated Standard III D  Performance Presentations when he  deviated from the firm s stated policies solely to capture the gain from the holding being  acquired  Answer A is incorrect because the firm does not claim GIPS compliance and  the GIPS standards require external cash flows to be treated in a consistent manner with  the firm s documented policies  Answer B is incorrect because the firm does not state that  it is updating its composite policies  If such a change were to occur all cash flows for the  month would have to be reviewed to ensure their consistent treatment under the new  policy 
3,257,    Answer A is correct  According to Standard V C  Record Retention Cannan needed the  permission of her employer to maintain the files at home after her employment ended   Without that permission she should have deleted the files  All files created as part of a  member s or candidate s professional activity are the property of the firm even those  created outside normal work hours  Thus answer B is incorrect  Answer C is incorrect  because the Code and Standards do not prohibit using one s personal computer to  complete work for one s employer 
4,257,    Answer B is correct  According to Standard VII B  Reference to CFA Institute the CFA  Designation and the CFA Program Quinn cannot claim to have finished the CFA  Program or be eligible for the CFA charter until he officially learns that he has passed the  Level III exam  Until the results for the most recent exam are released those who sat for  the exam should continue to refer to themselves as  candidates   Thus answer C is  incorrect  Answer A is incorrect because members and candidates may discuss areas of  practice in which they believe the CFA Program improved their personal skills 
5,257,    Answer A is correct  Hart s decision to invest in the retail fund appears directly correlated  with Rodriguez s statement about the successful quarter of Mega Retail and thus violates  Standard II A  Material Nonpublic Information  Rodriguez s information would be  considered material because it would influence the share price of Mega Retail and  probably influence the price of the entire exchange traded retail fund  Thus answer B is  incorrect  Answer C is also incorrect because Rodriguez shared information that was both  material and nonpublic  Company officers regularly have such knowledge about their  firms which is not a violation  The sharing of such information however even in a  conversation between friends does violate Standard II A  
6,257,    Answer C is correct  Standard VII A  Conduct as Members and Candidates in the CFA  Program prohibits providing information to candidates or the public that is considered  confidential to the CFA Program  In revealing that questions related to the analysis of  inventories and analysis of taxes were on the exam Park has violated this standard   Answer B is incorrect because the guidance for the standard explicitly acknowledges that  members and candidates are allowed to offer their opinions about the CFA Program   Answer A is incorrect because candidates are not prohibited from using outside  resources 
7,257,    Answer B is correct  Paper has violated Standard III D  Performance Presentation by not  disclosing that he was part of a team of managers that achieved the results shown  If he  had also included the return of the portion he directly managed he would not have  violated the standard  Thus answer A is incorrect  Answer C is incorrect because Paper  received written permission from his prior employer to include the results

6,259,LEARNING OUTCOMES
7,259,The candidate should be able to 
8,259,a  explain why the GIPS standards were created what parties the GIPS standards apply to  and who is served by the standards 
9,259,b  explain the construction and purpose of composites in performance reporting 
10,259,c  explain the requirements for verification 
11,259,The objective of this reading is to orient the Level I candidate approaching the assigned sections  of the GIPS standards  It explains why the GIPS standards were created who can claim  compliance and who benefits from compliance  It also introduces the key notion of composites  states the purpose of verification and previews the structure of the Standards 
12,259,I  WHY WERE THE GIPS STANDARDS  CREATED 
13,259,Institutions and individuals are constantly scrutinizing past investment performance returns in  search of the best manager to achieve their investment objectives 
14,259,In the past the investment community had great difficulty making meaningful comparisons on  the basis of accurate investment performance data  Several performance measurement practices  hindered the comparability of performance returns from one firm to another while others called  into question the accuracy and credibility of performance reporting overall  Misleading  practices included 
15,259,  Representative Accounts  Selecting a top performing portfolio to represent the firm s  overall investment results for a specific mandate

2,260,  Survivorship Bias  Presenting an  average  performance history that excludes portfolios  whose poor performance was weak enough to result in termination of the firm 
3,260,  Varying Time Periods  Presenting performance for a selected time period during which  the mandate produced excellent returns or out performed its benchmark making  comparison with other firms  results difficult or impossible 
4,260,Making a valid comparison of investment performance among even the most ethical investment  management firms was problematic  For example a pension fund seeking to hire an investment  management firm might receive proposals from several firms all using different methodologies  for calculating their results 
5,260,The GIPS standards are a practitioner driven set of ethical principles that establish a  standardized industry wide approach for investment firms to follow in calculating and  presenting their historical investment results to prospective clients  The GIPS standards ensure  fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance  In other words the GIPS  standards lead investment management firms to avoid misrepresentations of performance and to  communicate all relevant information that prospective clients should know in order to evaluate  past results 
6,260,II  WHO CAN CLAIM COMPLIANCE 
7,260,First any investment management firm may choose to comply with the GIPS standards   Complying with the GIPS standards is voluntary  Compliance with the GIPS standards is not  typically required by legal or regulatory authorities 
8,260,Second only investment management firms that actually manage assets can claim compliance  with the Standards  Plan sponsors and consultants cannot make a claim of compliance unless  they actually manage assets for which they are making a claim of compliance  They can claim  to endorse the Standards and or require that their investment managers comply with the  Standards  Similarly software  and the vendors who supply software  cannot be  compliant    Software can assist firms in achieving compliance with the GIPS standards  e g  by calculating  performance in a manner consistent with the calculation requirements of the Standards  but only  an investment management firm can claim compliance once the firm has satisfied all  requirements of the Standards 
9,260,Third compliance is a firm wide process that cannot be achieved on a single product or  composite  A firm has only two options with regard to compliance with the GIPS standards   fully comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards and claim compliance through the use  of the GIPS Compliance Statement  or not comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards  and not claim compliance with or make any reference to the GIPS standards

2,261,III  WHO BENEFITS FROM COMPLIANCE 
3,261,The GIPS standards benefit two main groups  investment management firms and prospective  clients 
4,261,  By choosing to comply with the GIPS standards investment management firms assure  prospective clients that the historical  track record  they report is both complete and  fairly presented  Compliance enables the GIPS compliant firm to participate in  competitive bids against other compliant firms throughout the world  Achieving and  maintaining compliance may also strengthen the firm s internal controls over  performance related processes and procedures 
5,261,  Investors have a greater level of confidence in the integrity of performance presentations  of a GIPS compliant firm and can more easily compare performance presentations from  different investment management firms  While the GIPS standards certainly do not  eliminate the need for in depth due diligence on the part of the investor compliance with  the Standards enhances the credibility of investment management firms that have chosen  to undertake this responsibility 
6,261,IV  COMPOSITES
7,261,One of the key concepts of the Standards is the required use of composites  A composite is an  aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate  objective or strategy  A composite must include all actual fee paying discretionary portfolios  managed in accordance with the same investment mandate objective or strategy  For example  if a GIPS compliant firm presents its track record for a Global Equity Composite  the  Composite  the Composite must include all portfolios that are managed or have historically  been managed in the firm s Global Equity strategy  The firm may not subjectively select which  Global Equity portfolios will be included in or excluded from the calculation and presentation  of the Global Equity Composite  The determination of which portfolios to include in the  Composite should be done according to pre established criteria  i e  on an ex ante basis  not  after the fact  This prevents a firm from including only their best performing portfolios in the  Composite

2,262,V  VERIFICATION
3,262,Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards are responsible for their claim of  compliance and for maintaining that compliance  That is firms self regulate their claim of  compliance  Once a firm claims compliance with the Standards they may voluntarily hire an  independent third party to perform a verification in order to increase confidence in the firm s  claim of compliance  Verification may also increase the knowledge of the firm s performance  measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the firm s compliant  presentations 
4,262,Verification is performed with respect to an entire firm not on specific composites  Verification  does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation  Verification tests 
5,262,  whether the investment firm has complied with all the composite construction  requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm wide basis and
6,262,  whether the firm s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present  performance in compliance with the GIPS standards 
7,262,Verification must be performed by an independent third party  A firm cannot perform its own  verification 
8,262,Third party verification brings additional credibility to a firm s claim of compliance  A verified  firm may provide existing and prospective clients with greater assurance about its claim of  compliance with the GIPS standards  Verification may also provide improved internal processes  and procedures as well as marketing advantages to the firm 
9,262,VI  THE STRUCTURE OF THE GIPS STANDARDS
10,262,The provisions within the      edition of the GIPS standards are divided into nine sections   Fundamentals of Compliance Input Data Calculation Methodology Composite Construction  Disclosure Presentation and Reporting Real Estate Private Equity and Wrap Fee Separately  Managed Account  SMA  Portfolios  The provisions are further categorized into requirements  and recommendations

15,263,History

2,264,In      the proposed GIPS standards were posted on the CFA Institute website and circulated for comment  to more than      individuals who had expressed interest  The result was the first Global Investment  Performance Standards published in April      
3,264,The initial edition of the GIPS standards was designed to create a minimum global investment performance  standard that would

5,264,  Give the global investment management industry one commonly accepted approach for calculating  and presenting performance  and
6,264,  Address liquid asset classes  equity fixed income and cash  
7,264,In      the Global Investment Performance Standards Committee was replaced by the Investment  Performance Council  IPC  to further develop and promote the GIPS standards  The development of the  GIPS standards was a global industry initiative with participation from individuals and organizations from  more than    countries 
8,264,The IPC was charged with developing provisions for other asset classes  e g  real estate private equity  and  addressing other performance related issues  e g  fees advertising  to broaden the scope and applicability of  the GIPS standards  This was accomplished when the second edition of the GIPS standards was published in  February      
9,264,With the release of the      edition of the GIPS standards and growing adoption and expansion of the GIPS  standards the IPC decided to move to a single global investment performance standard and eliminate the  need for local variations of the GIPS standards  All country specific performance standards converged with  the GIPS standards resulting in    countries adopting a single global standard for the calculation and  presentation of investment performance 
10,264,In      with the convergence of country specific versions to the GIPS standards and the need to reorganize  the governance structure to facilitate involvement from GIPS sponsors CFA Institute dissolved the IPC and  created the GIPS Executive Committee and the GIPS Council  The GIPS Executive Committee serves as the  decision making authority for the GIPS standards and the GIPS Council facilitates the involvement of all  sponsors in the ongoing development and promotion of the GIPS standards 
11,264,To maintain global relevance and in recognition of the dynamic nature of the investment industry the GIPS  standards must be continually updated through interpretations guidance and new provisions  In      the  GIPS Executive Committee began its review of the GIPS standards in an effort to further refine the  provisions as well as eliminate provisions that are no longer necessary and add new requirements and  recommendations that promote best practice  The GIPS Executive Committee worked in close collaboration  with its technical subcommittees specially formed working groups and GIPS sponsors  These groups  reviewed the existing provisions and guidance and conducted surveys and other research as part of the  efforts to produce the      edition of the GIPS standards

2,265,Standardized Investment Performance
3,265,Financial markets and the investment management industry have become increasingly global in nature  The  growth in the types and number of financial entities the globalization of the investment process and the  increased competition among investment management firms demonstrate the need to standardize the  calculation and presentation of investment performance 
4,265,Global Passport
5,265,Asset managers and both existing and prospective clients benefit from an established global standard for  calculating and presenting investment performance  Investment practices regulation performance  measurement and reporting of performance vary considerably from country to country  By adhering to a  global standard firms in countries with minimal or no investment performance standards will be able to  compete for business on an equal footing with firms from countries with more developed standards  Firms  from countries with established practices will have more confidence in being fairly compared with local  firms when competing for business in countries that have not previously adopted performance standards   Performance standards that are accepted globally enable investment firms to measure and present their  investment performance so that investors can readily compare investment performance among firms 
6,265,Investor Confidence
7,265,Investment managers that adhere to investment performance standards help assure investors that the firm s  investment performance is complete and fairly presented  Both prospective and existing clients of  investment firms benefit from a global investment performance standard by having a greater degree of  confidence in the performance information presented to them 
8,265,Objectives
9,265,The establishment of a voluntary global investment performance standard leads to an accepted set of best  practices for calculating and presenting investment performance that is readily comparable among  investment firms regardless of geographic location  These standards also facilitate a dialogue between  investment firms and their existing and prospective clients regarding investment performance 
10,265,The goals of the GIPS Executive Committee are 
11,265,  To establish investment industry best practices for calculating and presenting investment performance  that promote investor interests and instill investor confidence 
12,265,  To obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for the calculation and presentation of  investment performance based on the principles of fair representation and full disclosure 
13,265,  To promote the use of accurate and consistent investment performance data 
14,265,  To encourage fair global competition among investment firms without creating barriers to entry  and
15,265,  To foster the notion of industry  self regulation  on a global basis 
16,265,Overview
17,265,Key features of the GIPS standards include the following 
18,265,  The GIPS standards are ethical standards for investment performance presentation to ensure fair  representation and full disclosure of investment performance  In order to claim compliance firms  must adhere to the requirements included in the GIPS standards 
19,265,http   e pub sooo  twbcxkths omlr vbk OEBPS CFA     R     print            x

1,266,    yang lu  yolandalulu outlook com                                                 
2,266,  Meeting the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure is likely to require more than simply  adhering to the minimum requirements of the GIPS standards  Firms should also adhere to the  recommendations to achieve best practice in the calculation and presentation of performance 
3,266,  The GIPS standards require firms to include all actual discretionary fee paying portfolios in at least  one composite defined by investment mandate objective or strategy in order to prevent firms from  cherry picking their best performance 
4,266,  The GIPS standards rely on the integrity of input data  The accuracy of input data is critical to the  accuracy of the performance presentation  The underlying valuations of portfolio holdings drive the  portfolio s performance  It is essential for these and other inputs to be accurate  The GIPS standards  require firms to adhere to certain calculation methodologies and to make specific disclosures along  with the firm s performance 
5,266,  Firms must comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards including any updates Guidance  Statements interpretations Questions   Answers  Q As  and clarifications published by CFA  Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee which are available on the GIPS website   www gipsstandards org  as well as in the GIPS Handbook 
6,266,The GIPS standards do not address every aspect of performance measurement or cover unique  characteristics of each asset class  The GIPS standards will continue to evolve over time to address  additional areas of investment performance  Understanding and interpreting investment performance  requires consideration of both risk and return  Historically the GIPS standards focused primarily on returns   In the spirit of fair representation and full disclosure and in order to provide investors with a more  comprehensive view of a firm s performance the      edition of the GIPS standards includes new  provisions related to risk 
7,266,Historical Performance Record
8,266,  A firm is required to initially present at a minimum five years of annual investment performance that  is compliant with the GIPS standards  If the firm or the composite has been in existence less than five  years the firm must present performance since the firm s inception or the composite inception date 
9,266,  After a firm presents a minimum of five years of GIPS compliant performance  or for the period since  the firm s inception or the composite inception date if the firm or the composite has been in existence  less than five years  the firm must present an additional year of performance each year building up to  a minimum of    years of GIPS compliant performance 
10,266,  Firms may link non GIPS compliant performance to their GIPS compliant performance provided that  only GIPS compliant performance is presented for periods after   January      and the firm discloses  the periods of non compliance  Firms must not link non GIPS compliant performance for periods  beginning on or after   January      to their GIPS compliant performance  Firms that manage private  equity real estate and or wrap fee separately managed account  SMA  portfolios must also comply  with Sections     and   respectively of the Provisions of the GIPS standards that became effective  as of   January      
11,266,Compliance
12,266,Firms must take all steps necessary to ensure that they have satisfied all the requirements of the GIPS  standards before claiming compliance  Firms are strongly encouraged to perform periodic internal  compliance checks  Implementing adequate internal controls during all stages of the investment performance  process from data input to preparing performance presentations will instill confidence in the validity of  performance presented as well as in the claim of compliance

2,267,Firms may choose to have an independent third party verification that tests the construction of the firm s  composites as well as the firm s policies and procedures as they relate to compliance with the GIPS  standards  The value of verification is widely recognized and being verified is considered to be best  practice  The GIPS Executive Committee strongly recommends that firms be verified  In addition to  verification firms may also choose to have specifically focused composite testing  performance  examination  performed by an independent third party verifier to provide additional assurance regarding a  particular composite 
3,267,Effective Date
4,267,The effective date for the      edition of the GIPS standards is   January       Compliant presentations  that include performance for periods that begin on or after   January      must be prepared in accordance  with the      edition of the GIPS standards  Prior editions of the GIPS standards may be found on the GIPS  website  www gipsstandards org  
5,267,Implementing a Global Standard
6,267,The presence of a local sponsoring organization for investment performance standards is essential for  effective implementation and ongoing support of the GIPS standards within a jurisdiction  Such sponsors  also provide an important link between the GIPS Executive Committee the governing body for the GIPS  standards and the local markets in which investment managers operate 
7,267,The sponsor by actively supporting the GIPS standards and the work of the GIPS Executive Committee  ensures that the jurisdiction s interests are taken into account as the GIPS standards are developed   Compliance with the GIPS standards is voluntary and support from the local market sponsor helps to drive  the adoption of the GIPS standards 
8,267,The GIPS Executive Committee strongly encourages countries without an investment performance standard  to promote the GIPS standards as the local standard and translate them into the local language when  necessary  Although the GIPS standards may be translated into many languages if a discrepancy arises the  English version of the GIPS standards is the official governing version 
9,267,The GIPS Executive Committee will continue to promote the principles of fair representation and full  disclosure and develop the GIPS standards so that they maintain their relevance within the changing  investment management industry 
10,267,The self regulatory nature of the GIPS standards necessitates a strong commitment to ethical integrity  Self  regulation also assists regulators in exercising their responsibility for ensuring the fair disclosure of  information within financial markets  The GIPS Executive Committee encourages regulators to 
11,267,  Recognize the benefit of voluntary compliance with standards that represent global best practices 
12,267,  Give consideration to taking enforcement actions against firms that falsely claim compliance with the  GIPS standards  and
13,267,  Recognize and encourage independent third party verification 
14,267,Where existing laws regulations or industry standards already impose requirements related to the  calculation and presentation of investment performance firms are strongly encouraged to comply with the  GIPS standards in addition to applicable regulatory requirements  Compliance with applicable law and or  regulation does not necessarily lead to compliance with the GIPS standards  In cases in which laws and or  regulations conflict with the GIPS standards firms are required to comply with the laws and regulations and  make full disclosure of the conflict in the compliant presentation

6,269,I  PROVISIONS OF THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
7,269,The provisions within the GIPS standards are divided into the following nine sections  Fundamentals of  Compliance Input Data Calculation Methodology Composite Construction Disclosure Presentation and  Reporting Real Estate Private Equity and Wrap Fee Separately Managed Account  SMA  Portfolios 
8,269,The provisions for each section are categorized into requirements and recommendations  Firms must meet  all the requirements to claim compliance with the GIPS standards  Firms are encouraged to implement as  many of the recommendations as possible  These recommended provisions are considered to be industry  best practice and assist firms in fully adhering to the spirit and intent of the GIPS standards 
9,269,   Fundamentals of Compliance  Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards  including properly defining the firm providing compliant presentations to all prospective clients  adhering to applicable laws and regulations and ensuring that information presented is not false or  misleading  Two important issues that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS  standards are the definition of the firm and the firm s definition of discretion  The definition of the  firm is the foundation for firm wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm  assets can be determined  The firm s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which  portfolios must be included in a composite and is based on the firm s ability to implement its  investment strategy 
10,269,   Input Data  Consistency of input data used to calculate performance is critical to effective  compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the foundation for full fair and comparable  investment performance presentations  For periods beginning on or after   January      all portfolios  must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles 
11,269,   Calculation Methodology  Achieving comparability among investment management firms   performance presentations requires uniformity in methods used to calculate returns  The GIPS  standards mandate the use of certain calculation methodologies to facilitate comparability 
12,269,   Composite Construction  A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed  according to a similar investment mandate objective or strategy  The composite return is the asset  weighted average of the performance of all portfolios in the composite  Creating meaningful  composites is essential to the fair presentation consistency and comparability of performance over  time and among firms

2,270,   Disclosure  Disclosures allow firms to elaborate on the data provided in the presentation and give the  reader the proper context in which to understand the performance  To comply with the GIPS  standards firms must disclose certain information in all compliant presentations regarding their  performance and the policies adopted by the firm  Although some disclosures are required for all  firms others are specific to certain circumstances and may not be applicable in all situations  One of  the essential disclosures for every firm is the claim of compliance  Once a firm meets all the  requirements of the GIPS standards it must appropriately use the claim of compliance to indicate  compliance with the GIPS standards  The      edition of the GIPS standards includes a revised  compliance statement that indicates if the firm has or has not been verified 
3,270,   Presentation and Reporting  After constructing the composites gathering the input data calculating  returns and determining the necessary disclosures the firm must incorporate this information in  presentations based on the requirements in the GIPS standards for presenting investment performance   No finite set of requirements can cover all potential situations or anticipate future developments in  investment industry structure technology products or practices  When appropriate firms have the  responsibility to include in GIPS compliant presentations information not addressed by the GIPS  standards 
4,270,   Real Estate  Unless otherwise noted this section supplements all of the required and recommended  provisions in Sections      Real estate provisions were first included in the      edition of the GIPS  standards and became effective   January       The      edition of the GIPS standards includes new  provisions for closed end real estate funds  Firms should note that certain provisions of Sections      do not apply to real estate investments or are superseded by provisions within Section    The  provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section   
5,270,   Private Equity  Unless otherwise noted this section supplements all of the required and  recommended provisions in Sections      Private equity provisions were first included in the       edition of the GIPS standards and became effective   January       Firms should note that certain  provisions in Sections     do not apply to private equity investments or are superseded by provisions  within Section    The provisions that do not apply have been noted within Section   
6,270,   Wrap Fee Separately Managed Account  SMA  Portfolios  Unless otherwise noted this section  supplements all of the required and recommended provisions in Sections      Firms should note that  certain provisions in Sections     of the GIPS standards do not apply to wrap fee SMA portfolios or  are superseded by provisions within Section    The provisions that do not apply have been noted  within Section

4,297,IV  VERIFICATION
5,297,VERIFICATION is intended to provide a FIRM and its existing clients and PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS additional  confidence in the FIRM S claim of compliance with the GIPS standards  VERIFICATION may increase the  knowledge of the FIRM S performance measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the  FIRM S COMPLIANT PRESENTATIONS  VERIFICATION may also provide improved internal processes and  procedures as well as marketing advantages to the FIRM  Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any  specific COMPOSITE presentation 
6,297,The GIPS standards RECOMMEND that FIRMS be verified  VERIFICATION brings additional credibility to the  claim of compliance and supports the overall guiding principles of fair representation and full disclosure of a  FIRM S investment performance 
7,297,The VERIFICATION procedures attempt to strike a balance between ensuring the quality accuracy and  relevance of performance presentations and minimizing the cost to FIRMS 
8,297,Scope and Purpose of Verification
9,297,   VERIFICATION MUST be performed by a qualified independent third party 
10,297,   VERIFICATION assesses whether 
11,297,a  The FIRM has complied with all the COMPOSITE construction REQUIREMENTS of the GIPS  standards on a FIRM wide basis and
12,297,b  The FIRM S policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in  compliance with the GIPS standards 
13,297,   A single VERIFICATION REPORT is issued with respect to the whole FIRM  VERIFICATION cannot be  carried out on a COMPOSITE and accordingly does not provide assurance about the performance of  any specific COMPOSITE  FIRMS MUST NOT state that a particular COMPOSITE has been  verified  or  make any claim to that effect 
14,297,   The initial minimum period for which VERIFICATION can be performed is one year  or from FIRM inception date through period end if less than one year  of a FIRM S presented performance  The  RECOMMENDED period over which VERIFICATION is performed is that part of the FIRM S performance  for which compliance with the GIPS standards is claimed 
15,297,   A VERIFICATION REPORT MUST opine that 
16,297,a  The FIRM has complied with all the COMPOSITE construction REQUIREMENTS of the GIPS  standards on a FIRM wide basis and

2,298,The FIRM MUST NOT state that it has been verified unless a VERIFICATION REPORT has been issued 
3,298,   A principal verifier may accept the work of another verifier as part of the basis for the principal  verifier s opinion  A principal verifier may also choose to rely on the audit and or internal control  work of a qualified and reputable independent third party  In addition a principal verifier may choose  to rely on the other audit and or internal control work performed by the VERIFICATION firm  If  reliance on another party s work is planned the scope of work including time period covered results  of procedures performed qualifications competency objectivity and reputation of the other party  MUST be assessed by the principal verifier when making the determination as to whether to place any  reliance on such work  Reliance considerations and conclusions MUST be documented by the principal  verifier  The principal verifier MUST use professional skepticism when deciding whether to place  reliance on work performed by another independent third party 
4,298,   Sample PORTFOLIO Selection  Verifiers MUST subject the entire FIRM to testing when performing  VERIFICATION procedures unless reliance is placed on work performed by a qualified and reputable  independent third party or appropriate alternative control procedures have been performed by the  verifier  Verifiers may use a sampling methodology when performing such procedures  Verifiers  MUST consider the following criteria when selecting samples 
5,298,a  Number of COMPOSITES at the FIRM 
6,298,b  Number of PORTFOLIOS in each COMPOSITE 
7,298,c  Type of COMPOSITE 
8,298,d  TOTAL FIRM ASSETS

10,298,f  Number of years being verified  and
11,298,g  Computer applications software used in the construction and maintenance of COMPOSITES the  use of external performance measurers and the method of calculating performance 
12,298,This list is not all inclusive and contains only the minimum criteria that MUST be considered in the  selection and evaluation of a sample  For example one potentially useful approach would be to  include in the sample a PORTFOLIO that has the largest impact on COMPOSITE performance because of  its size or because of extremely good or bad performance  Missing or incomplete documents or the  presence of errors would normally be expected to warrant selecting a larger sample or applying  additional VERIFICATION procedures 
13,298,   After performing the VERIFICATION the verifier may conclude that the FIRM is not in compliance with  the GIPS standards or that the records of the FIRM cannot support a VERIFICATION  In such situations  the verifier MUST issue a statement to the FIRM clarifying why a VERIFICATION REPORT could not be  issued  A VERIFICATION REPORT MUST NOT be issued when the verifier knows that the FIRM is not in  compliance with the GIPS standards or the records of the FIRM cannot support a VERIFICATION 
14,298,   The minimum VERIFICATION procedures are described below in Section B  The VERIFICATION REPORT MUST state that the VERIFICATION has been conducted in accordance with these  VERIFICATION procedures 
15,298,Required Verification Procedures
16,298,The following are the minimum procedures that verifiers MUST follow when conducting a VERIFICATION   Verifiers MUST complete the VERIFICATION in accordance with these procedures prior to issuing a

2,337,   INTRODUCTION
3,337,As individuals we often face decisions that involve saving money for a future use or  borrowing money for current consumption  We then need to determine the amount we need to  invest if we are saving or the cost of borrowing if we are shopping for a loan  As investment  analysts much of our work also involves evaluating transactions with present and future cash  flows  When we place a value on any security for example we are attempting to determine the  worth of a stream of future cash flows  To carry out all the above tasks accurately we must  understand the mathematics of time value of money problems  Money has time value in that  individuals value a given amount of money more highly the earlier it is received  Therefore a  smaller amount of money now may be equivalent in value to a larger amount received at a  future date  The time value of money as a topic in investment mathematics deals with  equivalence relationships between cash flows with different dates  Mastery of time value of  money concepts and techniques is essential for investment analysts 
4,337,The reading  is organized as follows  Section   introduces some terminology used throughout  the reading and supplies some economic intuition for the variables we will discuss  Section    tackles the problem of determining the worth at a future point in time of an amount invested  today  Section   addresses the future worth of a series of cash flows  These two sections provide  the tools for calculating the equivalent value at a future date of a single cash flow or series of  cash flows  Sections   and   discuss the equivalent value today of a single future cash flow and  a series of future cash flows respectively  In Section   we explore how to determine other  quantities of interest in time value of money problems 
5,337,   INTEREST RATES  INTERPRETATION
6,337,In this reading we will continually refer to interest rates  In some cases we assume a particular  value for the interest rate  in other cases the interest rate will be the unknown quantity we seek  to determine  Before turning to the mechanics of time value of money problems we must  illustrate the underlying economic concepts  In this section we briefly explain the meaning and  interpretation of interest rates 
7,337,Time value of money concerns equivalence relationships between cash flows occurring on  different dates  The idea of equivalence relationships is relatively simple  Consider the  following exchange  You pay        today and in return receive       today  Would you  accept this arrangement  Not likely  But what if you received the       today and paid the         one year from now  Can these amounts be considered equivalent  Possibly because a  payment of        a year from now would probably be worth less to you than a payment of         today  It would be fair therefore to discount the        received in one year  that is  to cut its value based on how much time passes before the money is paid  An interest rate  denoted r is a rate of return that reflects the relationship between differently dated cash flows   If       today and        in one year are equivalent in value then                        is the required compensation for receiving        in one year rather than now  The interest  rate the required compensation stated as a rate of return is                     or       percent

2,338,Interest rates can be thought of in three ways  First they can be considered required rates of  return that is the minimum rate of return an investor must receive in order to accept the  investment  Second interest rates can be considered discount rates  In the example above       percent is that rate at which we discounted the        future amount to find its value today   Thus we use the terms  interest rate  and  discount rate  almost interchangeably  Third  interest rates can be considered opportunity costs  An opportunity cost is the value that  investors forgo by choosing a particular course of action  In the example if the party who  supplied       had instead decided to spend it today he would have forgone earning       percent on the money  So we can view      percent as the opportunity cost of current  consumption 
3,338,Economics tells us that interest rates are set in the marketplace by the forces of supply and  demand where investors are suppliers of funds and borrowers are demanders of funds  Taking  the perspective of investors in analyzing market determined interest rates we can view an  interest rate r as being composed of a real risk free interest rate plus a set of four premiums that  are required returns or compensation for bearing distinct types of risk 
4,338,r   Real risk free interest rate   Inflation premium   Default risk premium    Liquidity premium   Maturity premium
5,338,  The real risk free interest rate is the single period interest rate for a completely risk  free security if no inflation were expected  In economic theory the real risk free rate  reflects the time preferences of individuals for current versus future real consumption 
6,338,  The inflation premium compensates investors for expected inflation and reflects the  average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt  Inflation reduces the  purchasing power of a unit of currency the amount of goods and services one can buy  with it  The sum of the real risk free interest rate and the inflation premium is the  nominal risk free interest rate   Many countries have governmental short term debt  whose interest rate can be considered to represent the nominal risk free interest rate in  that country  The interest rate on a    day US Treasury bill  T bill  for example  represents the nominal risk free interest rate over that time horizon   US T bills can be  bought and sold in large quantities with minimal transaction costs and are backed by the  full faith and credit of the US government 
7,338,  The default risk premium compensates investors for the possibility that the borrower  will fail to make a promised payment at the contracted time and in the contracted amount 
8,338,  The liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of loss relative to an  investment s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash quickly  US  T bills for example do not bear a liquidity premium because large amounts can be  bought and sold without affecting their market price  Many bonds of small issuers by  contrast trade infrequently after they are issued  the interest rate on such bonds includes a  liquidity premium reflecting the relatively high costs  including the impact on price  of  selling a position 
9,338,  The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market  value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended in general   holding all else equal   The difference between the interest rate on longer maturity  liquid Treasury debt and that on short term Treasury debt reflects a positive maturity  premium for the longer term debt  and possibly different inflation premiums as well

2,339,Using this insight into the economic meaning of interest rates we now turn to a discussion of  solving time value of money problems starting with the future value of a single cash flow 
3,339,   THE FUTURE VALUE OF A SINGLE CASH  FLOW
4,339,In this section we introduce time value associated with a single cash flow or lump sum  investment  We describe the relationship between an initial investment or present value  PV   which earns a rate of return  the interest rate per period  denoted as r and its future value   FV  which will be received N years or periods from today 
5,339,The following example illustrates this concept  Suppose you invest       PV         in an  interest bearing bank account paying   percent annually  At the end of the first year you will  have the      plus the interest earned                  for a total of       To formalize this  one period example we define the following terms 
6,339,PV   present value of the investment
7,339,FVN   future value of the investment N periods from today
8,339,r   rate of interest per period
9,339,For N     the expression for the future value of amount PV is
10,339,Equation    
11,339,FV    PV     r 
12,339,For this example we calculate the future value one year from today as FV                       
13,339,Now suppose you decide to invest the initial      for two years with interest earned and  credited to your account annually  annual compounding   At the end of the first year  the  beginning of the second year  your account will have      which you will leave in the bank  for another year  Thus with a beginning amount of       PV         the amount at the end of  the second year will be                       Note that the       interest earned during the  second year is   percent of the amount invested at the beginning of Year   
14,339,Another way to understand this example is to note that the amount invested at the beginning of  Year   is composed of the original      that you invested plus the    interest earned during the  first year  During the second year the original principal again earns interest as does the interest  that was earned during Year    You can see how the original investment grows 
15,339,Original investment Interest for the first year               Interest for the second year based on original investment

2,340,Interest for the second year based on interest earned in the first year                interest on interest     Total
3,340,    
4,340,       
5,340,The    interest that you earned each period on the      original investment is known as simple  interest  the interest rate times the principal   Principal is the amount of funds originally  invested  During the two year period you earn     of simple interest  The extra       that you  have at the end of Year   is the interest you earned on the Year   interest of    that you  reinvested 
6,340,The interest earned on interest provides the first glimpse of the phenomenon known as  compounding  Although the interest earned on the initial investment is important for a given  interest rate it is fixed in size from period to period  The compounded interest earned on  reinvested interest is a far more powerful force because for a given interest rate it grows in size  each period  The importance of compounding increases with the magnitude of the interest rate   For example      invested today would be worth about        after     years if compounded  annually at   percent but worth more than     million if compounded annually over the same  time period at a rate of    percent 
7,340,To verify the     million figure we need a general formula to handle compounding for any  number of periods  The following general formula relates the present value of an initial  investment to its future value after N periods 
8,340,Equation    
9,340,FVN   PV     r N
10,340,where r is the stated interest rate per period and N is the number of compounding periods  In the  bank example FV                               In the    percent investment example FV                                    
11,340,The most important point to remember about using the future value equation is that the stated  interest rate r and the number of compounding periods N must be compatible  Both variables  must be defined in the same time units  For example if N is stated in months then r should be  the one month interest rate unannualized 
12,340,A time line helps us to keep track of the compatibility of time units and the interest rate per time  period  In the time line we use the time index t to represent a point in time a stated number of  periods from today  Thus the present value is the amount available for investment today  indexed as t      We can now refer to a time N periods from today as t   N  The time line in  Figure   shows this relationship

2,341,Figure    The Relationship between an Initial Investment PV and Its Future  Value FV
3,341,In Figure   we have positioned the initial investment PV at t      Using Equation   we move  the present value PV forward to t   N by the factor      r N  This factor is called a future value  factor  We denote the future value on the time line as FV and position it at t   N  Suppose the  future value is to be received exactly    periods from today s date  N        The present value  PV and the future value FV are separated in time through the factor      r    
4,341,The fact that the present value and the future value are separated in time has important  consequences 
5,341,  We can add amounts of money only if they are indexed at the same point in time 
6,341,  For a given interest rate the future value increases with the number of periods 
7,341,  For a given number of periods the future value increases with the interest rate 
8,341,To better understand these concepts consider three examples that illustrate how to apply the  future value formula 
9,341,EXAMPLE  
10,341,The Future Value of a Lump Sum with Interim  Cash Reinvested at the Same Rate
11,341,You are the lucky winner of your state s lottery of    million after taxes  You invest  your winnings in a five year certificate of deposit  CD  at a local financial institution   The CD promises to pay   percent per year compounded annually  This institution also  lets you reinvest the interest at that rate for the duration of the CD  How much will you  have at the end of five years if your money remains invested at   percent for five years  with no withdrawals 
12,341,Solution 
13,341,To solve this problem compute the future value of the    million investment using the  following values in Equation

2,342,PV            r             N     FVN   PV     r N                                                      
3,342,At the end of five years you will have             if your money remains invested at    percent with no withdrawals 
4,342,In this and most examples in this reading note that the factors are reported at six decimal  places but the calculations may actually reflect greater precision  For example the reported           has been rounded up from             the calculation is actually carried out with  more than eight decimal places of precision by the calculator or spreadsheet   Our final result  reflects the higher number of decimal places carried by the calculator or spreadsheet  
5,342,EXAMPLE  
6,342,The Future Value of a Lump Sum with No  Interim Cash
7,342,An institution offers you the following terms for a contract  For an investment of           the institution promises to pay you a lump sum six years from now at an    percent annual interest rate  What future amount can you expect 
8,342,Solution 
9,342,Use the following data in Equation   to find the future value 
10,342,PV            r             N     FVN   PV     r N                                                   
11,342,You can expect to receive          six years from now 
12,342,Our third example is a more complicated future value problem that illustrates the importance of  keeping track of actual calendar time

2,343,EXAMPLE  
3,343,The Future Value of a Lump Sum
4,343,A pension fund manager estimates that his corporate sponsor will make a     million  contribution five years from now  The rate of return on plan assets has been estimated at    percent per year  The pension fund manager wants to calculate the future value of this  contribution    years from now which is the date at which the funds will be distributed  to retirees  What is that future value 
5,343,Solution 
6,343,By positioning the initial investment PV at t     we can calculate the future value of  the contribution using the following data in Equation   
7,343,PV       million r             N      FVN   PV     r N                                                          
8,343,This problem looks much like the previous two but it differs in one important respect   its timing  From the standpoint of today  t      the future amount of              is     years into the future  Although the future value is    years from its present value the  present value of     million will not be received for another five years 
9,343,Figure    The Future Value of a Lump Sum Initial Investment Not at t    
10,343,As Figure   shows we have followed the convention of indexing today as t     and  indexing subsequent times by adding   for each period  The additional contribution of      million is to be received in five years so it is indexed as t     and appears as such in  the figure  The future value of the investment in    years is then indexed at t       that  is    years following the receipt of the     million contribution at t      Time lines like  this one can be extremely useful when dealing with more complicated problems  especially those involving more than one cash flow

2,344,In a later section of this reading we will discuss how to calculate the value today of the      million to be received five years from now  For the moment we can use Equation    Suppose  the pension fund manager in Example   above were to receive             today from the  corporate sponsor  How much will that sum be worth at the end of five years  How much will it  be worth at the end of    years 
3,344,and
4,344,PV               r             N     FVN   PV     r N                                                           at the five year mark
5,344,PV               r             N      FVN   PV     r N                                                               at the    year mark
6,344,These results show that today s present value of about      million becomes     million after  five years and        million after    years 
7,344,     The Frequency of Compounding
8,344,In this section we examine investments paying interest more than once a year  For instance  many banks offer a monthly interest rate that compounds    times a year  In such an  arrangement they pay interest on interest every month  Rather than quote the periodic monthly  interest rate financial institutions often quote an annual interest rate that we refer to as the
9,344,stated annual interest rate or quoted interest rate  We denote the stated annual interest
10,344,rate by rs  For instance your bank might state that a particular CD pays   percent compounded  monthly  The stated annual interest rate equals the monthly interest rate multiplied by     In this  example the monthly interest rate is                  or      percent   This rate is strictly a  quoting convention because                        not       the term      rs  is not meant to be  a future value factor when compounding is more frequent than annual 
11,344,With more than one compounding period per year the future value formula can be expressed as
12,344,Equation

3,345,rs m
4,345,where rs is the stated annual interest rate m is the number of compounding periods per year and  N now stands for the number of years  Note the compatibility here between the interest rate  used rs m and the number of compounding periods mN  The periodic rate rs m is the stated  annual interest rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year  The number of  compounding periods mN is the number of compounding periods in one year multiplied by the  number of years  The periodic rate rs m and the number of compounding periods mN must be  compatible 
5,345,EXAMPLE  
6,345,The Future Value of a Lump Sum with  Quarterly Compounding
7,345,Continuing with the CD example suppose your bank offers you a CD with a two year  maturity a stated annual interest rate of   percent compounded quarterly and a feature  allowing reinvestment of the interest at the same interest rate  You decide to invest          What will the CD be worth at maturity 
8,345,Solution 
9,345,Compute the future value with Equation   as follows 
10,345,PV          rs             m     rs m                 N     mN             interest periods FVN   PV      mN                                                
11,345,rs m
12,345,At maturity the CD will be worth           
13,345,The future value formula in Equation   does not differ from the one in Equation    Simply  keep in mind that the interest rate to use is the rate per period and the exponent is the number of  interest or compounding periods

2,346,The Future Value of a Lump Sum with  Monthly Compounding
3,346,An Australian bank offers to pay you   percent compounded monthly  You decide to  invest A   million for one year  What is the future value of your investment if interest  payments are reinvested at   percent 
4,346,Solution 
5,346,Use Equation   to find the future value of the one year investment as follows 
6,346,PV   A         rs             m      rs m                    N     mN               interest periods FVN   PV      mN   A                    A                      A           
7,346,rs m
8,346,If you had been paid   percent with annual compounding the future amount would be  only A                 A         instead of A            with monthly  compounding 
9,346,     Continuous Compounding
10,346,The preceding discussion on compounding periods illustrates discrete compounding which  credits interest after a discrete amount of time has elapsed  If the number of compounding  periods per year becomes infinite then interest is said to compound continuously  If we want to  use the future value formula with continuous compounding we need to find the limiting value  of the future value factor for m      infinitely many compounding periods per year  in  Equation    The expression for the future value of a sum in N years with continuous  compounding is

3,347,The Future Value of a Lump Sum with  Continuous Compounding
4,347,Suppose a        investment will earn   percent compounded continuously for two  years  We can compute the future value with Equation   as follows 
5,347,PV          rs             N     FVN   PVers N         e                                       
6,347,With the same interest rate but using continuous compounding the        investment  will grow to           in two years compared with           using quarterly  compounding as shown in Example   
7,347,Table   shows how a stated annual interest rate of   percent generates different ending dollar  amounts with annual semiannual quarterly monthly daily and continuous compounding for  an initial investment of     carried out to six decimal places  
8,347,As Table   shows all six cases have the same stated annual interest rate of   percent  they have  different ending dollar amounts however because of differences in the frequency of  compounding  With annual compounding the ending amount is        More frequent  compounding results in larger ending amounts  The ending dollar amount with continuous  compounding is the maximum amount that can be earned with a stated annual rate of   percent

2,348,Table   also shows that a    investment earning      percent compounded annually grows to  the same future value at the end of one year as a    investment earning   percent compounded  semiannually  This result leads us to a distinction between the stated annual interest rate and the  effective annual rate  EAR    For an   percent stated annual interest rate with semiannual  compounding the EAR is      percent 
3,348,     Stated and Effective Rates
4,348,The stated annual interest rate does not give a future value directly so we need a formula for  the EAR  With an annual interest rate of   percent compounded semiannually we receive a  periodic rate of   percent  During the course of a year an investment of    would grow to                      as illustrated in Table    The interest earned on the    investment is          and represents an effective annual rate of interest of      percent  The effective annual rate is  calculated as follows 
5,348,Equation    
6,348,EAR        Periodic interest rate m    
7,348,The periodic interest rate is the stated annual interest rate divided by m where m is the number  of compounding periods in one year  Using our previous example we can solve for EAR as  follows                     percent 
8,348,The concept of EAR extends to continuous compounding  Suppose we have a rate of   percent  compounded continuously  We can find the EAR in the same way as above by finding the  appropriate future value factor  In this case a    investment would grow to   e                      The interest earned for one year represents an effective annual rate of      percent and  is larger than the      percent EAR with semiannual compounding because interest is  compounded more frequently  With continuous compounding we can solve for the effective  annual rate as follows 
9,348,Equation    
10,348,EAR   ers    
11,348,We can reverse the formulas for EAR with discrete and continuous compounding to find a  periodic rate that corresponds to a particular effective annual rate  Suppose we want to find the  appropriate periodic rate for a given effective annual rate of      percent with semiannual  compounding  We can use Equation   to find the periodic rate

13,348,To calculate the continuously compounded rate  the stated annual interest rate with continuous  compounding  corresponding to an effective annual rate of      percent we find the interest  rate that satisfies Equation

3,349,To solve this equation we take the natural logarithm of both sides   Recall that the natural log  of ers is ln ers   rs    Therefore ln          rs resulting in rs     percent  We see that a stated  annual rate of   percent with continuous compounding is equivalent to an EAR of      percent 
4,349,   THE FUTURE VALUE OF A SERIES OF CASH  FLOWS
5,349,In this section we consider series of cash flows both even and uneven  We begin with a list of  terms commonly used when valuing cash flows that are distributed over many time periods 
6,349,  An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows 
7,349,  An ordinary annuity has a first cash flow that occurs one period from now  indexed at t      
8,349,  An annuity due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately  indexed at t      
9,349,  A perpetuity is a perpetual annuity or a set of level never ending sequential cash flows  with the first cash flow occurring one period from now 
10,349,     Equal Cash Flows Ordinary Annuity
11,349,Consider an ordinary annuity paying   percent annually  Suppose we have five separate  deposits of       occurring at equally spaced intervals of one year with the first payment  occurring at t      Our goal is to find the future value of this ordinary annuity after the last  deposit at t      The increment in the time counter is one year so the last payment occurs five  years from now  As the time line in Figure   shows we find the future value of each        deposit as of t     with Equation   FVN   PV     r N  The arrows in Figure   extend from the  payment date to t      For instance the first       deposit made at t     will compound over  four periods  Using Equation   we find that the future value of the first deposit at t     is                           We calculate the future value of all other payments in a similar  fashion   Note that we are finding the future value at t     so the last payment does not earn any  interest   With all values now at t     we can add the future values to arrive at the future value  of the annuity  This amount is

2,350,Figure    The Future Value of a Five Year Ordinary Annuity
3,350,We can arrive at a general annuity formula if we define the annuity amount as A the number of  time periods as N and the interest rate per period as r  We can then define the future value as
4,350,FVN   A       r N           r N           r N               r          r

11,350,The term in brackets is the future value annuity factor  This factor gives the future value of an  ordinary annuity of    per period  Multiplying the future value annuity factor by the annuity  amount gives the future value of an ordinary annuity  For the ordinary annuity in Figure   we  find the future value annuity factor from Equation   as

16,350,The next example illustrates how to find the future value of an ordinary annuity using the  formula in Equation

15,351,Assuming the fund continues to earn an average of   percent per year you will have              available at retirement 
16,351,     Unequal Cash Flows
17,351,In many cases cash flow streams are unequal precluding the simple use of the future value  annuity factor  For instance an individual investor might have a savings plan that involves  unequal cash payments depending on the month of the year or lower savings during a planned  vacation  One can always find the future value of a series of unequal cash flows by  compounding the cash flows one at a time  Suppose you have the five cash flows described in  Table   indexed relative to the present  t

2,352,All of the payments shown in Table   are different  Therefore the most direct approach to  finding the future value at t     is to compute the future value of each payment as of t     and  then sum the individual future values  The total future value at Year   equals           as  shown in the third column  Later in this reading you will learn shortcuts to take when the cash  flows are close to even  these shortcuts will allow you to combine annuity and single period  calculations 
3,352,   THE PRESENT VALUE OF A SINGLE CASH  FLOW
4,352,     Finding the Present Value of a Single Cash Flow
5,352,Just as the future value factor links today s present value with tomorrow s future value the  present value factor allows us to discount future value to present value  For example with a    percent interest rate generating a future payoff of      in one year what current amount  invested at   percent for one year will grow to       The answer is       therefore      is the  present value of      to be received in one year at a discount rate of   percent 
6,352,Given a future cash flow that is to be received in N periods and an interest rate per period of r  we can use the formula for future value to solve directly for the present value as follows 
7,352,Equation    
8,352,FVN   PV     r N PV   FVN   PV   FVN      r  N
9,352,     r N
10,352, 
11,352,We see from Equation   that the present value factor      r  N is the reciprocal of the future  value factor      r N

7,354,Present value problems require an evaluation of the present value factor      r  N  Present  values relate to the discount rate and the number of periods in the following ways 
8,354,  For a given discount rate the farther in the future the amount to be received the smaller  that amount s present value 
9,354,  Holding time constant the larger the discount rate the smaller the present value of a  future amount 
10,354,     The Frequency of Compounding
11,354,Recall that interest may be paid semiannually quarterly monthly or even daily  To handle  interest payments made more than once a year we can modify the present value formula   Equation    as follows  Recall that rs is the quoted interest rate and equals the periodic interest  rate multiplied by the number of compounding periods in each year  In general with more than  one compounding period in a year we can express the formula for present value as

9,355,The formula in Equation   is quite similar to that in Equation    As we have already noted  present value and future value factors are reciprocals  Changing the frequency of compounding  does not alter this result  The only difference is the use of the periodic interest rate and the  corresponding number of compounding periods 
10,355,The following example illustrates Equation

2,356,   THE PRESENT VALUE OF A SERIES OF CASH  FLOWS
3,356,Many applications in investment management involve assets that offer a series of cash flows  over time  The cash flows may be highly uneven relatively even or equal  They may occur  over relatively short periods of time longer periods of time or even stretch on indefinitely  In  this section we discuss how to find the present value of a series of cash flows 
4,356,     The Present Value of a Series of Equal Cash Flows
5,356,We begin with an ordinary annuity  Recall that an ordinary annuity has equal annuity payments  with the first payment starting one period into the future  In total the annuity makes N payments with the first payment at t     and the last at t   N  We can express the present value  of an ordinary annuity as the sum of the present values of each individual annuity payment as  follows

22,356,where
23,356,A   the annuity amount
24,356,r   the interest rate per period corresponding to the frequency of annuity payments  for  example annual quarterly or monthly 
25,356,N   the number of annuity payments
26,356,Because the annuity payment  A  is a constant in this equation it can be factored out as a  common term  Thus the sum of the interest factors has a shortcut expression

2,357,The Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity
3,357,Suppose you are considering purchasing a financial asset that promises to pay        per year for five years with the first payment one year from now  The required rate of  return is    percent per year  How much should you pay for this asset

2,358,As Figure   shows we can view the four period annuity due as the sum of two parts  a       lump sum today and an ordinary annuity of      per period for three periods  At a    percent  discount rate the four      cash flows in this annuity due example will be worth          
3,358,Expressing the value of the future series of cash flows in today s dollars gives us a convenient  way of comparing annuities  The next example illustrates this approach 
4,358,EXAMPLE   
5,358,An Annuity Due as the Present Value of an  Immediate Cash Flow Plus an Ordinary  Annuity
6,358,You are retiring today and must choose to take your retirement benefits either as a lump  sum or as an annuity  Your company s benefits officer presents you with two  alternatives  an immediate lump sum of    million or an annuity with    payments of          a year with the first payment starting today  The interest rate at your bank is    percent per year compounded annually  Which option has the greater present value    Ignore any tax differences between the two options  
7,358,Solution 
8,358,To compare the two options find the present value of each at time t     and choose the  one with the larger value  The first option s present value is    million already  expressed in today s dollars  The second option is an annuity due  Because the first  payment occurs at t     you can separate the annuity benefits into two pieces  an  immediate         to be paid today  t      and an ordinary annuity of         per  year for    years  To value this option you need to find the present value of the ordinary  annuity using Equation    and then add         to it

3,359,EXAMPLE   
4,359,The Projected Present Value of an Ordinary  Annuity
5,359,A German pension fund manager anticipates that benefits of    million per year must be  paid to retirees  Retirements will not occur until    years from now at time t       Once  benefits begin to be paid they will extend until t      for a total of    payments  What  is the present value of the pension liability if the appropriate annual discount rate for  plan liabilities is   percent compounded annually 
6,359,Solution 
7,359,This problem involves an annuity with the first payment at t       From the perspective  of t     we have an ordinary annuity with    payments  We can compute the present  value of this annuity with Equation    and then look at it on a time line

2,360,On the time line we have shown the pension payments of    million extending from t       to t       The bracket and arrow indicate the process of finding the present value of  the annuity discounted back to t      The present value of the pension benefits as of t      is               The problem is to find the present value today  at t      
3,360,Now we can rely on the equivalence of present value and future value  As Figure   shows we can view the amount at t     as a future value from the vantage point of t       We compute the present value of the amount at t     as follows

16,360,     The Present Value of an Infinite Series of Equal Cash  Flows Perpetuity
17,360,Consider the case of an ordinary annuity that extends indefinitely  Such an ordinary annuity is  called a perpetuity  a perpetual annuity   To derive a formula for the present value of a  perpetuity we can modify Equation    to account for an infinite series of cash flows

4,361,To see this look back at Equation    the expression for the present value of an ordinary  annuity  As N  the number of periods in the annuity  goes to infinity the term        r N approaches   and Equation    simplifies to Equation     This equation will reappear when we  value dividends from stocks because stocks have no predefined life span   A stock paying  constant dividends is similar to a perpetuity   With the first payment a year from now a  perpetuity of     per year with a    percent required rate of return has a present value of                
5,361,Equation    is valid only for a perpetuity with level payments  In our development above the  first payment occurred at t      therefore we compute the present value as of t     
6,361,Other assets also come close to satisfying the assumptions of a perpetuity  Certain government  bonds and preferred stocks are typical examples of financial assets that make level payments for  an indefinite period of time 
7,361,EXAMPLE   
8,361,The Present Value of a Perpetuity
9,361,The British government once issued a type of security called a consol bond which  promised to pay a level cash flow indefinitely  If a consol bond paid      per year in  perpetuity what would it be worth today if the required rate of return were   percent 
10,361,Solution 
11,361,To answer this question we can use Equation    with the following data 
12,361,A        r             PV   A r                    
13,361,The bond would be worth       
14,361,     Present Values Indexed at Times Other than t    
15,361,In practice with investments analysts frequently need to find present values indexed at times  other than t      Subscripting the present value and evaluating a perpetuity beginning with       payments in Year   we find PV                      at a   percent discount rate  Further we  can calculate today s PV as PV

2,362,Consider a similar situation in which cash flows of    per year begin at the end of the  th year  and continue at the end of each year thereafter with the last cash flow at the end of the   th  year  From the perspective of the end of the third year we are facing a typical seven year  ordinary annuity  We can find the present value of the annuity from the perspective of the end  of the third year and then discount that present value back to the present  At an interest rate of    percent the cash flows of    per year starting at the end of the fourth year will be worth         at the end of the third year  t      and        today  t      
3,362,The next example illustrates the important concept that an annuity or perpetuity beginning  sometime in the future can be expressed in present value terms one period prior to the first  payment  That present value can then be discounted back to today s present value

7,362,Solution 
8,362,First we find the present value of the perpetuity at t     and then discount that amount  back to t       Recall that a perpetuity or an ordinary annuity has its first payment one  period away explaining the t     index for our present value calculation

2,363,As discussed earlier an annuity is a series of payments of a fixed amount for a specified  number of periods  Suppose we own a perpetuity  At the same time we issue a perpetuity  obligating us to make payments  these payments are the same size as those of the perpetuity we  own  However the first payment of the perpetuity we issue is at t      payments then continue  on forever  The payments on this second perpetuity exactly offset the payments received from  the perpetuity we own at t     and all subsequent dates  We are left with level nonzero net cash  flows at t         and    This outcome exactly fits the definition of an annuity with four  payments  Thus we can construct an annuity as the difference between two perpetuities with  equal level payments but differing starting dates  The next example illustrates this result 
3,363,EXAMPLE   
4,363,The Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity as  the Present Value of a Current Minus  Projected Perpetuity
5,363,Given a   percent discount rate find the present value of a four year ordinary annuity of       per year starting in Year   as the difference between the following two level  perpetuities 
6,363,Perpetuity        per year starting in Year    first payment at t       Perpetuity        per year starting in Year    first payment at t     
7,363,Solution 
8,363,If we subtract Perpetuity   from Perpetuity   we are left with an ordinary annuity of       per period for four years  payments at t             Subtracting the present value  of Perpetuity   from that of Perpetuity   we arrive at the present value of the four year  ordinary annuity

6,364,We could calculate the future value of these cash flows by computing them one at a time using  the single payment future value formula  We already know the present value of this series  however so we can easily apply time value equivalence  The future value of the series of cash  flows from Table             is equal to the single           amount compounded forward  to t

2,365,   SOLVING FOR RATES NUMBER OF PERIODS  OR SIZE OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS
3,365,In the previous examples certain pieces of information have been made available  For instance  all problems have given the rate of interest r the number of time periods N the annuity  amount A and either the present value PV or future value FV  In real world applications  however although the present and future values may be given you may have to solve for either  the interest rate the number of periods or the annuity amount  In the subsections that follow  we show these types of problems 
4,365,     Solving for Interest Rates and Growth Rates
5,365,Suppose a bank deposit of      is known to generate a payoff of      in one year  With this  information we can infer the interest rate that separates the present value of      from the  future value of      by using Equation   FVN   PV     r N with N      With PV FV and N known we can solve for r directly

9,365,The interest rate that equates      at t     to      at t     is    percent  Thus we can state that       grows to      with a growth rate of    percent 
10,365,As this example shows an interest rate can also be considered a growth rate  The particular  application will usually dictate whether we use the term  interest rate  or  growth rate    Solving Equation   for r and replacing the interest rate r with the growth rate g produces the  following expression for determining growth rates

6,366,g                                                                      or about     
7,366,The calculated growth rate of about     percent a year shows that Hyundai Steel s sales  grew substantially during the           period

2,368,In conclusion we do not need to compute intermediate growth rates as in Table   to  solve for a compound growth rate g  Sometimes however the intermediate growth rates  are interesting or informative  For example at first  from      to       Toyota Motors  increased its number of vehicles sold  We can also analyze the variability in growth  rates when we conduct an analysis as in Table    Most of the decline in Toyota Motor s  sales occurred in       Elsewhere in Toyota Motor s disclosures the company noted  that the substantial decline in vehicle sales in      was due to the steep downturn in the  global economy  Sales declined further in      as the market conditions remained  difficult  Each of the next two years saw a slight increase in sales 
3,368,The compound growth rate is an excellent summary measure of growth over multiple time  periods  In our Toyota Motors example the compound growth rate of      percent is the single  growth rate that when added to   compounded over five years and multiplied by the       number of vehicles sold yields the      number of vehicles sold

2,369,     Solving for the Size of Annuity Payments

7,369,Solution 
8,369,The bank will determine the mortgage payments such that at the stated periodic interest  rate the present value of the payments will be equal to the amount borrowed  in this  case           With this fact in mind we can use Equation    PV   A   to solve for the annuity amount A as the present value divided by the present value  annuity factor

2,370,Next we turn to a retirement planning problem  This problem illustrates the complexity of the  situation in which an individual wants to retire with a specified retirement income  Over the  course of a life cycle the individual may be able to save only a small amount during the early  years but then may have the financial resources to save more during later years  Savings plans  often involve uneven cash flows a topic we will examine in the last part of this reading  When  dealing with uneven cash flows we take maximum advantage of the principle that dollar  amounts indexed at the same point in time are additive the cash flow additivity principle 
3,370,EXAMPLE   
4,370,The Projected Annuity Amount Needed to  Fund a Future Annuity Inflow
5,370,Jill Grant is    years old  at t      and is planning for her retirement at age     at t         She plans to save       per year for the next    years  t     to t        She wants to  have retirement income of         per year for    years with the first retirement  payment starting at t       How much must Grant save each year from t      to t      in  order to achieve her retirement goal  Assume she plans to invest in a diversified stock  and bond mutual fund that will earn   percent per year on average 
6,370,Solution 
7,370,To help solve this problem we set up the information on a time line  As Figure   shows  Grant will save        an outflow  each year for Years   to     Starting in Year     Grant will start to draw retirement income of         per year for    years  In the time  line the annual savings is recorded in parentheses      to show that it is an outflow  The  problem is to find the savings recorded as X from Year    to Year    
8,370,Figure    Solving for Missing Annuity Payments  in Thousands 
9,370,Solving this problem involves satisfying the following relationship  the present value of  savings  outflows  equals the present value of retirement income  inflows   We could  bring all the dollar amounts to t      or to t      and solve for X 
10,370,Let us evaluate all dollar amounts at t       we encourage the reader to repeat the  problem by bringing all cash flows to t        As of t      the first payment of X will be  one period away  at t        Thus we can value the stream of Xs using the formula for  the present value of an ordinary annuity 
11,370,This problem involves three series of level cash flows  The basic idea is that the present  value of the retirement income must equal the present value of Grant s savings  Our  strategy requires the following steps

2,371,   Find the future value of the savings of       per year and index it at t       This  value tells us how much Grant will have saved 
3,371,   Find the present value of the retirement income at t       This value tells us how  much Grant needs to meet her retirement goals  as of t        Two substeps are  necessary  First calculate the present value of the annuity of         per year at  t       Use the formula for the present value of an annuity   Note that the present  value is indexed at t      because the first payment is at t        Next discount  the present value back to t       a total of    periods  
4,371,   Now compute the difference between the amount Grant has saved  Step    and the  amount she needs to meet her retirement goals  Step     Her savings from t       to t      must have a present value equal to the difference between the future  value of her savings and the present value of her retirement income 
5,371,Our goal is to determine the amount Grant should save in each of the    years from t       to t       We start by bringing the       savings to t      as follows

11,371,At t      Grant s initial savings will have grown to           
12,371,Now we need to know the value of Grant s retirement income at t       As stated  earlier computing the retirement present value requires two substeps  First find the  present value at t      with the formula in Equation     second discount this present  value back to t       Now we can find the retirement income present value at t

3,372,Now recall that Grant will have saved           by t       Therefore in present value  terms the annuity from t      to t      must equal the difference between the amount  already saved             and the amount required for retirement               This  amount is equal to                                     Therefore we must now  find the annuity payment A from t      to t      that has a present value of             We find the annuity payment as follows

16,372,     Review of Present and Future Value Equivalence
17,372,As we have demonstrated finding present and future values involves moving amounts of  money to different points on a time line  These operations are possible because present value  and future value are equivalent measures separated in time  Table   illustrates this equivalence   it lists the timing of five cash flows their present values at t     and their future values at t

2,373,To interpret Table   start with the third column which shows the present values  Note that  each       cash payment is discounted back the appropriate number of periods to find the  present value at t      The present value of          is exactly equivalent to the series of cash  flows  This information illustrates an important point  A lump sum can actually generate an  annuity  If we place a lump sum in an account that earns the stated interest rate for all periods  we can generate an annuity that is equivalent to the lump sum  Amortized loans such as  mortgages and car loans are examples of this principle

2,374,To interpret Table   start with an initial present value of          at t      From t     to t      the initial investment earns   percent interest generating a future value of                             We then withdraw       from our account leaving                               the figure reported in the last column for time period     In the next period we earn  one year s worth of interest and then make a       withdrawal  After the fourth withdrawal  we have         which earns   percent  This amount then grows to       during the year just  enough for us to make the last withdrawal  Thus the initial present value when invested at    percent for five years generates the       five year ordinary annuity  The present value of the  initial investment is exactly equivalent to the annuity 
3,374,Now we can look at how future value relates to annuities  In Table   we reported that the  future value of the annuity was           We arrived at this figure by compounding the first        payment forward four periods the second       forward three periods and so on  We  then added the five future amounts at t      The annuity is equivalent to          at t     and           at t      These two dollar measures are thus equivalent  We can verify the  equivalence by finding the present value of          which is                                  We found this result above when we showed that a lump sum can generate an  annuity

3,375,Consider the two series of cash flows shown on the time line in Figure    The series are denoted  A and B  If we assume that the annual interest rate is   percent we can find the future value of  each series of cash flows as follows  Series A s future value is                            Series B s future value is                           The future value of  A   B  is                     by the method we have used up to this point  The alternative way to find the future  value is to add the cash flows of each series A and B  call it A   B  and then find the future  value of the combined cash flow as shown in Figure   
4,375,The third time line in Figure   shows the combined series of cash flows  Series A has a cash  flow of      at t     and Series B has a cash flow of      at t      The combined series thus  has a cash flow of      at t      We can similarly calculate the cash flow of the combined series  at t      The future value of the combined series  A   B  is                          the  same result we found when we added the future values of each series 
5,375,The additivity and equivalence principles also appear in another common situation  Suppose  cash flows are    at the end of the first year and      actually separate payments of    and       at the end of the second year  Rather than finding present values of the first year s    and the  second year s     we can treat this situation as a    annuity for two years and a second year      lump sum  If the discount rate were   percent the    annuity would have a present value of        and the     lump sum a present value of        for a total of

2,376,SUMMARY
3,376,In this reading we have explored a foundation topic in investment mathematics the time value  of money  We have developed and reviewed the following concepts for use in financial  applications 
4,376,  The interest rate r is the required rate of return  r is also called the discount rate or  opportunity cost 
5,376,  An interest rate can be viewed as the sum of the real risk free interest rate and a set of  premiums that compensate lenders for risk  an inflation premium a default risk premium  a liquidity premium and a maturity premium 
6,376,  The future value FV is the present value PV times the future value factor      r N 
7,376,  The interest rate r makes current and future currency amounts equivalent based on their  time value 
8,376,  The stated annual interest rate is a quoted interest rate that does not account for  compounding within the year 
9,376,  The periodic rate is the quoted interest rate per period  it equals the stated annual interest  rate divided by the number of compounding periods per year 
10,376,  The effective annual rate is the amount by which a unit of currency will grow in a year  with interest on interest included 
11,376,  An annuity is a finite set of level sequential cash flows 
12,376,  There are two types of annuities the annuity due and the ordinary annuity  The annuity  due has a first cash flow that occurs immediately  the ordinary annuity has a first cash  flow that occurs one period from the present  indexed at t      
13,376,  On a time line we can index the present as   and then display equally spaced hash marks  to represent a number of periods into the future  This representation allows us to index  how many periods away each cash flow will be paid 
14,376,  Annuities may be handled in a similar fashion as single payments if we use annuity  factors instead of single payment factors 
15,376,  The present value PV is the future value FV times the present value factor      r  N 
16,376,  The present value of a perpetuity is A r where A is the periodic payment to be received  forever 
17,376,  It is possible to calculate an unknown variable given the other relevant variables in time  value of money problems 
18,376,  The cash flow additivity principle can be used to solve problems with uneven cash flows  by combining single payments and annuities

4,377,   The table below gives current information on the interest rates for two two year and two  eight year maturity investments  The table also gives the maturity liquidity and default  risk characteristics of a new investment possibility  Investment     All investments  promise only a single payment  a payment at maturity   Assume that premiums relating to  inflation liquidity and default risk are constant across all time horizons

6,377,Based on the information in the above table address the following 
7,377,A  Explain the difference between the interest rates on Investment   and Investment   
8,377,B  Estimate the default risk premium 
9,377,C  Calculate upper and lower limits for the interest rate on Investment   r  
10,377,   A couple plans to set aside        per year in a conservative portfolio projected to earn    percent a year  If they make their first savings contribution one year from now how  much will they have at the end of    years 
11,377,   Two years from now a client will receive the first of three annual payments of         from a small business project  If she can earn   percent annually on her investments and  plans to retire in six years how much will the three business project payments be worth at  the time of her retirement 
12,377,   To cover the first year s total college tuition payments for his two children a father will  make a        payment five years from now  How much will he need to invest today to  meet his first tuition goal if the investment earns   percent annually 
13,377,   A client can choose between receiving    annual         retirement payments starting  one year from today or receiving a lump sum today  Knowing that he can invest at a rate  of   percent annually he has decided to take the lump sum  What lump sum today will be  equivalent to the future annual payments 
14,377,   You are considering investing in two different instruments  The first instrument will pay  nothing for three years but then it will pay        per year for four years  The second  instrument will pay        for three years and        in the fourth year  All payments  are made at year end  If your required rate of return on these investments is   percent  annually what should you be willing to pay for 
15,377,A  The first instrument

2,378,B  The second instrument  use the formula for a four year annuity  
3,378,   Suppose you plan to send your daughter to college in three years  You expect her to earn  two thirds of her tuition payment in scholarship money so you estimate that your  payments will be        a year for four years  To estimate whether you have set aside  enough money you ignore possible inflation in tuition payments and assume that you can  earn   percent annually on your investments  How much should you set aside now to  cover these payments 
4,378,   A client plans to send a child to college for four years starting    years from now  Having  set aside money for tuition she decides to plan for room and board also  She estimates  these costs at        per year payable at the beginning of each year by the time her  child goes to college  If she starts next year and makes    payments into a savings  account paying   percent annually what annual payments must she make 
5,378,   A couple plans to pay their child s college tuition for   years starting    years from now   The current annual cost of college is C      and they expect this cost to rise at an  annual rate of   percent  In their planning they assume that they can earn   percent  annually  How much must they put aside each year starting next year if they plan to  make    equal payments 
6,378,    The nominal risk free rate is best described as the sum of the real risk free rate and a  premium for

6,382,A  Investment   is identical to Investment   except that Investment   has low liquidity   The difference between the interest rate on Investment   and Investment   is      percentage point  This amount represents the liquidity premium which represents  compensation for the risk of loss relative to an investment s fair value if the  investment needs to be converted to cash quickly 
7,382,B  To estimate the default risk premium find the two investments that have the same  maturity but different levels of default risk  Both Investments   and   have a  maturity of eight years  Investment   however has low liquidity and thus bears a  liquidity premium  The difference between the interest rates of Investments   and    is     percentage points  The liquidity premium is     percentage point  from Part  A   This leaves                 percentage points that must represent a default risk  premium reflecting Investment   s high default risk 
8,382,C  Investment   has liquidity risk and default risk comparable to Investment   but  with its longer time to maturity Investment   should have a higher maturity  premium  The interest rate on Investment   r  should thus be above     percent   the interest rate on Investment     If the liquidity of Investment   were high  Investment   would match Investment   except for Investment   s shorter maturity   We would then conclude that Investment   s interest rate should be less than the  interest rate on Investment   which is   percent  In contrast to Investment    however Investment   has low liquidity  It is possible that the interest rate on  Investment   exceeds that of Investment   despite   s shorter maturity depending  on the relative size of the liquidity and maturity premiums  However we expect r  to be less than     percent the expected interest rate on Investment   if it had low  liquidity  Thus     percent   r        percent

6,396, Technically   plus the nominal rate equals the product of   plus the real rate and   plus the inflation rate  As a  quick approximation however the nominal rate is equal to the real rate plus an inflation premium  In this  discussion we focus on approximate additive relationships to highlight the underlying concepts 
7,396, Other developed countries issue securities similar to US Treasury bills  The French government issues BTFs or  negotiable fixed rate discount Treasury bills  Bons du Tr sor   taux fixe et   int r ts pr compt s  with maturities  of up to one year  The Japanese government issues a short term Treasury bill with maturities of   and    months   The German government issues at discount both Treasury financing paper  Finanzierungssch tze des Bundes or  for short Sch tze  and Treasury discount paper  Bubills  with maturities up to    months  In the United Kingdom  the British government issues gilt edged Treasury bills with maturities ranging from   to     days  The Canadian  government bond market is closely related to the US market  Canadian Treasury bills have maturities of     and     months 
8,396, We could also solve time value of money problems using tables of interest rate factors  Solutions using tabled  values of interest rate factors are generally less accurate than solutions obtained using calculators or spreadsheets  so practitioners prefer calculators or spreadsheets 
9,396, To avoid rounding errors when using a financial calculator divide   by    and then press the  i key rather than  simply entering      for  i so we have                            
10,396, Among the terms used for the effective annual return on interest bearing bank deposits are annual percentage  yield  APY  in the United States and equivalent annual rate  EAR  in the United Kingdom  By contrast the  annual percentage rate  APR  measures the cost of borrowing expressed as a yearly rate  In the United States  the APR is calculated as a periodic rate times the number of payment periods per year and as a result some writers  use APR as a general synonym for the stated annual interest rate  Nevertheless APR is a term with legal  connotations  its calculation follows regulatory standards that vary internationally  Therefore  stated annual  interest rate  is the preferred general term for an annual interest rate that does not account for compounding within  the year 
11,396, There is an alternative way to calculate the present value of an annuity due  Compared to an ordinary annuity the  payments in an annuity due are each discounted one less period  Therefore we can modify Equation    to handle  annuities due by multiplying the right hand side of the equation by      r

13,396, The compound growth rate that we calculate here is an example of a geometric mean specifically the geometric  mean of the growth rates  We define the geometric mean in the reading on statistical concepts 
14,396, To quickly approximate the number of periods practitioners sometimes use an ad hoc rule called the Rule of      Divide    by the stated interest rate to get the approximate number of years it would take to double an investment  at the interest rate  Here the approximation gives             years  The Rule of    is loosely based on the  observation that it takes    years to double an amount at a   percent interest rate giving              At a   percent  rate one would guess it would take twice as many years

2,399,   INTRODUCTION
3,399,As investment analysts much of our work includes evaluating transactions involving present  and future cash flows  In the reading on the time value of money  TVM  we presented the  mathematics needed to solve those problems and illustrated the techniques for the major  problem types  In this reading we turn to applications  Analysts must master the numerous  applications of TVM or discounted cash flow analysis in equity fixed income and derivatives  analysis as they study each of those topics individually  In this reading we present a selection  of important TVM applications  net present value and internal rate of return as tools for  evaluating cash flow streams portfolio return measurement and the calculation of money  market yields  Important in themselves these applications also introduce concepts that reappear  in many other investment contexts 
4,399,The reading is organized as follows  Section   introduces two key TVM concepts net present  value and internal rate of return  Building on these concepts Section   discusses a key topic in  investment management portfolio return measurement  Investment managers often face the task  of investing funds for the short term  to understand the choices available they need to  understand the calculation of money market yields  The reading thus concludes with a  discussion of that topic in Section   
5,399,   NET PRESENT VALUE AND INTERNAL RATE  OF RETURN
6,399,In applying discounted cash flow analysis in all fields of finance we repeatedly encounter two  concepts net present value and internal rate of return  In the following sections we present these  keystone concepts 
7,399,We could explore the concepts of net present value and internal rate of return in many contexts  because their scope of application covers all areas of finance  Capital budgeting however can  serve as a representative starting point  Capital budgeting is important not only in corporate  finance but also in security analysis because both equity and fixed income analysts must be  able to assess how well managers are investing the assets of their companies  There are three  chief areas of financial decision making in most businesses  Capital budgeting is the  allocation of funds to relatively long range projects or investments  From the perspective of  capital budgeting a company is a portfolio of projects and investments  Capital structure is  the choice of long term financing for the investments the company wants to make  Working  capital management is the management of the company s short term assets  such as  inventory  and short term liabilities  such as money owed to suppliers

2,400,     Net Present Value and the Net Present Value Rule
3,400,Net present value  NPV  describes a way to characterize the value of an investment and the net  present value rule is a method for choosing among alternative investments  The net present  value of an investment is the present value of its cash inflows minus the present value of its  cash outflows  The word  net  in net present value refers to subtracting the present value of the  investment s outflows  costs  from the present value of its inflows  benefits  to arrive at the net  benefit 
4,400,The steps in computing NPV and applying the NPV rule are as follows 
5,400,   Identify all cash flows associated with the investment all inflows and outflows  
6,400,   Determine the appropriate discount rate or opportunity cost r for the investment  project  
7,400,   Using that discount rate find the present value of each cash flow   Inflows have a  positive sign and increase NPV  outflows have a negative sign and decrease NPV  
8,400,   Sum all present values  The sum of the present values of all cash flows  inflows and  outflows  is the investment s net present value 
9,400,   Apply the NPV rule  If the investment s NPV is positive an investor should undertake it   if the NPV is negative the investor should not undertake it  If an investor has two  candidates for investment but can only invest in one  i e  mutually exclusive  projects  the investor should choose the candidate with the higher positive NPV 
10,400,What is the meaning of the NPV rule  In calculating the NPV of an investment proposal we  use an estimate of the opportunity cost of capital as the discount rate  The opportunity cost of  capital is the alternative return that investors forgo in undertaking the investment  When NPV is  positive the investment adds value because it more than covers the opportunity cost of the  capital needed to undertake it  So a company undertaking a positive NPV investment increases  shareholders  wealth  An individual investor making a positive NPV investment increases  personal wealth but a negative NPV investment decreases wealth 
11,400,When working problems using the NPV rule it will be helpful to refer to the following formula

2,401,As always we state the inputs on a compatible time basis  If cash flows are annual N is the  project s life in years and r is an annual rate  For instance suppose you are reviewing a  proposal that requires an initial outlay of    million  CF        million   You expect that the  proposed investment will generate net positive cash flows of CF          million at the end of  Year   CF          million at the end of Year   and CF          million at the end of Year     Using    percent as a discount rate you calculate the NPV as follows 
3,401,NPV                                                                                                              million
4,401,Because the NPV of        is positive you accept the proposal under the NPV rule 
5,401,Consider an example in which a research and development program is evaluated using the NPV  rule 
6,401,EXAMPLE  
7,401,Evaluating a Research and Development  Program Using the NPV Rule
8,401,As an analyst covering the RAD Corporation you are evaluating its research and  development  R D  program for the current year  Management has announced that it  intends to invest    million in R D  Incremental net cash flows are forecasted to be          per year in perpetuity  RAD Corporation s opportunity cost of capital is     percent 
9,401,   State whether RAD s R D program will benefit shareholders as judged by the  NPV rule 
10,401,   Evaluate whether your answer to Part   changes if RAD Corporation s  opportunity cost of capital is    percent rather than    percent 
11,401,Solution to   
12,401,The constant net cash flows of         which we can denote as      CF  form a  perpetuity  The present value of the perpetuity is      CF  r so we calculate the project s  NPV as
13,401,NPV   CF         CF  r                                    
14,401,With an opportunity cost of    percent the present value of the program s cash inflows  is      million  The program s cost is an immediate outflow of    million  therefore its  net present value is          As NPV is positive you conclude that RAD  Corporation s R D program will benefit shareholders 
15,401,Solution to   
16,401,With an opportunity cost of capital of    percent you compute the NPV as you did  above but this time you use a    percent discount rate

2,402,NPV                                
3,402,With a higher opportunity cost of capital the present value of the inflows is smaller and  the program s NPV is smaller  At    percent the NPV exactly equals     At NPV      the program generates just enough cash flow to compensate shareholders for the  opportunity cost of making the investment  When a company undertakes a zero NPV  project the company becomes larger but shareholders  wealth does not increase 
4,402,     The Internal Rate of Return and the Internal Rate of  Return Rule
5,402,Financial managers often want a single number that represents the rate of return generated by an  investment  The rate of return computation most often used in investment applications   including capital budgeting  is the internal rate of return  IRR   The internal rate of return rule  is a second method for choosing among investment proposals  The internal rate of return is  the discount rate that makes net present value equal to zero  It equates the present value of the  investment s costs  outflows  to the present value of the investment s benefits  inflows   The  rate is  internal  because it depends only on the cash flows of the investment  no external data  are needed  As a result we can apply the IRR concept to any investment that can be represented  as a series of cash flows  In the study of bonds we encounter IRR under the name of yield to  maturity  Later in this reading we will explore IRR as the money weighted rate of return for  portfolios 
6,402,Before we continue however we must add a note of caution about interpreting IRR  Even if  our cash flow projections are correct we will realize a compound rate of return that is equal to  IRR over the life of the investment only if we can reinvest all interim cash flows at exactly the  IRR  Suppose the IRR for a project is    percent but we consistently reinvest the cash generated  by the project at a lower rate  In this case we will realize a return that is less than    percent    This principle can work in our favor if we can reinvest at rates above    percent  
7,402,To return to the definition of IRR in mathematical terms we said the following 
8,402,Equation    
9,402,NPV   CF   
10,402,CF       IRR  
11,402,

13,402,     
14,402,CFN      IRR N
15,402,   
16,402,Again the IRR in Equation   must be compatible with the timing of the cash flows  If the cash  flows are quarterly we have a quarterly IRR in Equation    We can then state the IRR on an  annual basis  For some simple projects the cash flow at t     CF  captures the single capital  outlay or initial investment  cash flows after t     are the positive returns to the investment  In  such cases we can say CF     Investment  the negative sign indicates an outflow   Thus we can  rearrange Equation   in a form that is helpful in those cases

2,403,For most real life problems financial analysts use software spreadsheets or financial  calculators to solve this equation for IRR so you should familiarize yourself with such tools  
3,403,The investment decision rule using IRR the IRR rule states the following   Accept projects or  investments for which the IRR is greater than the opportunity cost of capital   The IRR rule  uses the opportunity cost of capital as a hurdle rate or rate that a project s IRR must exceed  for the project to be accepted  Note that if the opportunity cost of capital is equal to the IRR  then the NPV is equal to    If the project s opportunity cost is less than the IRR the NPV is  greater than    using a discount rate less than the IRR will make the NPV positive   With these  comments in mind we work through two examples that involve the internal rate of return 
4,403,EXAMPLE  
5,403,Evaluating a Research and Development  Program Using the IRR Rule
6,403,In the previous RAD Corporation example the initial outlay is    million and the  program s cash flows are         in perpetuity  Now you are interested in determining  the program s internal rate of return  Address the following 
7,403,   Write the equation for determining the internal rate of return of this R D  program 
8,403,   Calculate the IRR 
9,403,Solution to   
10,403,Finding the IRR is equivalent to finding the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to     Because the program s cash flows are a perpetuity you can set up the NPV equation  as
11,403,or as
12,403,NPV    Investment        CF  IRR     NPV                       IRR

2,404,Solution to   
3,404,We can solve for IRR as IRR                           or    percent  The solution  of    percent accords with the definition of IRR  In Example   you found that a  discount rate of    percent made the program s NPV equal to    By definition therefore  the program s IRR must be    percent  If the opportunity cost of capital is also     percent the R D program just covers its opportunity costs and neither increases nor  decreases shareholder wealth  If it is less than    percent the IRR rule indicates that  management should invest in the program because it more than covers its opportunity  cost  If the opportunity cost is greater than    percent the IRR rule tells management to  reject the R D program  For a given opportunity cost the IRR rule and the NPV rule  lead to the same decision in this example 
4,404,EXAMPLE  
5,404,The IRR and NPV Rules Side by Side
6,404,The Japanese company Kageyama Ltd  is considering whether or not to open a new  factory to manufacture capacitors used in cell phones  The factory will require an  investment of       million  The factory is expected to generate level cash flows of         million per year in each of the next five years  According to information in its  financial reports Kageyama s opportunity cost of capital for this type of project is     percent 
7,404,   Determine whether the project will benefit Kageyama s shareholders using the  NPV rule 
8,404,   Determine whether the project will benefit Kageyama s shareholders using the  IRR rule 
9,404,Solution to   
10,404,The cash flows can be grouped into an initial outflow of       million and an ordinary  annuity of five inflows of        million  The expression for the present value of an  annuity is A          r  N  r where A is the level annuity payment  Therefore with  amounts shown in millions of Japanese yen

3,405,This project s positive NPV tells us that the internal rate of return must be greater than     percent  Using a calculator we find that IRR is          or       percent  Table   gives the keystrokes on most financial calculators

6,405,Numerical Value for This  Problem   X             n a      
7,405,Because the IRR of       percent is greater than the opportunity cost of the project the  project should benefit Kageyama s shareholders  Whether it uses the IRR rule or the  NPV rule Kageyama makes the same decision  Build the factory 
8,405,In the previous example value creation is evident  For a single       million payment  Kageyama creates a project worth          million a value increase of        million   Another perspective on value creation comes from converting the initial investment into a  capital charge against the annual operating cash flows that the project generates  Recall that the  project generates an annual operating cash flow of             If we subtract a capital charge  of             the amount of a five year annuity having a present value of       million at     percent  we find                                      The amount of            represents the profit in each of the next five years after taking into account opportunity costs   The present value of a five year annuity of           at an    percent cost of capital is  exactly what we calculated as the project s NPV         million  Therefore we can also  calculate NPV by converting the initial investment to an annual capital charge against cash  flow 
9,405,     Problems with the IRR Rule
10,405,The IRR and NPV rules give the same accept or reject decision when projects are  independent that is when the decision to invest in one project does not affect the decision to  undertake another  When a company cannot finance all the projects it would like to  undertake that is when projects are mutually exclusive it must rank the projects from most  profitable to least  However rankings according to IRR and NPV may not be the same  The  IRR and NPV rules rank projects differently when

2,406,  the size or scale of the projects differs  measuring size by the investment needed to  undertake the project  or
3,406,  the timing of the projects  cash flows differs 
4,406,When the IRR and NPV rules conflict in ranking projects we should take directions from the  NPV rule  Why that preference  The NPV of an investment represents the expected addition to  shareholder wealth from an investment and we take the maximization of shareholder wealth to  be a basic financial objective of a company  To illustrate the preference for the NPV rule  consider first the case of projects that differ in size  Suppose that a company has only         available to invest   The company has available two one period investment projects described  as A and B in Table   
5,406,Table    IRR and NPV for Mutually Exclusive Projects of Different Size
6,406,Project A B

8,406,Project A requires an immediate investment of         This project will make a single cash  payment of        at t      Because the IRR is the discount rate that equates the present value  of the future cash flow with the cost of the investment the IRR equals    percent  If we assume  that the opportunity cost of capital is   percent then the NPV of Project A is           We  compute the IRR and NPV of Project B as    percent and          respectively  The IRR and  NPV rules indicate that we should undertake both projects but to do so we would need         more money than is available  So we need to rank the projects  How do the projects  rank according to IRR and NPV 
9,406,The IRR rule ranks Project A with the higher IRR first  The NPV rule however ranks Project  B with the higher NPV first a conflict with the IRR rule s ranking  Choosing Project A  because it has the higher IRR would not lead to the largest increase in shareholders  wealth   Investing in Project A effectively leaves                minus A s cost  uninvested  Project  A increases wealth by almost       but Project B increases wealth by almost        The  difference between the two projects  scale creates the inconsistency in the ranking between the  two rules 
10,406,IRR and NPV can also rank projects of the same scale differently when the timing of cash flows  differs  We can illustrate this principle with Projects A and D presented in Table

5,407,        
6,407,           IRR  
7,407,   
8,407,The IRR for Project D is      percent compared with    percent for Project A  IRRs and IRR  rankings are not affected by any external interest rate or discount rate because a project s cash  flows alone determine the internal rate of return  The IRR calculation furthermore assumes  reinvestment at the IRR so we generally cannot interpret them as achievable rates of return  For  Project D for example to achieve a      percent return we would need to earn      percent on         for the first year earn      percent on                        the second year and  earn      percent on                            the third year   A reinvestment rate such as     percent or      percent may be quite unrealistic  By contrast the calculation of NPV uses an  external market determined discount rate and reinvestment is assumed to take place at that  discount rate  NPV rankings can depend on the external discount rate chosen  Here Project D  has a larger but more distant cash inflow         versus          As a result Project D has a  higher NPV than Project A at lower discount rates   The NPV rule s assumption about  reinvestment rates is more realistic and more economically relevant because it incorporates the  market determined opportunity cost of capital as a discount rate  As a consequence the NPV is  the expected addition to shareholder wealth from an investment 
9,407,In summary when dealing with mutually exclusive projects choose among them using the  NPV rule when the IRR rule and NPV rule conflict  
10,407,   PORTFOLIO RETURN MEASUREMENT
11,407,Suppose you are an investor and you want to assess the success of your investments  You face  two related but distinct tasks  The first is performance measurement which involves  calculating returns in a logical and consistent manner  Accurate performance measurement  provides the basis for your second task performance appraisal   Performance measurement  is thus of great importance for all investors and investment managers because it is the  foundation for all further analysis 
12,407,In our discussion of portfolio return measurement we will use the fundamental concept of  holding period return  HPR  the return that an investor earns over a specified holding period   For an investment that makes one cash payment at the end of the holding period HPR    P     P    D   P  where P  is the initial investment P  is the price received at the end of the holding  period and D  is the cash paid by the investment at the end of the holding period

2,408,Particularly when we measure performance over many periods or when the portfolio is subject  to additions and withdrawals portfolio performance measurement is a challenging task  Two of  the measurement tools available are the money weighted rate of return measure and the time  weighted rate of return measure  The first measure we discuss the money weighted rate of  return implements a concept we have already covered in the context of capital budgeting   internal rate of return 
3,408,     Money Weighted Rate of Return
4,408,The first performance measurement concept that we will discuss is an internal rate of return  calculation  In investment management applications the internal rate of return is called the  money weighted rate of return because it accounts for the timing and amount of all cash flows  into and out of the portfolio  
5,408,To illustrate the money weighted return consider an investment that covers a two year horizon   At time t     an investor buys one share at       At time t     he purchases an additional share  at       At the end of Year   t     he sells both shares for      each  During both years the  stock pays a per share dividend of     The t     dividend is not reinvested  Table   shows the  total cash inflows and outflows 
6,408,Table    Cash Flows
7,408,Time Outlay        to purchase the first share        to purchase the second share

9,408,The money weighted return on this portfolio is its internal rate of return for the two year period   The portfolio s internal rate of return is the rate r for which the present value of the cash  inflows minus the present value of the cash outflows equals   or

2,409,The left hand side of this equation details the outflows       at time t     and      at time t       The      outflow is discounted back one period because it occurs at t      The right hand  side of the equation shows the present value of the inflows     at time t      discounted back  one period  and       the     dividend plus the      sale proceeds  at time t      discounted  back two periods  
3,409,To solve for the money weighted return we use either a financial calculator that allows us to  enter cash flows or a spreadsheet with an IRR function    The first step is to group net cash  flows by time  For this example we have       for the t     net cash flow                     for the t     net cash flow and      for the t     net cash flow  After entering these cash  flows we use the spreadsheet s or calculator s IRR function to find that the money weighted  rate of return is      percent   
4,409,Now we take a closer look at what has happened to the portfolio during each of the two years   In the first year the portfolio generated a one period holding period return of                               percent  At the beginning of the second year the amount invested is       calculated as       per share price of stock      shares because the    dividend was spent  rather than reinvested  At the end of the second year the proceeds from the liquidation of the  portfolio are       as detailed in Table    plus     in dividends  as also detailed in Table      So in the second year the portfolio produced a holding period return of                                  percent  The mean holding period return was                         percent   The money weighted rate of return which we calculated as      percent puts a greater weight  on the second year s relatively poor performance       percent  than the first year s relatively  good performance     percent  as more money was invested in the second year than in the first   That is the sense in which returns in this method of calculating performance are  money  weighted  
5,409,As a tool for evaluating investment managers the money weighted rate of return has a serious  drawback  Generally the investment manager s clients determine when money is given to the  investment manager and how much money is given  As we have seen those decisions may  significantly influence the investment manager s money weighted rate of return  A general  principle of evaluation however is that a person or entity should be judged only on the basis of  their own actions or actions under their control  An evaluation tool should isolate the effects of  the investment manager s actions  The next section presents a tool that is effective in that  respect 
6,409,     Time Weighted Rate of Return
7,409,An investment measure that is not sensitive to the additions and withdrawals of funds is the  time weighted rate of return  In the investment management industry the time weighted rate of  return is the preferred performance measure  The time weighted rate of return measures the  compound rate of growth of    initially invested in the portfolio over a stated measurement  period  In contrast to the money weighted rate of return the time weighted rate of return is not  affected by cash withdrawals or additions to the portfolio  The term  time weighted  refers to  the fact that returns are averaged over time  To compute an exact time weighted rate of return  on a portfolio take the following three steps 
8,409,   Price the portfolio immediately prior to any significant addition or withdrawal of funds   Break the overall evaluation period into subperiods based on the dates of cash inflows  and outflows

2,410,   Calculate the holding period return on the portfolio for each subperiod 
3,410,   Link or compound holding period returns to obtain an annual rate of return for the year   the time weighted rate of return for the year   If the investment is for more than one year  take the geometric mean of the annual returns to obtain the time weighted rate of return  over that measurement period 
4,410,Let us return to our money weighted example and calculate the time weighted rate of return for  that investor s portfolio  In that example we computed the holding period returns on the  portfolio Step   in the procedure for finding the time weighted rate of return  Given that the  portfolio earned returns of    percent during the first year and      percent during the second  year what is the portfolio s time weighted rate of return over an evaluation period of two  years 
5,410,We find this time weighted return by taking the geometric mean of the two holding period  returns Step   in the procedure above  The calculation of the geometric mean exactly mirrors  the calculation of a compound growth rate  Here we take the product of   plus the holding  period return for each period to find the terminal value at t     of    invested at t      We then  take the square root of this product and subtract   to get the geometric mean  We interpret the  result as the annual compound growth rate of    invested in the portfolio at t      Thus we have
6,410,     Time weighted return                     Time weighted return                                
7,410,The time weighted return on the portfolio was       percent compared with the money  weighted return of      percent which gave larger weight to the second year s return  We can  see why investment managers find time weighted returns more meaningful  If a client gives an  investment manager more funds to invest at an unfavorable time the manager s money  weighted rate of return will tend to be depressed  If a client adds funds at a favorable time the  money weighted return will tend to be elevated  The time weighted rate of return removes these  effects 
8,410,In defining the steps to calculate an exact time weighted rate of return we said that the portfolio  should be valued immediately prior to any significant addition or withdrawal of funds  With the  amount of cash flow activity in many portfolios this task can be costly  We can often obtain a  reasonable approximation of the time weighted rate of return by valuing the portfolio at  frequent regular intervals particularly if additions and withdrawals are unrelated to market  movements  The more frequent the valuation the more accurate the approximation  Daily  valuation is commonplace  Suppose that a portfolio is valued daily over the course of a year  To  compute the time weighted return for the year we first compute each day s holding period  return 
9,410,rt  
10,410,MVEt   MVBt MVBt
11,410,where MVBt equals the market value at the beginning of day t and MVEt equals the market  value at the end of day t  We compute     such daily returns denoted r  r    r     We obtain  the annual return for the year by linking the daily holding period returns in the following way        r          r              r          If withdrawals and additions to the portfolio happen only  at day s end this annual return is a precise time weighted rate of return for the year  Otherwise  it is an approximate time weighted return for the year

2,415,Solution to   
3,415,In this example the time weighted return        percent  is greater than the money  weighted return     percent   The Walbright Fund s performance was relatively poorer  during the eight month period when the fund owned more shares than it was overall   This fact is reflected in a lower money weighted rate of return compared with time  weighted rate of return as the money weighted return is sensitive to the timing and  amount of withdrawals and additions to the portfolio 
4,415,The accurate measurement of portfolio returns is important to the process of evaluating  portfolio managers  In addition to considering returns however analysts must also weigh risk   When we worked through Example   we stopped short of suggesting that in house  management was superior to Super Trust because it earned a higher time weighted rate of  return  With risk in focus we can talk of risk adjusted performance and make  comparisons but only cautiously  In other readings we will discuss the Sharpe ratio an  important risk adjusted performance measure that we might apply to an investment manager s  time weighted rate of return  For now we have illustrated the major tools for measuring the  return on a portfolio 
5,415,   MONEY MARKET YIELDS
6,415,In our discussion of internal rate of return and net present value we referred to the opportunity  cost of capital as a market determined rate  In this section we begin a discussion of discounted  cash flow analysis in actual markets by considering short term debt markets 
7,415,To understand the various ways returns are presented in debt markets we must discuss some of  the conventions for quoting yields on money market instruments  The money market is the  market for short term debt instruments  one year maturity or less   Some instruments require  the issuer to repay the lender the amount borrowed plus interest  Others are pure discount  instruments that pay interest as the difference between the amount borrowed and the amount  paid back 
8,415,In the US money market the classic example of a pure discount instrument is the US Treasury  bill  T bill  issued by the federal government  The face value of a T bill is the amount the US  government promises to pay back to a T bill investor  In buying a T bill investors pay the face  amount less the discount and receive the face amount at maturity  The discount is the  reduction from the face amount that gives the price for the T bill  This discount becomes the  interest that accumulates because the investor receives the face amount at maturity  Thus  investors earn a dollar return equal to the discount if they hold the instrument to maturity   T bills are by far the most important class of money market instruments in the United States   Other types of money market instruments include commercial paper and bankers  acceptances  which are discount instruments and negotiable certificates of deposit which are interest  bearing instruments  The market for each of these instruments has its own convention for  quoting prices or yields  The remainder of this section examines the quoting conventions for  T bills and other money market instruments  In most instances the quoted yields must be  adjusted for use in other present value problems

2,416,Pure discount instruments such as T bills are quoted differently from US government bonds   T bills are quoted on a bank discount basis rather than on a price basis  The bank discount  basis is a quoting convention that annualizes based on a     day year the discount as a  percentage of face value  Yield on a bank discount basis is computed as follows 
3,416,Equation

13,416,t   the actual number of days remaining to maturity
14,416,      bank convention of the number of days in a year
15,416,The bank discount yield  often called simply the discount yield  takes the dollar discount from  par D and expresses it as a fraction of the face value  not the price  of the T bill  This fraction  is then multiplied by the number of periods of length t in one year  that is     t  where the  year is assumed to have     days  Annualizing in this fashion assumes simple interest  no  compounding   Consider the following example 
16,416,EXAMPLE  
17,416,The Bank Discount Yield
18,416,Suppose a T bill with a face value  or par value  of         and     days until  maturity is selling for         What is its bank discount yield 
19,416,Solution 
20,416,For this example the dollar discount D is        The yield on a bank discount basis is      percent as computed with Equation   
21,416,rBD  
22,416,             
23,416,       
24,416,      
25,416,The bank discount formula takes the T bill s dollar discount from face or par as a  fraction of face value   percent and then annualizes by the factor                The  price of discount instruments such as T bills is quoted using discount yields so we  typically translate discount yield into price 
26,416,Suppose we know the bank discount yield of     percent but do not know the price  We  solve for the dollar discount D as follows

3,417,t
4,417,   
5,417,With rBD       percent the dollar discount is D                                       Once we have computed the dollar discount the purchase price for the T bill is its face  value minus the dollar discount F   D                            
6,417,Yield on a bank discount basis is not a meaningful measure of investors  return for three  reasons  First the yield is based on the face value of the bond not on its purchase price  Returns  from investments should be evaluated relative to the amount that is invested  Second the yield  is annualized based on a     day year rather than a     day year  Third the bank discount yield  annualizes with simple interest which ignores the opportunity to earn interest on interest   compound interest  
7,417,We can extend Example   to discuss three often used alternative yield measures  The first is the  holding period return over the remaining life of the instrument      days in the case of the  T bill in Example     It determines the return that an investor will earn by holding the  instrument to maturity  as used here this measure refers to an unannualized rate of return  or  periodic rate of return   In fixed income markets this holding period return is also called a  holding period yield  HPY     For an instrument that makes one cash payment during its life  HPY is
8,417,Equation    
9,417,where
10,417,HPY  
11,417,P    P    D  P 
12,417,P    the initial purchase price of the instrument
13,417,P    the price received for the instrument at its maturity
14,417,D    the cash distribution paid by the instrument at its maturity  i e  interest 
15,417,When we use this expression to calculate the holding period yield for an interest bearing  instrument  for example coupon bearing bonds  we need to observe an important detail  The  purchase and sale prices must include any accrued interest added to the trade price because  the bond was traded between interest payment dates  Accrued interest is the coupon interest that  the seller earns from the last coupon date but does not receive as a coupon because the next  coupon date occurs after the date of sale

2,418,For pure discount securities all of the return is derived by redeeming the bill for more than its  purchase price  Because the T bill is a pure discount instrument it makes no interest payment  and thus D       Therefore the holding period yield is the dollar discount divided by the  purchase price HPY   D P  where D   P    P   The holding period yield is the amount that is  annualized in the other measures  For the T bill in Example   the investment of        will  pay         in     days  The holding period yield on this investment using Equation   is                                                    percent  For this example the  periodic return of        percent is associated with a     day period  If we were to use the  T bill rate of return as the opportunity cost of investing we would use a discount rate of         percent for the     day T bill to find the present value of any other cash flow to be received in      days  As long as the other cash flow has risk characteristics similar to those of the T bill  this approach is appropriate  If the other cash flow were riskier than the T bill then we could  use the T bill s yield as a base rate to which we would add a risk premium  The formula for the  holding period yield is the same regardless of the currency of denomination 
3,418,The second measure of yield is the effective annual yield  EAY   The EAY takes the quantity    plus the holding period yield and compounds it forward to one year then subtracts   to  recover an annualized return that accounts for the effect of interest on interest   
4,418,Equation    
5,418,In our example we can solve for EAY as follows 
6,418,EAY        HPY     t    
7,418,EAY                                                 
8,418,This example illustrates a general rule  The bank discount yield is less than the effective annual  yield 
9,418,The third alternative measure of yield is the money market yield  also known as the CD  equivalent yield   This convention makes the quoted yield on a T bill comparable to yield  quotations on interest bearing money market instruments that pay interest on a     day basis   In general the money market yield is equal to the annualized holding period yield  assuming a      day year rMM    HPY      t   Compared to the bank discount yield the money market  yield is computed on the purchase price so rMM    rBD  F P    This equation shows that the  money market yield is larger than the bank discount yield  In practice the following expression  is more useful because it does not require knowing the T bill price 
10,418,Equation    
11,418,rMM  
12,418,   rBD        t   rBD  
13,418,For the T bill example the money market yield is rMM                                              percent

10,419,The next example will help you consolidate your knowledge of these yield measures 
11,419,EXAMPLE  
12,419,Using the Appropriate Discount Rate
13,419,You need to find the present value of a cash flow of       that is to be received in      days  You decide to look at a T bill maturing in     days to determine the relevant  interest rate for calculating the present value  You have found a variety of yields for the      day bill  Table   presents this information 
14,419,Table    Short Term Money Market Yields
15,419,Holding period yield         Bank discount yield      Money market yield        Effective annual yield        
16,419,Which yield or yields are appropriate for finding the present value of the       to be  received in     days 
17,419,Solution 
18,419,The holding period yield is appropriate and we can also use the money market yield and  effective annual yield after converting them to a holding period yield 
19,419,  Holding period yield         percent   This yield is exactly what we want   Because it applies to a     day period we can use it in a straightforward fashion  to find the present value of the       to be received in     days   Recall the  principle that discount rates must be compatible with the time period   The present  value is

21,419,              
22,419,         
23,419,Now we can see why the other yield measures are inappropriate or not as easily applied

2,420,  Bank discount yield      percent   We should not use this yield measure to  determine the present value of the cash flow  As mentioned earlier the bank  discount yield is based on the face value of the bill and not on its price 
3,420,  Money market yield        percent   To use the money market yield we need to  convert it to the     day holding period yield by dividing it by            After  obtaining the holding period yield                              we use it to  discount the       as above 
4,420,  Effective annual yield         percent   This yield has also been annualized so it  must be adjusted to be compatible with the timing of the cash flow  We can obtain  the holding period yield from the EAY as follows 
5,420,                                
6,420,Recall that when we found the effective annual yield the exponent was         or the  number of     day periods in a     day year  To shrink the effective annual yield to a      day yield we use the reciprocal of the exponent that we used to annualize 
7,420,In Example   we converted two short term measures of annual yield to a holding period yield  for a     day period  That is one type of conversion  We frequently also need to convert  periodic rates to annual rates  The issue can arise both in money markets and in longer term  debt markets  As an example many bonds  long term debt instruments  pay interest  semiannually  Bond investors compute IRRs for bonds known as yields to maturity  YTM   If  the semiannual yield to maturity is   percent how do we annualize it  An exact approach  taking account of compounding would be to compute                      or      percent  This  is what we have been calling an effective annual yield  An approach used in US bond markets  however is to double the semiannual YTM               The yield to maturity calculated this  way ignoring compounding has been called a bond equivalent yield  Annualizing a  semiannual yield by doubling is putting the yield on a bond equivalent basis  In practice the  result   percent would be referred to simply as the bond s yield to maturity  In money markets  if we annualized a six month period yield by doubling it in order to make the result comparable  to bonds  YTMs we would also say that the result was a bond equivalent yield 
8,420,SUMMARY
9,420,In this reading we applied the concepts of present value net present value and internal rate of  return to the fundamental problem of valuing investments  We applied these concepts first to  corporate investment the well known capital budgeting problem  We then examined the  fundamental problem of calculating the return on a portfolio subject to cash inflows and  outflows  Finally we discussed money market yields and basic bond market terminology  The  following summarizes the reading s key concepts

2,421,  The net present value  NPV  of a project is the present value of its cash inflows minus the  present value of its cash outflows  The internal rate of return  IRR  is the discount rate  that makes NPV equal to    We can interpret IRR as an expected compound return only  when all interim cash flows can be reinvested at the internal rate of return and the  investment is maintained to maturity 
3,421,  The NPV rule for decision making is to accept all projects with positive NPV or if  projects are mutually exclusive to accept the project with the higher positive NPV  With  mutually exclusive projects we rely on the NPV rule  The IRR rule is to accept all  projects with an internal rate of return exceeding the required rate of return  The IRR rule  can be affected by problems of scale and timing of cash flows 
4,421,  Money weighted rate of return and time weighted rate of return are two alternative  methods for calculating portfolio returns in a multiperiod setting when the portfolio is  subject to additions and withdrawals  Time weighted rate of return is the standard in the  investment management industry  Money weighted rate of return can be appropriate if the  investor exercises control over additions and withdrawals to the portfolio 
5,421,  The money weighted rate of return is the internal rate of return on a portfolio taking  account of all cash flows 
6,421,  The time weighted rate of return removes the effects of timing and amount of  withdrawals and additions to the portfolio and reflects the compound rate of growth of  one unit of currency invested over a stated measurement period 
7,421,  The bank discount yield for US Treasury bills  and other money market instruments sold  on a discount basis  is given by rBD    F   P   F       t   D F       t where F is the  face amount to be received at maturity P  is the price of the Treasury bill t is the number  of days to maturity and D is the dollar discount

9,421,  The effective annual yield  EAY  is      HPY     t     
10,421,  The money market yield is given by rMM   HPY       t where t is the number of days to  maturity 
11,421,  For a Treasury bill money market yield can be obtained from the bank discount yield  using rMM          rBD         t   rBD  
12,421,  We can convert back and forth between holding period yields money market yields and  effective annual yields by using the holding period yield which is common to all the  calculations 
13,421,  The bond equivalent yield of a yield stated on a semiannual basis is that yield multiplied  by

25,426,   B is correct  According to the NPV rule shareholder wealth is maximized by selecting a  project with the highest NPV  The IRR rule also signals acceptance  however the IRR  rule should not be used to rank projects  In this case Project B adds the most value to the  firm 
26,426,   C is correct  The internal rate of return is computed by identifying all cash flows and  solving for the rate that makes the net present value of those cash flows equal to zero 
27,426,   B is correct  IRR is determined by setting the net present value equal to zero for the cash  flows shown in the table

2,427,   B is correct  The projects are mutually exclusive because the amount to invest is  constrained to           Therefore the net present value  NPV  rule should be used to  choose among them when the IRR rule and NPV rule conflict  Based on the opportunity  cost of capital of     the NPV of Project B is         which is higher than the NPV  of        for Project A and the NPV of         for Project C

20,427,results in a value of r        
21,427,    C is correct  The money weighted rate of return considers both the timing and amounts of  investments into the fund  The investment at the beginning of Year   will be worth                                     at the end of Year    The investment made at the  beginning of Year   will be worth                              at the end of Year     The investment of        at the beginning of Year   decreases to a value of                        at the end of Year

5,429,NOTES
6,429, In developing cash flow estimates we observe two principles  First we include only the incremental cash  flows resulting from undertaking the project  we do not include sunk costs  costs that have been committed prior  to the project   Second we account for tax effects by using after tax cash flows  For a full discussion of these and  other issues in capital budgeting see Brealey Myers and Allen        
7,429, The weighted average cost of capital  WACC  is often used to discount cash flows  This value is a weighted  average of the after tax required rates of return on the company s common stock preferred stock and long term  debt where the weights are the fraction of each source of financing in the company s target capital structure  For a  full discussion of the issues surrounding the cost of capital see Brealey Myers and Allen        
8,429, In some real world capital budgeting problems the initial investment  which has a minus sign  may be followed  by subsequent cash inflows  which have plus signs  and outflows  which have minus signs   In these instances the  project can have more than one IRR  The possibility of multiple solutions is a theoretical limitation of IRR 
9,429, Or suppose the two projects require the same physical or other resources so that only one can be undertaken 
10,429, The ending amount                         differs from the        amount listed in Table   because we  rounded IRR 
11,429, There is a crossover discount rate above which Project A has a higher NPV than Project D  This crossover rate is        percent 
12,429, Technically different reinvestment rate assumptions account for this conflict between the IRR and NPV rules   The IRR rule assumes that the company can earn the IRR on all reinvested cash flows but the NPV rule assumes  that cash flows are reinvested at the company s opportunity cost of capital  The NPV assumption is far more  realistic  For further details on this and other topics in capital budgeting see Brealey Myers and Allen        
13,429, The term  performance evaluation  has been used as a synonym for performance appraisal 
14,429, In the United States the money weighted return is frequently called the dollar weighted return  We follow a  standard presentation of the money weighted return as an IRR concept 
15,429,  In this particular case we could solve for r by solving the quadratic equation    x       x           with x           r  using standard results from algebra  In general however we rely on a calculator or spreadsheet software to  compute a money weighted rate of return 
16,429,  Note that the calculator or spreadsheet will give the IRR as a periodic rate  If the periods are not annual we  annualize the periodic rate 
17,429,  By convention we denote outflow with a negative sign and we need   as a placeholder for the t     
18,429,  Bond market participants often use the term  yield  when referring to total returns  returns incorporating both  price change and income  as in yield to maturity  In other cases yield refers to returns from income alone  as in  current yield which is annual interest divided by price   As used in this volume and by many writers holding  period yield is a bond market synonym for holding period return total return and horizon return

2,430,  The price with accrued interest is called the full price  Trade prices are quoted  clean   without accrued  interest  but accrued interest if any is added to the purchase price  For more on accrued interest see the Level I  CFA Program curriculum reading  Understanding Fixed Income Risk and Return  
3,430,  Effective annual yield was called the effective annual rate  Equation    in the reading on the time value of  money 
4,430,  Some national markets use the money market yield formula rather than the bank discount yield formula to  quote the yields on discount instruments such as T bills  In Canada the convention is to quote Treasury bill yields  using the money market formula assuming a     day year  Yields for German Treasury discount paper with a  maturity less than one year and French BTFs  T bills  are computed with the money market formula assuming a      day year

2,432,Statistical methods provide a powerful set of tools for analyzing data and drawing conclusions from them  Whether we  are analyzing asset returns earnings growth rates commodity prices or any other financial data statistical tools help us  quantify and communicate the data s important features  This reading presents the basics of describing and analyzing  data the branch of statistics known as descriptive statistics  The reading supplies a set of useful concepts and tools  illustrated in a variety of investment contexts  One theme of our presentation reflected in the reading s title is the  demonstration of the statistical methods that allow us to summarize return distributions   We explore four properties of  return distributions 
3,432,  where the returns are centered  central tendency  
4,432,  how far returns are dispersed from their center  dispersion  
5,432,  whether the distribution of returns is symmetrically shaped or lopsided  skewness   and
6,432,  whether extreme outcomes are likely  kurtosis  
7,432,These same concepts are generally applicable to the distributions of other types of data too 
8,432,The reading is organized as follows  After defining some basic concepts in Section   in Sections   and   we discuss the  presentation of data  Section   describes the organization of data in a table format and Section   describes the graphic  presentation of data  We then turn to the quantitative description of how data are distributed  Section   focuses on  measures that quantify where data are centered or measures of central tendency  Section   presents other measures that  describe the location of data  Section   presents measures that quantify the degree to which data are dispersed  Sections    and   describe additional measures that provide a more accurate picture of data  Section    provides investment  applications of concepts introduced in Section   
9,432,   SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
10,432,Before starting the study of statistics with this reading it may be helpful to examine a picture of the overall field  In the  following we briefly describe the scope of statistics and its branches of study  We explain the concepts of population and  sample  Data come in a variety of types affecting the ways they can be measured and the appropriate statistical methods  for analyzing them  We conclude by discussing the basic types of data measurement 
11,432,     The Nature of Statistics
12,432,The term statistics can have two broad meanings one referring to data and the other to method  A company s average  earnings per share  EPS  for the last    quarters or its average returns for the past    years are statistics  We may also  analyze historical EPS to forecast future EPS or use the company s past returns to infer its risk  The totality of methods  we employ to collect and analyze data is also called statistics 
13,432,Statistical methods include descriptive statistics and statistical inference  inferential statistics   Descriptive statistics is  the study of how data can be summarized effectively to describe the important aspects of large data sets  By  consolidating a mass of numerical details descriptive statistics turns data into information  Statistical inference involves making forecasts estimates or judgments about a larger group from the smaller group actually observed  The  foundation for statistical inference is probability theory and both statistical inference and probability theory will be  discussed in later readings  Our focus in this reading is solely on descriptive statistics 
14,432,     Populations and Samples
15,432,Throughout the study of statistics we make a critical distinction between a population and a sample  In this section we  explain these two terms as well as the related terms  parameter  and  sample statistic   
16,432,  Definition of Population  A population is defined as all members of a specified group 
17,432,Any descriptive measure of a population characteristic is called a parameter  Although a population can have many  parameters investment analysts are usually concerned with only a few such as the mean value the range of investment  returns and the variance

2,433,Even if it is possible to observe all the members of a population it is often too expensive in terms of time or money to  attempt to do so  For example if the population is all telecommunications customers worldwide and an analyst is  interested in their purchasing plans she will find it too costly to observe the entire population  The analyst can address  this situation by taking a sample of the population 
3,433,  Definition of Sample  A sample is a subset of a population 
4,433,In taking a sample the analyst hopes it is characteristic of the population  The field of statistics known as sampling deals  with taking samples in appropriate ways to achieve the objective of representing the population well  A later reading  addresses the details of sampling 
5,433,Earlier we mentioned statistics in the sense of referring to data  Just as a parameter is a descriptive measure of a  population characteristic a sample statistic  statistic for short  is a descriptive measure of a sample characteristic 
6,433,  Definition of Sample Statistic  A sample statistic  or statistic  is a quantity computed from or used to describe  a sample 
7,433,We devote much of this reading to explaining and illustrating the use of statistics in this sense  The concept is critical  also in statistical inference which addresses such problems as estimating an unknown population parameter using a  sample statistic 
8,433,     Measurement Scales
9,433,To choose the appropriate statistical methods for summarizing and analyzing data we need to distinguish among  different measurement scales or levels of measurement  All data measurements are taken on one of four major scales   nominal ordinal interval or ratio 
10,433,Nominal scales represent the weakest level of measurement  They categorize data but do not rank them  If we assigned  integers to mutual funds that follow different investment strategies the number   might refer to a small cap value fund  the number   to a large cap value fund and so on for each possible style  This nominal scale categorizes the funds  according to their style but does not rank them 
11,433,Ordinal scales reflect a stronger level of measurement  Ordinal scales sort data into categories that are ordered with  respect to some characteristic  For example the Morningstar and Standard   Poor s star ratings for mutual funds  represent an ordinal scale in which one star represents a group of funds judged to have had relatively the worst  performance with two three four and five stars representing groups with increasingly better performance as evaluated  by those services 
12,433,An ordinal scale may also involve numbers to identify categories  For example in ranking balanced mutual funds based  on their five year cumulative return we might assign the number   to the top    percent of funds and so on so that the  number    represents the bottom    percent of funds  The ordinal scale is stronger than the nominal scale because it  reveals that a fund ranked   performed better than a fund ranked    The scale tells us nothing however about the  difference in performance between funds ranked   and   compared with the difference in performance between funds  ranked   and   or   and    
13,433,Interval scales provide not only ranking but also assurance that the differences between scale values are equal  As a  result scale values can be added and subtracted meaningfully  The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are interval  measurement scales  The difference in temperature between    C and    C is the same amount as the difference between     C and    C  We can state accurately that    C     C     C for example  Nevertheless the zero point of an interval  scale does not reflect complete absence of what is being measured  it is not a true zero point or natural zero  Zero degrees  Celsius corresponds to the freezing point of water not the absence of temperature  As a consequence of the absence of a  true zero point we cannot meaningfully form ratios on interval scales 
14,433,As an example    C although five times as large a number as    C does not represent five times as much temperature   Also questionnaire scales are often treated as interval scales  If an investor is asked to rank his risk aversion on a scale  from    extremely risk averse  to    extremely risk loving  the difference between a response of   and a response of   is  sometimes assumed to represent the same difference in risk aversion as the difference between a response of   and a  response of    When that assumption can be justified the data are measured on an interval scale 
15,433,Ratio scales represent the strongest level of measurement  They have all the characteristics of interval measurement  scales as well as a true zero point as the origin  With ratio scales we can meaningfully compute ratios as well as  meaningfully add and subtract amounts within the scale  As a result we can apply the widest range of statistical tools to  data measured on a ratio scale  Rates of return are measured on a ratio scale as is money  If we have twice as much  money then we have twice the purchasing power  Note that the scale has a natural zero zero means no money 
16,433,Now that we have addressed the important preliminaries we can discuss summarizing and describing data

2,434,EXAMPLE  
3,434,Identifying Scales of Measurement
4,434,State the scale of measurement for each of the following 
5,434,   Credit ratings for bond issues  
6,434,   Cash dividends per share 
7,434,   Hedge fund classification types  
8,434,   Bond maturity in years 
9,434,Solution to   
10,434,Credit ratings are measured on an ordinal scale  A rating places a bond issue in a category and the categories are  ordered with respect to the expected probability of default  But the difference in the expected probability of  default between AA  and A  for example is not necessarily equal to that between BB  and B   In other words  letter credit ratings are not measured on an interval scale 
11,434,Solution to   
12,434,Cash dividends per share are measured on a ratio scale  For this variable   represents the complete absence of  dividends  it is a true zero point 
13,434,Solution to   
14,434,Hedge fund classification types are measured on a nominal scale  Each type groups together hedge funds with  similar investment strategies  In contrast to credit ratings for bonds however hedge fund classification schemes  do not involve a ranking  Thus such classification schemes are not measured on an ordinal scale 
15,434,Solution to   
16,434,Bond maturity is measured on a ratio scale 
17,434,   SUMMARIZING DATA USING FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
18,434,In this section we discuss one of the simplest ways to summarize data the frequency distribution 
19,434,  Definition of Frequency Distribution  A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data summarized into a  relatively small number of intervals 
20,434,Frequency distributions help in the analysis of large amounts of statistical data and they work with all types of  measurement scales 
21,434,Rates of return are the fundamental units that analysts and portfolio managers use for making investment decisions and  we can use frequency distributions to summarize rates of return  When we analyze rates of return our starting point is the  holding period return  also called the total return  
22,434,  Holding Period Return Formula  The holding period return for time period t Rt is
23,434,Equation    
24,434,Rt  
25,434,Pt   Pt     Dt
26,434,Pt

2,435,where
3,435,Pt   price per share at the end of time period t
4,435,Pt     price per share at the end of time period t     the time period immediately preceding time period t
5,435,Dt   cash distributions received during time period t
6,435,Thus the holding period return for time period t is the capital gain  or loss  plus distributions divided by the beginning  period price   For common stocks the distribution is a dividend  for bonds the distribution is a coupon payment    Equation   can be used to define the holding period return on any asset for a day week month or year simply by  changing the interpretation of the time interval between successive values of the time index t 
7,435,The holding period return as defined in Equation   has two important characteristics  First it has an element of time  attached to it  For example if a monthly time interval is used between successive observations for price then the rate of  return is a monthly figure  Second rate of return has no currency unit attached to it  For instance suppose that prices are  denominated in euros  The numerator and denominator of Equation   would be expressed in euros and the resulting  ratio would not have any units because the units in the numerator and denominator would cancel one another  This result  holds regardless of the currency in which prices are denominated  
8,435,With these concerns noted we now turn to the frequency distribution of the holding period returns on the S P      Index   First we examine annual rates of return  then we look at monthly rates of return  The annual rates of return on  the S P     calculated with Equation   span the period January      to December      for a total of    annual  observations  Monthly return data cover the period January      to December      for a total of      monthly  observations 
9,435,We can state a basic procedure for constructing a frequency distribution as follows 
10,435,Construction of a Frequency Distribution 
11,435,   Sort the data in ascending order 
12,435,   Calculate the range of the data defined as Range   Maximum value   Minimum value 
13,435,   Decide on the number of intervals in the frequency distribution k 
14,435,   Determine interval width as Range k 
15,435,   Determine the intervals by successively adding the interval width to the minimum value to determine the ending  points of intervals stopping after reaching an interval that includes the maximum value 
16,435,   Count the number of observations falling in each interval 
17,435,   Construct a table of the intervals listed from smallest to largest that shows the number of observations falling in  each interval 
18,435,In Step   when rounding the interval width round up rather than down to ensure that the final interval includes the  maximum value of the data 
19,435,As the above procedure makes clear a frequency distribution groups data into a set of intervals   An interval is a set of  values within which an observation falls  Each observation falls into only one interval and the total number of intervals  covers all the values represented in the data  The actual number of observations in a given interval is called the absolute  frequency or simply the frequency  The frequency distribution is the list of intervals together with the corresponding  measures of frequency 
20,435,To illustrate the basic procedure suppose we have    observations sorted in ascending order                                                             and        The minimum observation is       and the maximum observation is         so the range is                        If we set k     the interval width is           Table   shows the repeated  addition of the interval width of   to determine the endpoints for the intervals  Step    
21,435,Table    Endpoints of Intervals

2,436,        
3,436,                            
4,436,Thus the intervals are        to               to             to       and       to          Table   summarizes Steps    through

8,436,Absolute Frequency        
9,436,Note that the intervals do not overlap so each observation can be placed uniquely into one interval 
10,436,In practice we may want to refine the above basic procedure  For example we may want the intervals to begin and end  with whole numbers for ease of interpretation  We also need to explain the choice of the number of intervals k  We turn  to these issues in discussing the construction of frequency distributions for the S P     
11,436,We first consider the case of constructing a frequency distribution for the annual returns on the S P     over the period       to       During that period the return on the S P     had a minimum value of        percent  in       and a  maximum value of        percent  in        Thus the range of the data was                     approximately  The  question now is the number k of intervals into which we should group observations  Although some guidelines for setting  k have been suggested in statistical literature the setting of a useful value for k often involves inspecting the data and  exercising judgment  How much detail should we include  If we use too few intervals we will summarize too much and  lose pertinent characteristics  If we use too many intervals we may not summarize enough 
12,436,We can establish an appropriate value for k by evaluating the usefulness of the resulting interval width  A large number  of empty intervals may indicate that we are trying to organize the data to present too much detail  Starting with a  relatively small interval width we can see whether or not the intervals are mostly empty and whether or not the value of  k associated with that interval width is too large  If intervals are mostly empty or k is very large we can consider  increasingly larger intervals  smaller values of k  until we have a frequency distribution that effectively summarizes the  distribution  For the annual S P     series return intervals of   percent width would result in    intervals and many of  them would be empty because we have only    annual observations  We need to keep in mind that the purpose of a  frequency distribution is to summarize the data  Suppose that for ease of interpretation we want to use an interval width  stated in whole rather than fractional percents  A   percent interval width would have many fewer empty intervals than a    percent interval width and effectively summarize the data  A   percent interval width would be associated with              intervals which we can round up to    intervals  That number of intervals will cover                We can  confirm that if we start the smallest   percent interval at the whole number       percent the final interval ends at                     and includes the maximum return in the sample       percent  In so constructing the frequency  distribution we will also have intervals that end and begin at a value of   percent allowing us to count the negative and  positive returns in the data  Without too much work we have found an effective way to summarize the data  We will use  return intervals of   percent beginning with        Rt         given as       to       in the table  and ending with        Rt        Table   shows the frequency distribution for the annual total returns on the S P     
13,436,Table   includes three other useful ways to present data which we can compute once we have established the frequency  distribution  the relative frequency the cumulative frequency  also called the cumulative absolute frequency  and the  cumulative relative frequency 
14,436,  Definition of Relative Frequency  The relative frequency is the absolute frequency of each interval divided by  the total number of observations

16,436,         
1,437,The cumulative relative frequency cumulates  adds up  the relative frequencies as we move from the first to the last  interval  It tells us the fraction of observations that are less than the upper limit of each interval  Examining the frequency  distribution given in Table   we see that the first return interval     percent to     percent has one observation  its  relative frequency is      or      percent  The cumulative frequency for this interval is   because only one observation is  less than     percent  The cumulative relative frequency is thus      or      percent  The next return interval has zero  observations  therefore its cumulative frequency is   plus   and its cumulative relative frequency is      percent  the  cumulative relative frequency from the previous interval   We can find the other cumulative frequencies by adding the   absolute  frequency to the previous cumulative frequency  The cumulative frequency then tells us the number of  observations that are less than the upper limit of each return interval

2,438,As Table   shows return intervals have frequencies from   to   in this sample  The interval encompassing returns  between     percent and    percent         Rt        has the most observations seven  Next most frequent are returns  between   percent and   percent       Rt       and between   percent and    percent        Rt        with six  observations in each interval  From the cumulative frequency column we see that the number of negative returns is      The number of positive returns must then be equal to         or     We can express the number of positive and negative  outcomes as a percentage of the total to get a sense of the risk inherent in investing in the stock market  During the     year period the S P     had negative annual returns      percent of the time  that is         This result appears in the  fifth column of Table   which reports the cumulative relative frequency 
3,438,The frequency distribution gives us a sense of not only where most of the observations lie but also whether the  distribution is evenly distributed lopsided or otherwise distinctive  In the case of the S P     we can see that more  than half of the outcomes are positive and most of those annual returns are larger than    percent   Only    of the     positive annual returns about    percent were between   and    percent  
4,438,Table   permits us to make an important further point about the choice of the number of intervals related to equity  returns in particular  From the frequency distribution in Table   we can see that only six outcomes fall between      percent to     percent and only five outcomes fall between    percent to    percent  Stock return data are frequently  characterized by a few very large or small outcomes  We could have collapsed the return intervals in the tails of the  frequency distribution by choosing a smaller value of k but then we would have lost the information about how  extremely poorly or well the stock market had performed  A risk manager may need to know the worst possible outcomes  and thus may want to have detailed information on the tails  the extreme values   A frequency distribution with a  relatively large value of k is useful for that  A portfolio manager or analyst may be equally interested in detailed  information on the tails  however if the manager or analyst wants a picture only of where most of the observations lie he  might prefer to use an interval width of   percent     intervals beginning at     percent  for example 
5,438,The frequency distribution for monthly returns on the S P     looks quite different from that for annual returns  The  monthly return series from January      to December      has      observations  Returns range from a minimum of  approximately     percent to a maximum of approximately     percent  With such a large quantity of monthly data we  must summarize to get a sense of the distribution and so we group the data into    equally spaced return intervals of    percent  The gains from summarizing in this way are substantial  Table   presents the resulting frequency distribution   The absolute frequencies appear in the second column followed by the relative frequencies  The relative frequencies are  rounded to two decimal places  The cumulative absolute and cumulative relative frequencies appear in the fourth and  fifth columns respectively

29,439,The advantage of a frequency distribution is evident in Table   which tells us that the vast majority of observations                 percent  lie in the four intervals spanning    percent to    percent  Altogether we have     negative  returns and     positive returns  Almost    percent of the monthly outcomes are positive  Looking at the cumulative  relative frequency in the last column we see that the interval    percent to   percent shows a cumulative frequency of        percent for an upper return limit of   percent  This means that       percent of the observations lie below the level  of   percent  We can also see that not many observations are greater than     percent or less than     percent  Note that  the frequency distributions of annual and monthly returns are not directly comparable  On average we should expect the  returns measured at shorter intervals  for example months  to be smaller than returns measured over longer periods  for  example years  
30,439,Next we construct a frequency distribution of average inflation adjusted returns over           for    major equity  markets

2,440,Constructing a Frequency Distribution
3,440,How have equities rewarded investors in different countries in the long run  To answer this question we could  examine the average annual returns directly   The worth of a nominal level of return depends on changes in the  purchasing power of money however and internationally there have been a variety of experiences with price  inflation  It is preferable therefore to compare the average real or inflation adjusted returns earned by investors  in different countries  Dimson Marsh and Staunton        presented authoritative evidence on asset returns in     countries for the     years            Table   excerpts their findings for average inflation adjusted returns

2,441,As Table   shows there is substantial variation internationally of average real equity returns  More than a quarter  of the observations fall in the     to     percent interval which has a relative frequency of       percent  Either  three or four observations fall in each of the other four intervals 
3,441,   THE GRAPHIC PRESENTATION OF DATA
4,441,A graphical display of data allows us to visualize important characteristics quickly  For example we may see that the  distribution is symmetrically shaped and this finding may influence which probability distribution we use to describe the  data  In this section we discuss the histogram the frequency polygon and the cumulative frequency distribution as  methods for displaying data graphically  We construct all of these graphic presentations with the information contained  in the frequency distribution of the S P     shown in either Table   or Table   
5,441,     The Histogram
6,441,A histogram is the graphical equivalent of a frequency distribution 
7,441,  Definition of Histogram  A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped into a frequency distribution 
8,441,The advantage of the visual display is that we can see quickly where most of the observations lie  To see how a  histogram is constructed look at the return interval       Rt       in Table    This interval has an absolute frequency  of    Therefore we erect a bar or rectangle with a height of   over that return interval on the horizontal axis  Continuing  with this process for all other return intervals yields a histogram  Figure   presents the histogram of the annual total  return series on the S P     from      to

5,442,In the histogram in Figure   the height of each bar represents the absolute frequency for each return interval  The return  interval        Rt       has a frequency of   and is represented by the tallest bar in the histogram  Because there are  no gaps between the interval limits there are no gaps between the bars of the histogram  Many of the return intervals  have zero frequency  therefore they have no height in the histogram 
6,442,Figure   presents the histogram for the distribution of monthly returns on the S P      Somewhat more symmetrically  shaped than the histogram of annual returns shown in Figure   this histogram also appears more bell shaped than the  distribution of annual returns

4,443,     The Frequency Polygon and the Cumulative Frequency Distribution
5,443,Two other graphical tools for displaying data are the frequency polygon and the cumulative frequency distribution  To  construct a frequency polygon we plot the midpoint of each interval on the x axis and the absolute frequency for that  interval on the y axis  we then connect neighboring points with a straight line  Figure   shows the frequency polygon for  the      monthly returns for the S P     from January      to December

3,444,In Figure   we have replaced the bars in the histogram with points connected with straight lines  For example the return  interval   percent to   percent has an absolute frequency of      In the frequency polygon we plot the return interval  midpoint of   percent and a frequency of      We plot all other points in a similar way    This form of visual display  adds a degree of continuity to the representation of the distribution 
4,444,Another form of line graph is the cumulative frequency distribution  Such a graph can plot either the cumulative absolute  or cumulative relative frequency against the upper interval limit  The cumulative frequency distribution allows us to see  how many or what percent of the observations lie below a certain value  To construct the cumulative frequency  distribution we graph the returns in the fourth or fifth column of Table   against the upper limit of each return interval   Figure   presents a graph of the cumulative absolute distribution for the monthly returns on the S P      Notice that the  cumulative distribution tends to flatten out when returns are extremely negative or extremely positive  The steep slope in  the middle of Figure   reflects the fact that most of the observations lie in the neighborhood of    percent to   percent

3,445,We can further examine the relationship between the relative frequency and the cumulative relative frequency by looking  at the two return intervals reproduced in Table    The first return interval    percent to   percent  has a cumulative  relative frequency of    percent  The next return interval    percent to   percent  has a cumulative relative frequency of        percent  The change in the cumulative relative frequency as we move from one interval to the next is the next  interval s relative frequency  For instance as we go from the first return interval    percent to   percent  to the next  return interval    percent to   percent  the change in the cumulative relative frequency is                             Values in the table have been rounded to two decimal places   The fact that the slope is steep indicates that these  frequencies are large  As you can see in the graph of the cumulative distribution the slope of the curve changes as we  move from the first return interval to the last  A fairly small slope for the cumulative distribution for the first few return  intervals tells us that these return intervals do not contain many observations  You can go back to the frequency  distribution in Table   and verify that the cumulative absolute frequency is only    observations  the cumulative relative  frequency is      percent  up to the   th return interval      percent to     percent   In essence the slope of the  cumulative absolute distribution at any particular interval is proportional to the number of observations in that interval

2,446,So far we have discussed methods we can use to organize and present data so that they are more understandable  The  frequency distribution of an asset class s return series for example reveals the nature of the risks that investors may  encounter in a particular asset class  As an illustration the histogram for the annual returns on the S P     clearly shows  that large positive and negative annual returns are common  Although frequency distributions and histograms provide a  convenient way to summarize a series of observations these methods are just a first step toward describing the data  In  this section we discuss the use of quantitative measures that explain characteristics of data  Our focus is on measures of  central tendency and other measures of location or location parameters  A measure of central tendency specifies  where the data are centered  Measures of central tendency are probably more widely used than any other statistical  measure because they can be computed and applied easily  Measures of location include not only measures of central  tendency but other measures that illustrate the location or distribution of data 
3,446,In the following subsections we explain the common measures of central tendency the arithmetic mean the median the  mode the weighted mean and the geometric mean  We also explain other useful measures of location including  quartiles quintiles deciles and percentiles 
4,446,     The Arithmetic Mean
5,446,Analysts and portfolio managers often want one number that describes a representative possible outcome of an  investment decision  The arithmetic mean is by far the most frequently used measure of the middle or center of data 
6,446,  Definition of Arithmetic Mean  The arithmetic mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of  observations 
7,446,We can compute the arithmetic mean for both populations and samples known as the population mean and the sample  mean respectively 
8,446,       The Population Mean
9,446,The population mean is the arithmetic mean computed for a population  If we can define a population adequately then  we can calculate the population mean as the arithmetic mean of all the observations or values in the population  For  example analysts examining the fiscal      year over year growth in same store sales of major US wholesale clubs  might define the population of interest to include only three companies  BJ s Wholesale Club  a private company since        Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam s Club part of Wal Mart Stores    As another example if a portfolio  manager s investment universe  the set of securities he or she must choose from  is the Nikkei     Index the relevant  population is the     shares on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange that compose the Nikkei 
10,446,  Population Mean Formula  The population mean   is the arithmetic mean value of a population  For a finite  population the population mean is

12,446,N

14,446,i  
15,446,Xi
16,446,N
17,446,   
18,446,where N is the number of observations in the entire population and Xi is the ith observation 
19,446,The population mean is an example of a parameter  The population mean is unique  that is a given population has only  one mean  To illustrate the calculation we can take the case of the population mean of profit as a percentage of revenue  of US companies running major wholesale clubs for       During the year profit as a percentage of revenue for BJ s  Wholesale club Costco Wholesale Corporation and Wal Mart Stores was     percent     percent and     percent  respectively according to the Fortune     list for       Thus the population mean profit as a percentage of revenue was                                    percent 
20,446,       The Sample Mean
21,446,The sample mean is the arithmetic mean computed for a sample  Many times we cannot observe every member of a set   instead we observe a subset or sample of the population  The concept of the mean can be applied to the observations in a  sample with a slight change in notation 
22,446,  Sample Mean Formula  The sample mean or average    X  read  X bar   is the arithmetic mean value of a  sample

9,447,Equation   tells us to sum the values of the observations  Xi  and divide the sum by the number of observations  For  example if a sample of price to earnings  P E  multiples for six publicly traded companies contains the values                 and    the sample mean P E is             The sample mean is also called the arithmetic average    As we  discussed earlier the sample mean is a statistic  that is a descriptive measure of a sample  
10,447,Means can be computed for individual units or over time  For instance the sample might be the      return on equity   ROE  for the     companies in the FTSE Eurotop     an index of Europe s     largest companies  In this case we  calculate mean ROE in      as an average across     individual units  When we examine the characteristics of some  units at a specific point in time  such as ROE for the FTSE Eurotop      we are examining cross sectional data  The  mean of these observations is called a cross sectional mean  On the other hand if our sample consists of the historical  monthly returns on the FTSE Eurotop     for the past five years then we have time series data  The mean of these  observations is called a time series mean  We will examine specialized statistical methods related to the behavior of time  series in the reading on times series analysis 
11,447,Next we show an example of finding the sample mean return for    European equity markets for       In this case the  mean is cross sectional because we are averaging individual country returns 
12,447,EXAMPLE  
13,447,Calculating a Cross Sectional Mean
14,447,The MSCI EAFE  Europe Australasia and Far East  Index is a free float adjusted market capitalization index  designed to measure developed market equity performance excluding the United States and Canada    As of  September      the EAFE consisted of    developed market indexes including indexes for    European  markets   Australasian markets  Australia and New Zealand    Far Eastern markets  Hong Kong Japan and  Singapore  and Israel

5,448,Using the data in Table   calculate the sample mean return for the    equity markets in

7,448,The calculation applies Equation   to the returns in Table                                                                                                                                                    percent 
8,448,In Example   we can verify that eight markets had returns less than the mean and eight had returns that were greater   We should not expect any of the actual observations to equal the mean because sample means provide only a summary  of the data being analyzed  Also although in this example the number of values below the mean is equal to the number of  values above the mean that need not be the case  As an analyst you will often need to find a few numbers that describe  the characteristics of the distribution  The mean is generally the statistic that you will use as a measure of the typical  outcome for a distribution  You can then use the mean to compare the performance of two different markets  For  example you might be interested in comparing the stock market performance of investments in Pacific Rim countries  with investments in European countries  You can use the mean returns in these markets to compare investment results 
9,448,       Properties of the Arithmetic Mean
10,448,The arithmetic mean can be likened to the center of gravity of an object  Figure   expresses this analogy graphically by  plotting nine hypothetical observations on a bar  The nine observations are                     and     the  arithmetic mean is           The observations are plotted on the bar with various heights based on their frequency  that  is   is one unit high   is two units high and so on   When the bar is placed on a fulcrum it balances only when the  fulcrum is located at the point on the scale that corresponds to the arithmetic mean 
11,448,Figure    Center of Gravity Analogy for the Arithmetic Mean
12,448,As analysts we often use the mean return as a measure of the typical outcome for an asset  As in the example above  however some outcomes are above the mean and some are below it  We can calculate the distance between the mean and  each outcome and call it a deviation  Mathematically it is always true that the sum of the deviations around the mean  equals    We can see this by using the definition of the arithmetic mean shown in Equation   multiplying both sides of  the equation by n  n    X  
13,448,Xi   The sum of the deviations from the mean can thus be calculated as follows

2,449,Deviations from the arithmetic mean are important information because they indicate risk  The concept of deviations  around the mean forms the foundation for the more complex concepts of variance skewness and kurtosis which we will  discuss later in this reading 
3,449,An advantage of the arithmetic mean over two other measures of central tendency the median and mode is that the mean  uses all the information about the size and magnitude of the observations  The mean is also easy to work with  mathematically 
4,449,A property and potential drawback of the arithmetic mean is its sensitivity to extreme values  Because all observations  are used to compute the mean the arithmetic mean can be pulled sharply upward or downward by extremely large or  small observations respectively  For example suppose we compute the arithmetic mean of the following seven numbers               and       The mean is                 or approximately      Because the magnitude of the mean      is so much larger than that of the bulk of the observations  the first six  we might question how well it represents the  location of the data  In practice although an extreme value or outlier in a financial dataset may only represent a rare  value in the population it may also reflect an error in recording the value of an observation or an observation generated  from a different population from that producing the other observations in the sample  In the latter two cases in particular  the arithmetic mean could be misleading  Perhaps the most common approach in such cases is to report the median in  place of or in addition to the mean    We discuss the median next 
5,449,     The Median
6,449,A second important measure of central tendency is the median 
7,449,  Definition of Median  The median is the value of the middle item of a set of items that has been sorted into  ascending or descending order  In an odd numbered sample of n items the median occupies the  n        position   In an even numbered sample we define the median as the mean of the values of items occupying the n   and  n         positions  the two middle items    
8,449,Earlier we gave the profit as a percentage of revenue of three wholesale clubs as         and      With an odd number of  observations  n      the median occupies the  n                 nd position  The median was     percent  The value of      percent is the  middlemost  observation  One lies above it and one lies below it  Whether we use the calculation for  an even  or odd numbered sample an equal number of observations lie above and below the median  A distribution has  only one median 
9,449,A potential advantage of the median is that unlike the mean extreme values do not affect it  The median however does  not use all the information about the size and magnitude of the observations  it focuses only on the relative position of the  ranked observations  Calculating the median is also more complex  to do so we need to order the observations from  smallest to largest determine whether the sample size is even or odd and on that basis apply one of two calculations   Mathematicians express this disadvantage by saying that the median is less mathematically tractable than the mean 
10,449,To demonstrate finding the median we use the data from Example   reproduced in Table   in ascending order of the       total return for European equities  Because this sample has    observations the median is the mean of the values in  the sorted array that occupy the         th and         th positions  Finland s return occupies the eighth position with a  return of      percent and Sweden s return occupies the ninth position with a return of       percent  The median as the  mean of these two returns is                           percent  Note that the median is not influenced by extremely  large or small outcomes  Had Spain s total return been a much lower value or Belgium s total return a much larger value  the median would not have changed  Using a context that arises often in practice Example   shows how to use the mean  and median in a sample with extreme values

6,451,The sample has an odd number of observations with n     so the median occupies the  n                 th  position in the sorted list  Therefore the median P E is       
7,451,Solution to   
8,451,Qlik Technologies  P E of approximately     tremendously influences the value of the portfolio s arithmetic  mean P E  The mean P E of about    is much larger than the P E of six of the seven stocks in the portfolio  The  mean P E also misleadingly suggests an orientation to stocks with high P Es  The mean P E of the stocks  excluding Qlik Technologies or excluding the largest  and smallest P E stocks  Qlik Technologies and Ford  Motor Company  is below the average P E of       for the companies in the S P     Index  The median P E of        appears to better represent the central tendency of the P Es 
9,451,It frequently happens that when a company s EPS is quite low at a low point in the business cycle for  example its P E is extremely high  The high P E in those circumstances reflects an anticipated future recovery  of earnings  Extreme P E values need to be investigated and handled with care  For reasons related to this  example analysts often use the median of price multiples to characterize the valuation of industry groups 
10,451,     The Mode
11,451,The third important measure of central tendency is the mode 
12,451,  Definition of Mode  The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a distribution   
13,451,A distribution can have more than one mode or even no mode  When a distribution has one most frequently occurring  value the distribution is said to be unimodal  If a distribution has two most frequently occurring values then it has two  modes and we say it is bimodal  If the distribution has three most frequently occurring values then it is trimodal  When  all the values in a data set are different the distribution has no mode because no value occurs more frequently than any  other value 
14,451,Stock return data and other data from continuous distributions may not have a modal outcome  When such data are  grouped into intervals however we often find an interval  possibly more than one  with the highest frequency  the  modal interval  or intervals   For example the frequency distribution for the monthly returns on the S P     has a  modal interval of   percent to   percent as shown in Figure    this return interval has     observations out of a total of        The modal interval always has the highest bar in the histogram 
15,451,The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data  When we categorize mutual funds  into different styles and assign a number to each style the mode of these categorized data is the most frequent mutual  fund style 
16,451,     Other Concepts of Mean
17,451,Earlier we explained the arithmetic mean which is a fundamental concept for describing the central tendency of data   Other concepts of mean are very important in investments however  In the following we discuss such concepts

2,453,       The Weighted Mean
3,453,The concept of weighted mean arises repeatedly in portfolio analysis  In the arithmetic mean all observations are equally  weighted by the factor   n  or   N   In working with portfolios we need the more general concept of weighted mean to  allow different weights on different observations 
4,453,To illustrate the weighted mean concept an investment manager with      million to invest might allocate     million  to equities and     million to bonds  The portfolio has a weight of      on stocks and      on bonds  How do we  calculate the return on this portfolio  The portfolio s return clearly involves an averaging of the returns on the stock and  bond investments  The mean that we compute however must reflect the fact that stocks have a    percent weight in the  portfolio and bonds have a    percent weight  The way to reflect this weighting is to multiply the return on the stock  investment by      and the return on the bond investment by      then sum the two results  This sum is an example of a  weighted mean  It would be incorrect to take an arithmetic mean of the return on the stock and bond investments equally  weighting the returns on the two asset classes 
5,453,Consider a portfolio invested in Canadian stocks and bonds  The stock component of the portfolio includes the RBC  Canadian Index Fund which tracks the performance of the S P TSX Composite Total Return Index  The bond  component of the portfolio includes the RBC Bond Fund which invests in high quality fixed income securities issued by  Canadian governments and corporations  The portfolio manager allocates    percent of the portfolio to the Canadian  stock fund and    percent to the Canadian bond fund  Table    presents total returns for these funds from      to

15,453,where the sum of the weights equals    that is  
16,453,i
17,453,wi     
18,453,In the context of portfolios a positive weight represents an asset held long and a negative weight represents an asset held  short   
19,453,The return on the portfolio under consideration is the weighted average of the return on the Canadian stock fund and the  Canadian bond fund  the weight of the stock fund is       that of the bond fund is        We find using Equation   that

22,453,        
23,453,It should be clear that the correct mean to compute in this example is the weighted mean and not the arithmetic mean  If  we had computed the arithmetic mean for      we would have calculated a return equal to                                                     Given that the portfolio manager invested    percent in stocks and    percent in bonds  the arithmetic mean would underweight the investment in stocks and overweight the investment in bonds resulting in a  number for portfolio return that is too high by     percentage points

2,454,Now suppose that the portfolio manager maintains constant weights of    percent in stocks and    percent in bonds for  all five years  This method is called a constant proportions strategy  Because value is price multiplied by quantity price  fluctuation causes portfolio weights to change  As a result the constant proportions strategy requires rebalancing to  restore the weights in stocks and bonds to their target levels  Assuming that the portfolio manager is able to accomplish  the necessary rebalancing we can compute the portfolio returns in                and      with Equation   as  follows

7,454,We can now find the time series mean of the returns for      through      using Equation   for the arithmetic mean   The time series mean total return for the portfolio is                                                    percent 
8,454,Instead of calculating the portfolio time series mean return from portfolio annual returns we can calculate the arithmetic  mean stock and bond fund returns for the five years and then apply the portfolio weights of      and      respectively  to those values  The mean stock fund return is                                                    percent  The mean bond  fund return is                                                   percent  Therefore the mean total return for the portfolio  is                             percent which agrees with our previous calculation

2,455,The previous examples illustrate the general principle that a portfolio return is a weighted sum  Specifically a portfolio s  return is the weighted average of the returns on the assets in the portfolio  the weight applied to each asset s return is the  fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset 
3,455,Market indexes are computed as weighted averages  For market capitalization indexes such as the CAC    in France or  the TOPIX in Japan or the S P     in the United States each included stock receives a weight corresponding to its  outstanding market value divided by the total market value of all stocks in the index 
4,455,Our illustrations of weighted mean use past data but they might just as well use forward looking data  When we take a  weighted average of forward looking data the weighted mean is called expected value  Suppose we make one forecast  for the year end level of the S P     assuming economic expansion and another forecast for the year end level of the  S P     assuming economic contraction  If we multiply the first forecast by the probability of expansion and the second  forecast by the probability of contraction and then add these weighted forecasts we are calculating the expected value of  the S P     at year end  If we take a weighted average of possible future returns on the S P     we are computing the  S P     s expected return  The probabilities must sum to   satisfying the condition on the weights in the expression for  weighted mean Equation   
5,455,       The Geometric Mean
6,455,The geometric mean is most frequently used to average rates of change over time or to compute the growth rate of a  variable  In investments we frequently use the geometric mean to average a time series of rates of return on an asset or a  portfolio or to compute the growth rate of a financial variable such as earnings or sales  In the reading on the time value  of money for instance we computed a sales growth rate  Example      That growth rate was a geometric mean  Because  of the subject s importance in a later section we will return to the use of the geometric mean and offer practical  perspectives on its use  The geometric mean is defined by the following formula 
7,455,  Geometric Mean Formula  The geometric mean G of a set of observations X  X    Xn is
8,455,Equation    
9,455,G   n X X X    Xn
10,455,with Xi     for i      n 
11,455,Equation   has a solution and the geometric mean exists only if the product under the radical sign is non negative  We  impose the restriction that all the observations Xi in Equation   are greater than or equal to zero  We can solve for the  geometric mean using Equation   directly with any calculator that has an exponentiation key  on most calculators yx    We can also solve for the geometric mean using natural logarithms  Equation   can also be stated as
12,455,or as
13,455, 
14,455,ln G   ln  X X X    Xn   n
15,455,n 
16,455,i  
17,455,ln Xi

20,455,When we have computed ln G then G   elnG  on most calculators the key for this step is ex  
21,455,Risky assets can have negative returns up to      percent  if their price falls to zero  so we must take some care in  defining the relevant variables to average in computing a geometric mean  We cannot just use the product of the returns  for the sample and then take the nth root because the returns for any period could be negative  We must redefine the  returns to make them positive  We do this by adding     to the returns expressed as decimals  The term      Rt   represents the year ending value relative to an initial unit of investment at the beginning of the year  As long as we use       Rt  the observations will never be negative because the biggest negative return is      percent  The result is the  geometric mean of     Rt  by then subtracting     from this result we obtain the geometric mean of the individual returns  Rt  For example the returns on RBC Canadian Index Fund during the           period were given in Table    as                            and       putting the returns into decimal form  Adding     to those returns produces                          and        Using Equation   we have

2,456,This number is   plus the geometric mean rate of return  Subtracting     from this result we have                            or approximately      percent  The geometric mean return of RBC Canadian Index Fund during the            period was      percent 
3,456,An equation that summarizes the calculation of the geometric mean return RG is a slightly modified version of Equation    in which the Xi represent      return in decimal form   Because geometric mean returns use time series we use a  subscript t indexing time as well

15,457,In Example   for both mutual funds the geometric mean return was less than the arithmetic mean return  In fact the  geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean    The only time that the two means will be equal is  when there is no variability in the observations that is when all the observations in the series are the same    In  Example   there was variability in the funds  returns  thus for both funds the geometric mean was strictly less than the  arithmetic mean  In general the difference between the arithmetic and geometric means increases with the variability in  the period by period observations    This relationship is also illustrated by Example    Casual inspection suggests that  the returns of SLASX are somewhat more variable than those of PRFDX and consequently the spread between the  arithmetic and geometric mean returns is larger for SLASX      basis points  than for PRFDX      basis points     Arithmetic and geometric returns need not always rank funds similarly however in this example PRFDX has both  higher arithmetic and geometric mean returns than SLASX  However the difference between the geometric mean returns  of the two funds         is greater than the difference between the arithmetic mean returns of the two funds           How should the analyst interpret these results

2,458,The geometric mean return represents the growth rate or compound rate of return on an investment  One dollar invested  in SLASX at the beginning of      would have grown  or in this case decreased  to                                                     which is equal to   plus the geometric mean return compounded over five periods                                              confirming that the geometric mean is the compound rate of return  For PRFDX one dollar  would have grown to a larger amount                                                    equal to              With  its focus on the profitability of an investment over a multiperiod horizon the geometric mean is of key interest to  investors  The arithmetic mean return focusing on average single period performance is also of interest  Both arithmetic  and geometric means have a role to play in investment management and both are often reported for return series   Example   highlights these points in a simple context 
3,458,EXAMPLE  
4,458,Geometric and Arithmetic Mean Returns    
5,458,A hypothetical investment in a single stock initially costs       One year later the stock is trading at       At the  end of the second year the stock price falls back to the original purchase price of       No dividends are paid  during the two year period  Calculate the arithmetic and geometric mean annual returns 
6,458,Solution 
7,458,First we need to find the Year   and Year   annual returns with Equation   
8,458,Return in Year                       
9,458,Return in Year                       
10,458,The arithmetic mean of the annual returns is                      
11,458,Before we find the geometric mean we must convert the percentage rates of return to      Rt   After this  adjustment the geometric mean from Equation   is                     percent 
12,458,The geometric mean return of   percent accurately reflects that the ending value of the investment in Year    equals the starting value in Year    The compound rate of return on the investment is   percent  The arithmetic  mean return reflects the average of the one year returns 
13,458,       The Harmonic Mean
14,458,The arithmetic mean the weighted mean and the geometric mean are the most frequently used concepts of mean in  investments  A fourth concept the harmonic mean    X H  is appropriate in a limited number of applications   
15,458,  Harmonic Mean Formula  The harmonic mean of a set of observations X  X    Xn is
16,458,Equation    
17,458,   X H   n 
18,458,n 
19,458,i  
20,458,   Xi  
21,458,with Xi     for i      n
22,458,The harmonic mean is the value obtained by summing the reciprocals of the observations terms of the form   Xi then  averaging that sum by dividing it by the number of observations n and finally taking the reciprocal of the average 
23,458,The harmonic mean may be viewed as a special type of weighted mean in which an observation s weight is inversely  proportional to its magnitude  The harmonic mean is a relatively specialized concept of the mean that is appropriate when  averaging ratios   amount per unit   when the ratios are repeatedly applied to a fixed quantity to yield a variable number  of units  The concept is best explained through an illustration  A well known application arises in the investment strategy  known as cost averaging which involves the periodic investment of a fixed amount of money  In this application the  ratios we are averaging are prices per share at purchases dates and we are applying those prices to a constant amount of  money to yield a variable number of shares 
24,458,Suppose an investor purchases       of a security each month for n     months  The share prices are     and     at the  two purchase dates  What is the average price paid for the security

2,459,In this example in the first month we purchase                 shares and in the second month we purchase                    or        shares in total  Dividing the total euro amount invested       by the total number of  shares purchased        gives an average price paid of                     The average price paid is in fact the  harmonic mean of the asset s prices at the purchase dates  Using Equation   the harmonic mean price is                             The value     is less than the arithmetic mean purchase price                        However we could  find the correct value of     using the weighted mean formula where the weights on the purchase prices equal the shares  purchased at a given price as a proportion of the total shares purchased  In our example the calculation would be                                                   If we had invested varying amounts of money at each date we could  not use the harmonic mean formula  We could however still use the weighted mean formula in a manner similar to that  just described 
3,459,A mathematical fact concerning the harmonic geometric and arithmetic means is that unless all the observations in a  data set have the same value the harmonic mean is less than the geometric mean which in turn is less than the arithmetic  mean  In the illustration given the harmonic mean price was indeed less than the arithmetic mean price 
4,459,   OTHER MEASURES OF LOCATION  QUANTILES
5,459,Having discussed measures of central tendency we now examine an approach to describing the location of data that  involves identifying values at or below which specified proportions of the data lie  For example establishing that        and    percent of the annual returns on a portfolio are at or below the values            and      respectively provides  concise information about the distribution of portfolio returns  Statisticians use the word quantile  or fractile  as the  most general term for a value at or below which a stated fraction of the data lies  In the following we describe the most  commonly used quantiles quartiles quintiles deciles and percentiles and their application in investments 
6,459,     Quartiles Quintiles Deciles and Percentiles
7,459,We know that the median divides a distribution in half  We can define other dividing lines that split the distribution into  smaller sizes  Quartiles divide the distribution into quarters quintiles into fifths deciles into tenths and percentiles into hundredths  Given a set of observations the yth percentile is the value at or below which y percent of observations  lie  Percentiles are used frequently and the other measures can be defined with respect to them  For example the first  quartile  Q   divides a distribution such that    percent of the observations lie at or below it  therefore the first quartile is  also the   th percentile  The second quartile  Q   represents the   th percentile and the third quartile  Q   represents the    th percentile because    percent of the observations lie at or below it 
8,459,When dealing with actual data we often find that we need to approximate the value of a percentile  For example if we  are interested in the value of the   th percentile we may find that no observation divides the sample such that exactly     percent of the observations lie at or below that value  The following procedure however can help us determine or  estimate a percentile  The procedure involves first locating the position of the percentile within the set of observations  and then determining  or estimating  the value associated with that position 
9,459,Let Py be the value at or below which y percent of the distribution lies or the yth percentile   For example P   is the point  at or below which    percent of the observations lie                percent are greater than P     The formula for the  position of a percentile in an array with n entries sorted in ascending order is
10,459,Equation    
11,459,Ly    n     
12,459,y
13,459,   
14,459,where y is the percentage point at which we are dividing the distribution and Ly is the location  L  of the percentile  Py  in  the array sorted in ascending order  The value of Ly may or may not be a whole number  In general as the sample size  increases the percentile location calculation becomes more accurate  in small samples it may be quite approximate 
15,459,As an example of the case in which Ly is not a whole number suppose that we want to determine the third quartile of  returns for       Q  or P    for the    European equity markets given in Table    According to Equation   the position  of the third quartile is L                              or between the   th and   th items in Table   which ordered the  returns into ascending order  The   th item in Table   is the return to equities in France in            percent  The   th  item is the return to equities in Austria in            percent  Reflecting the        in         we would conclude that  P   lies    percent of the distance between       percent and       percent

2,460,To summarize 
3,460,  When the location Ly is a whole number the location corresponds to an actual observation  For example if  Denmark had not been included in the sample then n     would have been    and with L        the third quartile  would be P     X   where Xi is defined as the value of the observation in the ith  i   L    position of the data sorted  in ascending order  i e  P           
4,460,  When Ly is not a whole number or integer Ly lies between the two closest integer numbers  one above and one  below  and we use linear interpolation between those two places to determine Py  Interpolation means  estimating an unknown value on the basis of two known values that surround it  lie above and below it   the term   linear  refers to a straight line estimate  Returning to the calculation of P   for the equity returns we found that Ly          the next lower whole number is    and the next higher whole number is     Using linear interpolation P     X                   X     X     As above in the   th position is the return to equities in France so X            percent  X           percent the return to equities in Austria  Thus our estimate is P     X                  X      X                                                                               percent  In words       and        bracket P   from below and above respectively  Because                   using linear interpolation we  move    percent of the distance from       to       as our estimate of P    We follow this pattern whenever Ly is a  non integer  The nearest whole numbers below and above Ly establish the positions of observations that bracket Py and then interpolate between the values of those two observations

2,463,Investment analysts use quantiles every day to rank performance for example the performance of portfolios  The  performance of investment managers is often characterized in terms of the quartile in which they fall relative to the  performance of their peer group of managers  The Morningstar mutual fund star rankings for example associates the  number of stars with percentiles of performance relative to similar style mutual funds 
3,463,Another key use of quantiles is in investment research  Analysts refer to a group defined by a particular quantile as that  quantile  For example analysts often refer to the set of companies with returns falling below the   th percentile cutoff  point as the bottom return decile  Dividing data into quantiles based on some characteristic allows analysts to evaluate  the impact of that characteristic on a quantity of interest  For instance empirical finance studies commonly rank  companies based on the market value of their equity and then sort them into deciles  The  st decile contains the portfolio  of those companies with the smallest market values and the   th decile contains those companies with the largest market  value  Ranking companies by decile allows analysts to compare the performance of small companies with large ones 
4,463,We can illustrate the use of quantiles in particular quartiles in investment research using the example of Ibbotson et al           That study proposed an investment style based on liquidity buying stocks of less liquid stocks and selling  stocks of more liquid stocks  It compared the performance of this style with three already popular investment styles  which include     firm size  buying stocks of small firms and selling stocks of large firms      value growth  buying  stocks of value firms defined as firms for which the stock price is relatively low in relation to earnings per share book  value per share or dividends per share and selling stocks of growth firms defined as firms for which the stock price is  relatively high in relation to those same measures  and     momentum  buying stocks of firms with a high momentum in  returns or winners and selling stocks of firms with a low momentum or losers  
5,463,Ibbotson et al  examined the top      US stocks by market capitalization for the period of            For each stock  they computed yearly measures of liquidity as the annual share turnover  the sum of the    monthly volumes divided by  each month s shares outstanding  size as the year end market capitalization value as the trailing earnings to price ratio  as of the year end and momentum as the annual return  They assigned one fourth of the total sample with the lowest  liquidity in a year to Quartile   and the one fourth with the highest liquidity in that year to Quartile    The stocks with the  second highest liquidity formed Quartile   and the stocks with the second lowest liquidity Quartile    Treating each  quartile group as a portfolio composed of equally weighted stocks they measured the returns on each liquidity quartile in  the following year  so that the quartiles are constructed  before the fact    The authors repeated this process for each of  the other three investment styles  size value and momentum   The results from Table   of their study are included in  Table     We have added a column with the spreads in returns from Quartile   to Quartile   
6,463,Table    reports each investment style s geometric and arithmetic mean returns and standard deviation of returns for  each quartile grouping  In each style moving from Quartile   to Quartile   mean returns decrease  For example the  geometric mean return for the least liquid stocks is        and for the most liquid stocks is        Only for the case of  size does standard deviation decrease at each step moving from Quartile   to Quartile    Thus the table provides  evidence that the investment styles generally having incremental value in explaining returns in relation to standard  deviation  The authors conclude that liquidity appears to differentiate the returns approximately as well as the other  styles

2,465,   MEASURES OF DISPERSION
3,465,As the well known researcher Fischer Black has written   t he key issue in investments is estimating expected return     Few would disagree with the importance of expected return or mean return in investments  The mean return tells us  where returns and investment results are centered  To completely understand an investment however we also need to  know how returns are dispersed around the mean  Dispersion is the variability around the central tendency  If mean  return addresses reward dispersion addresses risk 
4,465,In this section we examine the most common measures of dispersion  range mean absolute deviation variance and  standard deviation  These are all measures of absolute dispersion  Absolute dispersion is the amount of variability  present without comparison to any reference point or benchmark 
5,465,These measures are used throughout investment practice  The variance or standard deviation of return is often used as a  measure of risk pioneered by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz  William Sharpe another winner of the Nobel Prize in  economics developed the Sharpe ratio a measure of risk adjusted performance  That measure makes use of standard  deviation of return  Other measures of dispersion mean absolute deviation and range are also useful in analyzing data 
6,465,     The Range
7,465,We encountered range earlier when we discussed the construction of frequency distribution  The simplest of all the  measures of dispersion range can be computed with interval or ratio data 
8,465,  Definition of Range  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set 
9,465,Equation    
10,465,Range   Maximum value   Minimum value
11,465,As an illustration of range the largest monthly return for the S P     in the period from January      to December       is       percent  in April       and the smallest is        percent  in September        The range of returns is  thus       percent        percent           percent    An alternative definition of range reports the maximum and  minimum values  This alternative definition provides more information than does the range as defined in Equation   
12,465,One advantage of the range is ease of computation  A disadvantage is that the range uses only two pieces of information  from the distribution  It cannot tell us how the data are distributed  that is the shape of the distribution   Because the  range is the difference between the maximum and minimum returns it can reflect extremely large or small outcomes that  may not be representative of the distribution   
13,465,     The Mean Absolute Deviation
14,465,Measures of dispersion can be computed using all the observations in the distribution rather than just the highest and  lowest  The question is how should we measure dispersion  Our previous discussion on properties of the arithmetic  mean introduced the notion of distance or deviation from the mean  Xi      X   as a fundamental piece of information  used in statistics  We could compute measures of dispersion as the arithmetic average of the deviations around the mean  but we would encounter a problem  The deviations around the mean always sum to    If we computed the mean of the  deviations the result would also equal    Therefore we need to find a way to address the problem of negative deviations  canceling out positive deviations 
15,465,One solution is to examine the absolute deviations around the mean as in the mean absolute deviation 
16,465,  Mean Absolute Deviation Formula  The mean absolute deviation  MAD  for a sample is

2,466,In calculating MAD we ignore the signs of the deviations around the mean  For example if Xi         and    X       the  absolute value of the difference is                                 The mean absolute deviation uses all of the observations  in the sample and is thus superior to the range as a measure of dispersion  One technical drawback of MAD is that it is  difficult to manipulate mathematically compared with the next measure we will introduce variance    Example    illustrates the use of the range and the mean absolute deviation in evaluating risk 
3,466,EXAMPLE   
4,466,The Range and the Mean Absolute Deviation

11,467,     Population Variance and Population Standard Deviation
12,467,The mean absolute deviation addressed the issue that the sum of deviations from the mean equals zero by taking the  absolute value of the deviations  A second approach to the treatment of deviations is to square them  The variance and  standard deviation which are based on squared deviations are the two most widely used measures of dispersion   Variance is defined as the average of the squared deviations around the mean  Standard deviation is the positive  square root of the variance  The following discussion addresses the calculation and use of variance and standard  deviation 
13,467,       Population Variance
14,467,If we know every member of a population we can compute the population variance  Denoted by the symbol    the  population variance is the arithmetic average of the squared deviations around the mean 
15,467,  Population Variance Formula  The population variance is
16,467,Equation

21,467,N
22,467,     
23,467,where   is the population mean and N is the size of the population 
24,467,Given knowledge of the population mean   we can use Equation    to calculate the sum of the squared differences  from the mean taking account of all N items in the population and then to find the mean squared difference by dividing  the sum by N  Whether a difference from the mean is positive or negative squaring that difference results in a positive  number  Thus variance takes care of the problem of negative deviations from the mean canceling out positive deviations  by the operation of squaring those deviations  The profit as a percentage of revenue for BJ s Wholesale Club Costco and  Walmart was given earlier as         and     respectively  We calculated the mean profit as a percentage of revenue as       Therefore the population variance of the profit as a percentage of revenue is                                                                                                                                   
25,467,       Population Standard Deviation
26,467,Because the variance is measured in squared units we need a way to return to the original units  We can solve this  problem by using standard deviation the square root of the variance  Standard deviation is more easily interpreted than  the variance because standard deviation is expressed in the same unit of measurement as the observations 
27,467,  Population Standard Deviation Formula  The population standard deviation defined as the positive square  root of the population variance is

3,468,Both the population variance and standard deviation are examples of parameters of a distribution  In later readings we  will introduce the notion of variance and standard deviation as risk measures 
4,468,In investments we often do not know the mean of a population of interest usually because we cannot practically identify  or take measurements from each member of the population  We then estimate the population mean with the mean from a  sample drawn from the population and we calculate a sample variance or standard deviation using formulas different  from Equations    and     We shall discuss these calculations in subsequent sections  However in investments we  sometimes have a defined group that we can consider to be a population  With well defined populations we use  Equations    and    as in the following example

13,469,     Sample Variance and Sample Standard Deviation
14,469,In the following discussion note the switch to Roman letters to symbolize sample quantities 
15,469,       Sample Variance
16,469,In many instances in investment management a subset or sample of the population is all that we can observe  When we  deal with samples the summary measures are called statistics  The statistic that measures the dispersion in a sample is  called the sample variance

24,469,where    X is the sample mean and n is the number of observations in the sample 
25,469,Equation    tells us to take the following steps to compute the sample variance 
26,469,i  Calculate the sample mean    X

2,470,We use the notation s  for the sample variance to distinguish it from population variance     The formula for sample  variance is nearly the same as that for population variance except for the use of the sample mean    X  in place of the  population mean   and a different divisor  In the case of the population variance we divide by the size of the  population N  For the sample variance however we divide by the sample size minus   or n      By using n      rather  than n  as the divisor we improve the statistical properties of the sample variance  In statistical terms the sample  variance defined in Equation    is an unbiased estimator of the population variance    The quantity n     is also known  as the number of degrees of freedom in estimating the population variance  To estimate the population variance with s   we must first calculate the mean  Once we have computed the sample mean there are only n     independent deviations  from it 
3,470,       Sample Standard Deviation

13,472,An asset s variance or standard deviation of returns is often interpreted as a measure of the asset s risk  Variance and  standard deviation of returns take account of returns above and below the mean but investors are concerned only with  downside risk for example returns below the mean  As a result analysts have developed semivariance semideviation  and related dispersion measures that focus on downside risk  Semivariance is defined as the average squared deviation  below the mean  Semideviation  sometimes called semistandard deviation  is the positive square root of  semivariance    To compute the sample semivariance for example we take the following steps 
14,472,i  Calculate the sample mean 
15,472,ii  Identify the observations that are smaller than or equal to the mean  discarding observations greater than the  mean  
16,472,iii  Compute the sum of the squared negative deviations from the mean  using the observations that are smaller than or  equal to the mean  
17,472,iv  Divide the sum of the squared negative deviations from Step iii by the total sample size minus    n      A formula  for semivariance approximating the unbiased estimator is

2,473,To take the case of Selected American Shares with returns  in percent  of                          and       we  earlier calculated a mean return of      percent  Two returns        and       are smaller than       We compute the  sum of the squared negative deviations from the mean as                                                                                     With n         we conclude that semivariance is                   and that semideviation  is               percent approximately  The semideviation of      percent is less than the standard deviation of       percent  From this downside risk perspective therefore standard deviation overstates risk 
3,473,In practice we may be concerned with values of return  or another variable  below some level other than the mean  For  example if our return objective is       percent annually we may be concerned particularly with returns below        percent a year  We can call       percent the target  The name target semivariance has been given to average squared  deviation below a stated target and target semideviation is its positive square root  To calculate a sample target  semivariance we specify the target as a first step  After identifying observations below the target we find the sum of the  squared negative deviations from the target and divide that sum by the number of observations minus    A formula for  target semivariance is

7,473,where B is the target and n is the number of observations  With a target return of       percent we find in the case of  Selected American Shares that three returns               and        were below the target  The target semivariance is                                                                             and the target semideviation is                 percent approximately 
8,473,When return distributions are symmetric semivariance and variance are effectively equivalent  For asymmetric  distributions variance and semivariance rank prospects  risk differently    Semivariance  or semideviation  and target  semivariance  or target semideviation  have intuitive appeal but they are harder to work with mathematically than  variance    Variance or standard deviation enters into the definition of many of the most commonly used finance risk  concepts such as the Sharpe ratio and beta  Perhaps because of these reasons variance  or standard deviation  is much  more frequently used in investment practice

10,473,The Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev developed an inequality using standard deviation as a measure of  dispersion  The inequality gives the proportion of values within k standard deviations of the mean 
11,473,  Definition of Chebyshev s Inequality  According to Chebyshev s inequality for any distribution with finite  variance the proportion of the observations within k standard deviations of the arithmetic mean is at least       k  for all k     
12,473,Table    illustrates the proportion of the observations that must lie within a certain number of standard deviations  around the sample mean

2,474,When k        for example the inequality states that the minimum proportion of the observations that lie within       s is                                 or    percent 
3,474,The most frequently cited facts that result from Chebyshev s inequality are that a two standard deviation interval around  the mean must contain at least    percent of the observations and a three standard deviation interval around the mean  must contain at least    percent of the observations no matter how the data are distributed 
4,474,The importance of Chebyshev s inequality stems from its generality  The inequality holds for samples and populations  and for discrete and continuous data regardless of the shape of the distribution  As we shall see in the reading on  sampling we can make much more precise interval statements if we can assume that the sample is drawn from a  population that follows a specific distribution called the normal distribution  Frequently however we cannot confidently  assume that distribution 
5,474,The next example illustrates the use of Chebyshev s inequality 
6,474,EXAMPLE   
7,474,Applying Chebyshev s Inequality
8,474,According to Table    the arithmetic mean monthly return and standard deviation of monthly returns on the  S P     were      percent and      percent respectively during the           period totaling      monthly  observations  Using this information address the following 
9,474,   Calculate the endpoints of the interval that must contain at least    percent of monthly returns according to  Chebyshev s inequality 
10,474,   What are the minimum and maximum number of observations that must lie in the interval computed in Part    according to Chebyshev s inequality 
11,474,Solution to   
12,474,According to Chebyshev s inequality at least    percent of the observations must lie within two standard  deviations of the mean    X    s  For the monthly S P     return series we have                                     Thus the lower endpoint of the interval that must contain at least    percent of the observations is                           and the upper endpoint is                         
13,474,Solution to   
14,474,For a sample size of      at least                  observations must lie in the interval from         to         that we computed in Part    Chebyshev s inequality gives the minimum percentage of observations that  must fall within a given interval around the mean but it does not give the maximum percentage  Table   which  gave the frequency distribution of monthly returns on the S P     is excerpted below  The data in the excerpted  table are consistent with the prediction of Chebyshev s inequality  The set of intervals running from        to        is about equal in width to the two standard deviation interval         to         A total of       observations  approximately    percent of observations  fall in the range from        to

3,475,     Coefficient of Variation
4,475,We noted earlier that standard deviation is more easily interpreted than variance because standard deviation uses the  same units of measurement as the observations  We may sometimes find it difficult to interpret what standard deviation  means in terms of the relative degree of variability of different sets of data however either because the data sets have  markedly different means or because the data sets have different units of measurement  In this section we explain a  measure of relative dispersion the coefficient of variation that can be useful in such situations  Relative dispersion is  the amount of dispersion relative to a reference value or benchmark 
5,475,We can illustrate the problem of interpreting the standard deviation of data sets with markedly different means using two  hypothetical samples of companies  The first sample composed of small companies includes companies with      sales  of     million     million     million and     million  The second sample composed of large companies includes  companies with      sales of      million      million      million and      million  We can verify using Equation     that the standard deviation of sales in both samples is       million    In the first sample the largest observation      million is    percent larger than the smallest observation     million  In the second sample the largest observation is  only   percent larger than the smallest observation  Informally a standard deviation of       million represents a high  degree of variability relative to the first sample which reflects mean      sales of     million but a small degree of  variability relative to the second sample which reflects mean      sales of      million 
6,475,The coefficient of variation is helpful in situations such as that just described 
7,475,  Coefficient of Variation Formula  The coefficient of variation CV is the ratio of the standard deviation of a  set of observations to their mean value   
8,475,Equation     
9,475,where s is the sample standard deviation and    X is the sample mean 
10,475,CV   s     X
11,475,When the observations are returns for example the coefficient of variation measures the amount of risk  standard  deviation  per unit of mean return  Expressing the magnitude of variation among observations relative to their average  size the coefficient of variation permits direct comparisons of dispersion across different data sets  Reflecting the  correction for scale the coefficient of variation is a scale free measure  that is it has no units of measurement  
12,475,We can illustrate the application of the coefficient of variation using our earlier example of two samples of companies   The coefficient of variation for the first sample is        million       million          the coefficient of variation for the  second sample is        million        million          This confirms our intuition that the first sample had much greater  variability in sales than the second sample  Note that      and      are pure numbers in the sense that they are free of  units of measurement  because we divided the standard deviation by the mean which is measured in the same units as  the standard deviation   If we need to compare the dispersion among data sets stated in different units of measurement  the coefficient of variation can be useful because it is free from units of measurement  Example    illustrates the  calculation of the coefficient of variation

9,476,   Rank the markets from most risky to least risky using CV as a measure of relative dispersion 
10,476,   Determine whether there is more difference between the absolute or the relative riskiness of the Hong Kong  and Singapore markets  Use the standard deviation as a measure of absolute risk and CV as a measure of  relative risk

17,476,Based on CV the ranking for the           period examined is Australia  most risky  Hong Kong Singapore  and South Korea  least risky  
18,476,Solution to   
19,476,As measured both by standard deviation and CV Hong Kong market was riskier than the Singapore market  The  standard deviation of Hong Kong returns was                            or about    percent larger than  Singapore returns compared with a difference in the CV of                               or about    percent   Thus the CVs reveal slightly less difference between Hong Kong and Singapore return variability than that  suggested by the standard deviations alone 
20,476,     The Sharpe Ratio
21,476,Although CV was designed as a measure of relative dispersion its inverse reveals something about return per unit of risk  because the standard deviation of returns is commonly used as a measure of investment risk  For example a portfolio  with a mean monthly return of      percent and a standard deviation of      percent has an inverse CV of                      This result indicates that each unit of standard deviation represents a      percent return

2,477,A more precise return risk measure recognizes the existence of a risk free return a return for virtually zero standard  deviation  With a risk free asset an investor can choose a risky portfolio p and then combine that portfolio with the risk  free asset to achieve any desired level of absolute risk as measured by standard deviation of return sp  Consider a graph  with mean return on the vertical axis and standard deviation of return on the horizontal axis  Any combination of  portfolio p and the risk free asset lies on a ray  line  with slope equal to the quantity  Mean return   Risk free return   divided by sp  The ray giving investors choices offering the most reward  return in excess of the risk free rate  per unit of  risk is the one with the highest slope  The ratio of excess return to standard deviation of return for a portfolio p the  slope of the ray passing through p is a single number measure of a portfolio s performance known as the Sharpe ratio  after its developer William F  Sharpe 
3,477,  Sharpe Ratio Formula  The Sharpe ratio for a portfolio p based on historical returns is defined as
4,477,Equation     
5,477,Sh  
6,477,   R p      R F
7,477,sp
8,477,where    R p is the mean return to the portfolio    R F is the mean return to a risk free asset and sp is the standard  deviation of return on the portfolio   
9,477,The numerator of the Sharpe measure is the portfolio s mean return minus the mean return on the risk free asset over the  sample period  The    R p      R F term measures the extra reward that investors receive for the added risk taken  We call this  difference the mean excess return on portfolio p  Thus the Sharpe ratio measures the reward in terms of mean excess  return per unit of risk as measured by standard deviation of return  Those risk averse investors who make decisions only  in terms of mean return and standard deviation of return prefer portfolios with larger Sharpe ratios to those with smaller  Sharpe ratios 
10,477,To illustrate the calculation of the Sharpe ratio consider the performance of two exchange traded funds  SPDR S P      seeks to track the investment results of the S P     Index  large capitalization US stocks  and iShares Russell       Index seeks to track the investment results of the Russell      Index  small capitalization US stocks   Table    presents  the historical arithmetic mean return along with the historical standard deviation of returns for annual returns series of  these two funds and the US    day T bill during the           period

2,478,Finance theory tells us that in the long run investors should be compensated with additional mean return above the risk  free rate for bearing additional risk at least if the risky portfolio is well diversified  If investors are so compensated the  numerator of the Sharpe ratio will be positive  Nevertheless we often find that portfolios exhibit negative Sharpe ratios  when the ratio is calculated over periods in which bear markets for equities dominate  This raises a caution when dealing  with negative Sharpe ratios  With positive Sharpe ratios a portfolio s Sharpe ratio decreases if we increase risk all else  equal  That result is intuitive for a risk adjusted performance measure  With negative Sharpe ratios however increasing  risk results in a numerically larger Sharpe ratio  for example doubling risk may increase the Sharpe ratio from    to         Therefore in a comparison of portfolios with negative Sharpe ratios we cannot generally interpret the larger  Sharpe ratio  the one closer to zero  to mean better risk adjusted performance    Practically to make an interpretable  comparison in such cases using the Sharpe ratio we may need to increase the evaluation period such that one or more of  the Sharpe ratios becomes positive  we might also consider using a different performance evaluation metric 
3,478,The conceptual limitation of the Sharpe ratio is that it considers only one aspect of risk standard deviation of return   Standard deviation is most appropriate as a risk measure for portfolio strategies with approximately symmetric return  distributions  Strategies with option elements have asymmetric returns  Relatedly an investment strategy may produce  frequent small gains but have the potential for infrequent but extremely large losses    Such a strategy is sometimes  described as picking up coins in front of a bulldozer  for example some hedge fund strategies tend to produce that return  pattern  Calculated over a period in which the strategy is working  a large loss has not occurred  this type of strategy  would have a high Sharpe ratio  In this case the Sharpe ratio would give an overly optimistic picture of risk adjusted  performance because standard deviation would incompletely measure the risk assumed    Therefore before applying the  Sharpe ratio to evaluate a manager we should judge whether standard deviation adequately describes the risk of the  manager s investment strategy

7,479,   SYMMETRY AND SKEWNESS IN RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS
8,479,Mean and variance may not adequately describe an investment s distribution of returns  In calculations of variance for  example the deviations around the mean are squared so we do not know whether large deviations are likely to be  positive or negative  We need to go beyond measures of central tendency and dispersion to reveal other important  characteristics of the distribution  One important characteristic of interest to analysts is the degree of symmetry in return  distributions 
9,479,If a return distribution is symmetrical about its mean then each side of the distribution is a mirror image of the other   Thus equal loss and gain intervals exhibit the same frequencies  Losses from    percent to    percent for example  occur with about the same frequency as gains from   percent to   percent 
10,479,One of the most important distributions is the normal distribution depicted in Figure    This symmetrical bell shaped  distribution plays a central role in the mean variance model of portfolio selection  it is also used extensively in financial  risk management  The normal distribution has the following characteristics 
11,479,  Its mean and median are equal 
12,479,  It is completely described by two parameters its mean and variance 
13,479,  Roughly    percent of its observations lie between plus and minus one standard deviation from the mean      percent lie between plus and minus two standard deviations  and    percent lie between plus and minus three  standard deviations 
14,479,A distribution that is not symmetrical is called skewed  A return distribution with positive skew has frequent small  losses and a few extreme gains  A return distribution with negative skew has frequent small gains and a few extreme  losses  Figure   shows continuous positively and negatively skewed distributions  The continuous positively skewed  distribution shown has a long tail on its right side  the continuous negatively skewed distribution shown has a long tail on  its left side  For the continuous positively skewed unimodal distribution the mode is less than the median which is less  than the mean  For the continuous negatively skewed unimodal distribution the mean is less than the median which is  less than the mode    Investors should be attracted by a positive skew because the mean return falls above the median   Relative to the mean return positive skew amounts to a limited though frequent downside compared with a somewhat  unlimited but less frequent upside

4,481,Skewness is the name given to a statistical measure of skew   The word  skewness  is also sometimes used  interchangeably for  skew    Like variance skewness is computed using each observation s deviation from its mean   Skewness  sometimes referred to as relative skewness  is computed as the average cubed deviation from the mean  standardized by dividing by the standard deviation cubed to make the measure free of scale    A symmetric distribution  has skewness of   a positively skewed distribution has positive skewness and a negatively skewed distribution has  negative skewness as given by this measure 
5,481,We can illustrate the principle behind the measure by focusing on the numerator  Cubing unlike squaring preserves the  sign of the deviations from the mean  If a distribution is positively skewed with a mean greater than its median then  more than half of the deviations from the mean are negative and less than half are positive  In order for the sum to be  positive the losses must be small and likely and the gains less likely but more extreme  Therefore if skewness is  positive the average magnitude of positive deviations is larger than the average magnitude of negative deviations 
6,481,A simple example illustrates that a symmetrical distribution has a skewness measure equal to    Suppose we have the  following data                  and    The mean outcome is   and the deviations are                     and     Cubing the deviations yields                        and    with a sum of    The numerator of skewness  and so  skewness itself  is thus equal to   supporting our claim  Below we give the formula for computing skewness from a  sample

7,482,Table    reveals that S P     annual returns during this period were negatively skewed while monthly returns were  positively skewed and the magnitude of skewness was greater for the annual series  We would find for other market  series that the shape of the distribution of returns often depends on the holding period examined 
8,482,Some researchers believe that investors should prefer positive skewness all else equal that is they should prefer  portfolios with distributions offering a relatively large frequency of unusually large payoffs    Different investment  strategies may tend to introduce different types and amounts of skewness into returns  Example    illustrates the  calculation of skewness for a managed portfolio

20,483,Based on this small sample the distribution of annual returns for the fund appears to be negatively skewed  In this  example four deviations are negative and six are positive  While there are more positive deviations they are  much more than offset by a huge negative deviation in      when the stock markets sharply went down as a  consequence of the global financial crisis  The result is that skewness is a negative number implying that the  distribution is skewed to the left 
21,483,   KURTOSIS IN RETURN DISTRIBUTIONS
22,483,In the previous section we discussed how to determine whether a return distribution deviates from a normal distribution  because of skewness  One other way in which a return distribution might differ from a normal distribution is its relative  tendency to generate large deviations from the mean  Most investors would perceive a greater chance of extremely large  deviations from the mean as increasing risk 
23,483,Kurtosis is a measure of the combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution that is  the proportion of the total probability that is in the tails  A distribution that has fatter tails than the normal distribution is  called leptokurtic  a distribution that has thinner tails than the normal distribution is called platykurtic  and a  distribution identical to the normal distribution as concerns relative weight in the tails is called mesokurtic  A  leptokurtic distribution tends to generate more frequent extremely large deviations from the mean than the normal  distribution

2,484,Figure   illustrates a leptokurtic distribution  It has fatter tails than the normal distribution  By construction the  leptokurtic and normal distributions have the same mean standard deviation and skewness  Note that the leptokurtic  distribution is more likely than the normal distribution to generate observations in the tail regions defined by the  intersection of graphs near a standard deviation of about       The leptokurtic distribution is also more likely to generate  observations that are near the mean defined here as the region    standard deviation around the mean  In compensation  to have probabilities sum to   the leptokurtic distribution generates fewer observations in the regions between the central  region and the two tail regions

5,484,The calculation for kurtosis involves finding the average of deviations from the mean raised to the fourth power and then  standardizing that average by dividing by the standard deviation raised to the fourth power    For all normal  distributions kurtosis is equal to    Many statistical packages report estimates of excess kurtosis which is kurtosis  minus      Excess kurtosis thus characterizes kurtosis relative to the normal distribution  A normal or other mesokurtic  distribution has excess kurtosis equal to    A leptokurtic distribution has excess kurtosis greater than   and a platykurtic  distribution has excess kurtosis less than    A return distribution with positive excess kurtosis a leptokurtic return  distribution has more frequent extremely large deviations from the mean than a normal distribution  Below is the  expression for computing kurtosis from a sample

14,485,Most equity return series have been found to be leptokurtic  If a return distribution has positive excess kurtosis   leptokurtosis  and we use statistical models that do not account for the fatter tails we will underestimate the likelihood  of very bad or very good outcomes  For example the return on the S P     for    October      was    standard  deviations away from the mean daily return  Such an outcome is possible with a normal distribution but its likelihood is  almost equal to    If daily returns are drawn from a normal distribution a return four standard deviations or more away  from the mean is expected once every    years  a return greater than five standard deviations away is expected once  every      years  The return for October      is more likely to have come from a distribution that had fatter tails than  from a normal distribution  Looking at Table    given earlier the monthly return series for the S P     has very large  excess kurtosis approximately      It is extremely fat tailed relative to the normal distribution  By contrast the annual  return series has about no excess kurtosis  The results for excess kurtosis in the table are consistent with research findings  that the normal distribution is a better approximation for US equity returns for annual holding periods than for shorter  ones  such as monthly

2,487,    USING GEOMETRIC AND ARITHMETIC MEANS
3,487,With the concepts of descriptive statistics in hand we will see why the geometric mean is appropriate for making  investment statements about past performance  We will also explore why the arithmetic mean is appropriate for making  investment statements in a forward looking context 
4,487,For reporting historical returns the geometric mean has considerable appeal because it is the rate of growth or return we  would have had to earn each year to match the actual cumulative investment performance  In our simplified Example    for instance we purchased a stock for      and two years later it was worth      with an intervening year at       The  geometric mean of   percent is clearly the compound rate of growth during the two years  Specifically the ending  amount is the beginning amount times      RG    The geometric mean is an excellent measure of past performance 
5,487,Example   illustrated how the arithmetic mean can distort our assessment of historical performance  In that example the  total performance for the two year period was unambiguously   percent  With a     percent return for the first year and      percent for the second however the arithmetic mean was    percent  As we noted previously the arithmetic mean is  always greater than or equal to the geometric mean  If we want to estimate the average return over a one period horizon  we should use the arithmetic mean because the arithmetic mean is the average of one period returns  If we want to  estimate the average returns over more than one period however we should use the geometric mean of returns because  the geometric mean captures how the total returns are linked over time 
6,487,As a corollary to using the geometric mean for performance reporting the use of semilogarithmic rather than arithmetic  scales is more appropriate when graphing past performance    In the context of reporting performance a  semilogarithmic graph has an arithmetic scale on the horizontal axis for time and a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis  for the value of the investment  The vertical axis values are spaced according to the differences between their logarithms   Suppose we want to represent             and       as values of an investment on the vertical axis  Note that each  successive value represents a    fold increase over the previous value and each will be equally spaced on the vertical  axis because the difference in their logarithms is roughly       that is ln      ln     ln       ln      ln        ln              On a semilogarithmic scale equal movements on the vertical axis reflect equal percentage changes and growth at a  constant compound rate plots as a straight line  A plot curving upward reflects increasing growth rates over time  The  slopes of a plot at different points may be compared in order to judge relative growth rates 
7,487,In addition to reporting historical performance financial analysts need to calculate expected equity risk premiums in a  forward looking context  For this purpose the arithmetic mean is appropriate 
8,487,We can illustrate the use of the arithmetic mean in a forward looking context with an example based on an investment s  future cash flows  In contrasting the geometric and arithmetic means for discounting future cash flows the essential issue  concerns uncertainty  Suppose an investor with         faces an equal chance of a     percent return or a     percent  return represented on the tree diagram as a       chance of a     percent return or a     percent return per period  With      percent return in one period and     percent return in the other the geometric mean return is                  
9,487,The geometric mean return of   percent gives the mode or median of ending wealth after two periods and thus accurately  predicts the modal or median ending wealth of         in this example  Nevertheless the arithmetic mean return better  predicts the arithmetic mean ending wealth  With equal chances of     percent or     percent returns consider the four  equally likely outcomes of                         and        as if they actually occurred  The arithmetic mean  ending wealth would be                                                     The actual returns would be      percent   percent   percent and     percent for a two period arithmetic mean return of                              percent  This arithmetic mean return predicts the arithmetic mean ending wealth of                              Noting that       percent for two periods is    percent per period we then must discount the expected terminal wealth of          at the    percent arithmetic mean rate to reflect the uncertainty in the cash flows

2,488,Uncertainty in cash flows or returns causes the arithmetic mean to be larger than the geometric mean  The more uncertain  the returns the more divergence exists between the arithmetic and geometric means  The geometric mean return  approximately equals the arithmetic return minus half the variance of return    Zero variance or zero uncertainty in  returns would leave the geometric and arithmetic return approximately equal but real world uncertainty presents an  arithmetic mean return larger than the geometric  For example for the nominal annual returns on S P     from      to       Table    reports an arithmetic mean of       percent and standard deviation of       percent  The geometric  mean of these returns is      percent  We can see the geometric mean is approximately the arithmetic mean minus half of  the variance of returns  RG                                    or      percent 
3,488,SUMMARY
4,488,In this reading we have presented descriptive statistics the set of methods that permit us to convert raw data into useful  information for investment analysis 
5,488,  A population is defined as all members of a specified group  A sample is a subset of a population 
6,488,  A parameter is any descriptive measure of a population  A sample statistic  statistic for short  is a quantity  computed from or used to describe a sample 
7,488,  Data measurements are taken using one of four major scales  nominal ordinal interval or ratio  Nominal scales  categorize data but do not rank them  Ordinal scales sort data into categories that are ordered with respect to some  characteristic  Interval scales provide not only ranking but also assurance that the differences between scale values  are equal  Ratio scales have all the characteristics of interval scales as well as a true zero point as the origin  The  scale on which data are measured determines the type of analysis that can be performed on the data 
8,488,  A frequency distribution is a tabular display of data summarized into a relatively small number of intervals   Frequency distributions permit us to evaluate how data are distributed 
9,488,  The relative frequency of observations in an interval is the number of observations in the interval divided by the  total number of observations  The cumulative relative frequency cumulates  adds up  the relative frequencies as we  move from the first interval to the last thus giving the fraction of the observations that are less than the upper limit  of each interval 
10,488,  A histogram is a bar chart of data that have been grouped into a frequency distribution  A frequency polygon is a  graph of frequency distributions obtained by drawing straight lines joining successive points representing the class  frequencies 
11,488,  Sample statistics such as measures of central tendency measures of dispersion skewness and kurtosis help with  investment analysis particularly in making probabilistic statements about returns 
12,488,  Measures of central tendency specify where data are centered and include the  arithmetic  mean median and mode   most frequently occurring value   The mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations   The median is the value of the middle item  or the mean of the values of the two middle items  when the items in a  set are sorted into ascending or descending order  The mean is the most frequently used measure of central  tendency  The median is not influenced by extreme values and is most useful in the case of skewed distributions   The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data 
13,488,  A portfolio s return is a weighted mean return computed from the returns on the individual assets where the  weight applied to each asset s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset 
14,488,  The geometric mean G of a set of observations X  X    Xn is G   n X X X    Xn with Xi     for i          n  The geometric mean is especially important in reporting compound growth rates for time series data 
15,488,  Quantiles such as the median quartiles quintiles deciles and percentiles are location parameters that divide a  distribution into halves quarters fifths tenths and hundredths respectively 
16,488,  Dispersion measures such as the variance standard deviation and mean absolute deviation  MAD  describe the  variability of outcomes around the arithmetic mean 
17,488,  Range is defined as the maximum value minus the minimum value  Range has only a limited scope because it uses  information from only two observations

9,489,  The variance is the average of the squared deviations around the mean and the standard deviation is the positive  square root of variance  In computing sample variance  s   and sample standard deviation the average squared  deviation is computed using a divisor equal to the sample size minus   
10,489,  The semivariance is the average squared deviation below the mean  semideviation is the positive square root of  semivariance  Target semivariance is the average squared deviation below a target level  target semideviation is its  positive square root  All these measures quantify downside risk 
11,489,  According to Chebyshev s inequality the proportion of the observations within k standard deviations of the  arithmetic mean is at least       k  for all k      Chebyshev s inequality permits us to make probabilistic statements  about the proportion of observations within various intervals around the mean for any distribution with finite  variance  As a result of Chebyshev s inequality a two standard deviation interval around the mean must contain at  least    percent of the observations and a three standard deviation interval around the mean must contain at least     percent of the observations no matter how the data are distributed 
12,489,  The coefficient of variation CV is the ratio of the standard deviation of a set of observations to their mean value   A scale free measure of relative dispersion by expressing the magnitude of variation among observations relative  to their average size the CV permits direct comparisons of dispersion across different data sets 
13,489,  The Sharpe ratio for a portfolio p based on historical returns is defined as Sh    where    R p is the mean  return to the portfolio    R F is the mean return to a risk free and asset and sp is the standard deviation of return on  the portfolio

16,489,  Skew describes the degree to which a distribution is not symmetric about its mean  A return distribution with  positive skewness has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains  A return distribution with negative skewness  has frequent small gains and a few extreme losses  Zero skewness indicates a symmetric distribution of returns 
17,489,  Kurtosis measures combined weight of the tails of a distribution relative to the rest of the distribution   Distributions are characterized as leptokurtic mesokurtic or platykurtic according to whether there is relatively  more the same or less weight in the tails  The calculation for kurtosis involves finding the average of deviations  from the mean raised to the fourth power and then standardizing that average by the standard deviation raised to  the fourth power  Excess kurtosis is kurtosis minus   the value of kurtosis for all normal distributions

12,496,   B is correct  The FTSE Eurotop     represents a sample of all European stocks  It is a subset of the population of  all European stocks 
13,496,   A is correct  Ordinal scales sort data into categories that are ordered with respect to some characteristic and may  involve numbers to identify categories but do not assure that the differences between scale values are equal  The  buy rating scale indicates that a stock ranked   is expected to perform better than a stock ranked   but it tells us  nothing about the performance difference between stocks ranked   and   compared with the performance  difference between stocks ranked   and   and so on 
14,496,   A is correct  Any descriptive measure of a population characteristic is referred to as a parameter 
15,496,   A is correct  The relative frequency is the absolute frequency of each interval divided by the total number of  observations  Here the relative frequency is calculated as                       B is incorrect because the relative  frequency of this interval is                         C is incorrect because the cumulative relative frequency of  the last interval must equal      
16,496,   C is correct  The cumulative relative frequency of an interval identifies the fraction of observations that are less  than the upper limit of the given interval  It is determined by summing the relative frequencies from the lowest  interval up to and including the given interval  The following table shows the relative frequencies for all the  intervals of the data from the previous table

22,496,The interval          x         has a cumulative relative frequency of       
23,496,   C is correct  Because there are    data points in the histogram the median return would be the mean of the           th and                th positions  The sum of the return interval frequencies to the left of the     to      interval is     As a result the   th and   th returns will fall in the     to     interval 
24,496,   C is correct  The mode of a distribution with data grouped in intervals is the interval with the highest frequency   The three intervals of    to        to     and     to     all have a high frequency of   
25,496,   A is correct  Twenty observations lie in the interval      to      and six observations lie in the     to     interval   Together they represent       or        of all observations which is more than

19,498,Fund ABC Fund XYZ Fund PQR                        
20,498,Range Variance
21,498,The numbers shown for variance are understood to be in  percent squared  terms so that when taking the square  root the result is standard deviation in percentage terms  Alternatively by expressing standard deviation and  variance in decimal form one can avoid the issue of units  in decimal form the variances for Fund ABC Fund  XYZ and Fund PQR are               and        respectively 
22,498,    C is correct  According to Chebyshev s inequality the proportion of the observations within k standard deviations  of the arithmetic mean is at least       k  for all k     
23,498,The upper limit of the range is       which is                     above the mean  The lower limit is        which is                        below the mean  As a result k                    standard deviations 
24,498,Because k        the proportion of observations within the interval is at least                                or         Thus the number of observations in the given range is at least             which is

2,499,    B is correct  The Sharpe ratio measures a portfolio s return per unit of risk and is defined as S     where     R p is the mean return for the portfolio    R F is the mean return to a risk free asset and sp is the standard deviation  of return on the portfolio  The Sharpe ratios for the three portfolios are as follows

8,499,So Portfolio   has the highest return per unit of risk 
9,499,    B is correct  Portfolio   has a skewness of     which indicates that the portfolio s return distribution is  symmetrical and thus its mean and median are equal 
10,499,    B is correct  Portfolio   has positive excess kurtosis  i e  kurtosis greater than    which indicates that its return  distribution is leptokurtic and has fatter tails than the normal  The fatter tails mean Portfolio   has a greater number  of extreme returns 
11,499,    A is correct  Portfolio   is positively skewed so the mean is greater than the median which is greater than the  mode 
12,499,    B is correct  The geometric mean compounds the periodic returns of every period giving the investor a more  accurate measure of the terminal value of an investment

16,499, Credit ratings for a bond issue gauge the bond issuer s ability to meet the promised principal and interest payments on the bond  For example  one rating agency Standard   Poor s assigns bond issues to one of the following ratings given in descending order of credit quality  increasing  probability of default   AAA AA  AA AA  A  A A  BBB  BBB BBB  BB  BB BB  B  B B  CCC  CCC  CC C D  For more  information on credit risk and credit ratings see the Level I CFA Program curriculum reading  Fixed Income Securities  Defining Elements  
17,499,  Hedge fund  refers to investment vehicles with legal structures that result in less regulatory oversight than other pooled investment vehicles  such as mutual funds  Hedge fund classification types group hedge funds by the kind of investment strategy they pursue 
18,499, Note however that if price and cash distributions in the expression for holding period return were not in one s home currency one would  generally convert those variables to one s home currency before calculating the holding period return  Because of exchange rate fluctuations  during the holding period holding period returns on an asset computed in different currencies would generally differ 
19,499, We use the total return series on the S P     from January      to December      provided by Ibbotson Associates 
20,499, Intervals are also sometimes called classes ranges or bins 
21,499, The notation        to        means         observation          In this context a square bracket indicates that the endpoint is included in the  interval 
22,499, The average or arithmetic mean of a set of values equals the sum of the values divided by the number of values summed  To find the arithmetic  mean of     annual returns for example we sum the     annual returns and then divide the total by      Among the most familiar of statistical  concepts the arithmetic mean is explained in more detail later in the reading 
23,499,  Even though the upper limit on the interval is not a return falling in the interval we still average it with the lower limit to determine the  midpoint

2,500,  Other approaches to handling extreme values involve variations of the arithmetic mean  The trimmed mean is computed by excluding a  stated small percentage of the lowest and highest values and then computing an arithmetic mean of the remaining values  For example a    percent trimmed mean discards the lowest     percent and the largest     percent of values and computes the mean of the remaining    percent of  values  A trimmed mean is used in sports competitions when judges  lowest and highest scores are discarded in computing a contestant s score  A  Winsorized mean assigns a stated percent of the lowest values equal to one specified low value and a stated percent of the highest values equal  to one specified high value then computes a mean from the restated data  For example a    percent Winsorized mean sets the bottom     percent  of values equal to the    th percentile value and the upper     percent of values equal to the     th percentile value   Percentile values are defined  later  
3,500,  The notation Md is occasionally used for the median  Just as for the mean we may distinguish between a population median and a sample  median  With the understanding that a population median divides a population in half while a sample median divides a sample in half we follow  general usage in using the term  median  without qualification for the sake of brevity 
4,500,  For more information on price multiples see the Level I CFA Program curriculum reading  Equity Valuation  Concepts and Basic Tools  
5,500,  The notation Mo is occasionally used for the mode  Just as for the mean and the median we may distinguish between a population mode and a  sample mode  With the understanding that a population mode is the value with the greatest probability of occurrence while a sample mode is the  most frequently occurring value in the sample we follow general usage in using the term  mode  without qualification for the sake of brevity 
6,500,  For more information on credit risk and credit ratings see Petitt Pinto and Pirie        
7,500,  The formula for the weighted mean can be compared to the formula for the arithmetic mean  For a set of observations X  X    Xn let the  weights w  w    wn all equal   n  Under this assumption the formula for the weighted mean is    n 
8,500,Xi   This is the formula for the
9,500,n 
10,500,i  
11,500,arithmetic mean  Therefore the arithmetic mean is a special case of the weighted mean in which all the weights are equal 
12,500,  In Table    strategic investments include investments in property private investments and hedge fund investments  Bond overlay consists of  derivatives used to hedge interest rate and inflation changes 
13,500,  This statement can be proved using Jensen s inequality that the average value of a function is less than or equal to the function evaluated at the  mean if the function is concave from below the case for ln X  
14,500,  For instance suppose the return for each of the three years is    percent  The arithmetic mean is    percent  To find the geometric mean we  first express the returns as      Rt  and then find the geometric mean                                     percent  The two means are the same 
15,500,  We will soon introduce standard deviation as a measure of variability  Holding the arithmetic mean return constant the geometric mean return  decreases for an increase in standard deviation 
16,500,  We will introduce formal measures of variability later  But note for example the       percentage point swing in returns between      and       for SLASX versus the       percentage point for PRFDX  Similarly note the       percentage point swing in returns between      and       for SLASX versus the       percentage point for PRFDX 
17,500,  The terminology  harmonic  arises from its use relative to a type of series involving reciprocals known as a harmonic series 
18,500,  Black        
19,500,  Another distance measure of dispersion that we may encounter the interquartile range focuses on the middle rather than the extremes  The  interquartile range  IQR  is the difference between the third and first quartiles of a data set  IQR   Q    Q   The IQR represents the length of  the interval containing the middle    percent of the data with a larger interquartile range indicating greater dispersion all else equal

21,500,  Forbes magazine annually selects US equity mutual funds meeting certain criteria for its Honor Roll  The criteria relate to capital preservation   performance in bear markets  continuity of management  the fund must have a manager with at least six years  tenure  diversification  accessibility  disqualifying funds that are closed to new investors  and after tax long term performance 
22,500,  In fact we could not properly use the Honor Roll funds to estimate the population variance of portfolio turnover  for example  of any other  differently defined population because the Honor Roll funds are not a random sample from any larger population of US equity mutual funds 
23,500,  We discuss this concept further in the reading on sampling 
24,500,  This is an informal treatment of these two measures  see the survey article by N  Fred Choobinbeh        for a rigorous treatment 
25,500,  We discuss skewness later in this reading 
26,500,  As discussed in the reading on probability concepts and the various readings on portfolio concepts we can find a portfolio s variance as a  straightforward function of the variances and correlations of the component securities  There is no similar procedure for semivariance and target  semivariance  We also cannot take the derivative of semivariance or target semivariance 
27,500,  The second sample was created by adding      million to each observation in the first sample  Standard deviation  and variance  has the  property of remaining unchanged if we add a constant amount to each observation

2,501,  The reader will also encounter CV defined as     s     X   which states CV as a percentage 
3,501,  The equation presents the ex post or historical Sharpe ratio  We can also think of the Sharpe ratio for a portfolio going forward based on our  expectations for mean return the risk free return and the standard deviation of return  this would be the ex ante Sharpe ratio  One may also  encounter an alternative calculation for the Sharpe ratio in which the denominator is the standard deviation of the series  Portfolio return   Risk  free return  rather than the standard deviation of portfolio return  in practice the two standard deviation calculations generally yield very similar  results  For more information on the Sharpe ratio  which has also been called the Sharpe measure the reward to variability ratio and the excess  return to variability measure  see Elton Gruber Brown and Goetzmann        and Sharpe        
4,501,  If the standard deviations are equal however the portfolio with the negative Sharpe ratio closer to zero is superior

7,501,  As a mnemonic in this case the mean median and mode occur in the same order as they would be listed in a dictionary  Von Hippel        explores exceptions to the relationships among these measures for distributions that vary from those shown in Figure   
8,501,  We are discussing a moment coefficient of skewness  Some textbooks present the Pearson coefficient of skewness equal to   Mean    Median  Standard deviation which has the drawback of involving the calculation of the median

15,501,  It is useful to know that we can conduct a Jarque Bera  JB  statistical test of normality based on sample size n sample skewness and sample  excess kurtosis  We can conclude that a distribution is not normal with no more than a   percent chance of being wrong if the quantity  E       is   or greater for a sample with at least    observations  In this mutual fund example we have only     observations and the test described is only correct based on large samples  as a guideline for n        Gujarati Porter and Gunasekar        provides more details on this test

5,503,   INTRODUCTION
6,503,All investment decisions are made in an environment of risk  The tools that allow us to make  decisions with consistency and logic in this setting come under the heading of probability  This  reading presents the essential probability tools needed to frame and address many real world  problems involving risk  We illustrate how these tools apply to such issues as predicting  investment manager performance forecasting financial variables and pricing bonds so that they  fairly compensate bondholders for default risk  Our focus is practical  We explore in detail the  concepts that are most important to investment research and practice  One such concept is  independence as it relates to the predictability of returns and financial variables  Another is  expectation as analysts continually look to the future in their analyses and decisions  Analysts  and investors must also cope with variability  We present variance or dispersion around  expectation as a risk concept important in investments  The reader will acquire specific skills in  using portfolio expected return and variance 
7,503,The basic tools of probability including expected value and variance are set out in Section   of  this reading  Section   introduces covariance and correlation  measures of relatedness between  random quantities  and the principles for calculating portfolio expected return and variance   Two topics end the reading  Bayes  formula and outcome counting  Bayes  formula is a  procedure for updating beliefs based on new information  In several areas including a widely  used option pricing model the calculation of probabilities involves defining and counting  outcomes  The reading ends with a discussion of principles and shortcuts for counting 
8,503,   PROBABILITY EXPECTED VALUE AND  VARIANCE
9,503,The probability concepts and tools necessary for most of an analyst s work are relatively few  and simple but require thought to apply  This section presents the essentials for working with  probability expectation and variance drawing on examples from equity and fixed income  analysis

2,504,An investor s concerns center on returns  The return on a risky asset is an example of a random  variable a quantity whose outcomes  possible values  are uncertain  For example a portfolio  may have a return objective of    percent a year  The portfolio manager s focus at the moment  may be on the likelihood of earning a return that is less than    percent over the next year  Ten  percent is a particular value or outcome of the random variable  portfolio return   Although we  may be concerned about a single outcome frequently our interest may be in a set of outcomes   The concept of  event  covers both 
3,504,  Definition of Event  An event is a specified set of outcomes 
4,504,We may specify an event to be a single outcome for example the portfolio earns a return of     percent   We use italics to highlight statements that define events   We can capture the  portfolio manager s concerns by defining the event as the portfolio earns a return below     percent  This second event referring as it does to all possible returns greater than or equal to       percent  the worst possible return  but less than    percent contains an infinite number of  outcomes  To save words it is common to use a capital letter in italics to represent a defined  event  We could define A   the portfolio earns a return of    percent and B   the portfolio  earns a return below    percent 
5,504,To return to the portfolio manager s concern how likely is it that the portfolio will earn a return  below    percent 
6,504,The answer to this question is a probability  a number between   and   that measures the  chance that a stated event will occur  If the probability is      that the portfolio earns a return  below    percent there is a    percent chance of that event happening  If an event is  impossible it has a probability of    If an event is certain to happen it has a probability of    If  an event is impossible or a sure thing it is not random at all  So   and   bracket all the possible  values of a probability 
7,504,Probability has two properties which together constitute its definition 
8,504,  Definition of Probability  The two defining properties of a probability are as follows 
9,504,   The probability of any event E is a number between   and        P E      
10,504,   The sum of the probabilities of any set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events equals   
11,504,P followed by parentheses stands for  the probability of  the event in parentheses   as in P E   for  the probability of event E   We can also think of P as a rule or function that assigns  numerical values to events consistent with Properties   and   
12,504,In the above definition the term mutually exclusive means that only one event can occur at a  time  exhaustive means that the events cover all possible outcomes  The events A   the  portfolio earns a return of    percent and B   the portfolio earns a return below    percent are  mutually exclusive because A and B cannot both occur at the same time  For example a return  of     percent means that B has occurred and A has not occurred  Although events A and B are  mutually exclusive they are not exhaustive because they do not cover outcomes such as a return  of    percent  Suppose we define a third event  C   the portfolio earns a return above     percent  Clearly A B and C are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events  Each of P A  P B   and P C  is a number between   and   and P A    P B    P C

2,505,The most basic kind of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events is the set of all the distinct  possible outcomes of the random variable  If we know both that set and the assignment of  probabilities to those outcomes the probability distribution of the random variable we have a  complete description of the random variable and we can assign a probability to any event that  we might describe   The probability of any event is the sum of the probabilities of the distinct  outcomes included in the definition of the event  Suppose the event of interest is D   the  portfolio earns a return above the risk free rate and we know the probability distribution of  portfolio returns  Assume the risk free rate is   percent  To calculate P D  the probability of D we would sum the probabilities of the outcomes that satisfy the definition of the event  that is  we would sum the probabilities of portfolio returns greater than   percent 
3,505,Earlier to illustrate a concept we assumed a probability of      for a portfolio earning less than     percent without justifying the particular assumption  We also talked about using a  probability distribution of outcomes to calculate the probability of events without explaining  how a probability distribution might be estimated  Making actual financial decisions using  inaccurate probabilities might have grave consequences  How in practice do we estimate  probabilities  This topic is a field of study in itself but there are three broad approaches to  estimating probabilities  In investments we often estimate the probability of an event as a  relative frequency of occurrence based on historical data  This method produces an empirical  probability  For example Thanatawee        reports that of his sample of      yearly  observations for nonfinancial SET  Stock Exchange of Thailand  firms during the years      to            were dividend paying firms and     were non dividend paying firms  The  empirical probability of a Thai firm paying a dividend is thus                   approximately  We will point out empirical probabilities in several places as they appear in this  reading 
4,505,Relationships must be stable through time for empirical probabilities to be accurate  We cannot  calculate an empirical probability of an event not in the historical record or a reliable empirical  probability for a very rare event  There are cases then in which we may adjust an empirical  probability to account for perceptions of changing relationships  In other cases we have no  empirical probability to use at all  We may also make a personal assessment of probability  without reference to any particular data  Each of these three types of probability is a subjective  probability one drawing on personal or subjective judgment  Subjective probabilities are of  great importance in investments  Investors in making buy and sell decisions that determine  asset prices often draw on subjective probabilities  Subjective probabilities appear in various  places in this reading notably in our discussion of Bayes  formula 
5,505,In a more narrow range of well defined problems we can sometimes deduce probabilities by  reasoning about the problem  The resulting probability is an a priori probability one based on  logical analysis rather than on observation or personal judgment  We will use this type of  probability in Example    The counting methods we discuss later are particularly important in  calculating an a priori probability  Because a priori and empirical probabilities generally do not  vary from person to person they are often grouped as objective probabilities 
6,505,In business and elsewhere we often encounter probabilities stated in terms of odds for  instance  the odds for E  or the  odds against E   For example as of November      analysts   fiscal year      EPS forecasts for JetBlue Airways ranged from       to        Suppose one  analyst asserts that the odds for the company beating the highest estimate       are   to     Suppose a second analyst argues that the odds against that happening are    to    What do those  statements imply about the probability of the company s EPS beating the highest estimate  We  interpret probabilities stated in terms of odds as follows 
7,505,  Probability Stated as Odds  Given a probability P E

2,506,   Odds for E   P E       P E    The odds for E are the probability of E divided by    minus the probability of E  Given odds for E of  a to b  the implied probability of  E is a  a   b  
3,506,In the example the statement that the odds for the company s EPS for FY     beating       are   to   means that the speaker believes the probability of the event is                         
4,506,   Odds against E        P E   P E  the reciprocal of odds for E  Given odds against  E of  a to b  the implied probability of E is b  a   b  
5,506,The statement that the odds against the company s EPS for FY     beating       are    to   is  consistent with a belief that the probability of the event is                            
6,506,To further explain odds for an event if P E        the odds for E are                                 or    to     For each occurrence of E we expect seven cases of non occurrence  out of  eight cases in total therefore we expect E to happen once and the probability of E is      In  wagering it is common to speak in terms of the odds against something as in Statement    For  odds of     to    against E  an implied probability of E of       a    wager on E if successful  returns     in profits plus the    staked in the wager  We can calculate the bet s anticipated  profit as follows 
7,506,Win  Probability         Profit      Loss  Probability          Profit      Anticipated profit                                  
8,506,Weighting each of the wager s two outcomes by the respective probability of the outcome if  the odds  probabilities  are accurate the anticipated profit of the bet is    
9,506,EXAMPLE  
10,506,Profiting from Inconsistent Probabilities
11,506,You are examining the common stock of two companies in the same industry in which  an important antitrust decision will be announced next week  The first company  SmithCo Corporation will benefit from a governmental decision that there is no  antitrust obstacle related to a merger in which it is involved  You believe that SmithCo s  share price reflects a      probability of such a decision  A second company Selbert  Corporation will equally benefit from a  go ahead  ruling  Surprisingly you believe  Selbert stock reflects only a      probability of a favorable decision  Assuming your  analysis is correct what investment strategy would profit from this pricing discrepancy 
12,506,Consider the logical possibilities  One is that the probability of      reflected in  Selbert s share price is accurate  In that case Selbert is fairly valued but SmithCo is  overvalued as its current share price overestimates the probability of a  go ahead   decision  The second possibility is that the probability of      is accurate  In that case  SmithCo shares are fairly valued but Selbert shares which build in a lower probability  of a favorable decision are undervalued  You diagram the situation as shown in Table

2,507,True Probability of a  Go Ahead  Decision           SmithCo Shares Overvalued Shares Fairly Valued Selbert Shares Fairly Valued Shares Undervalued
3,507,The      probability column shows that Selbert shares are a better value than SmithCo  shares  Selbert shares are also a better value if a      probability is accurate  Thus  SmithCo shares are overvalued relative to Selbert shares 
4,507,Your investment actions depend on your confidence in your analysis and on any  investment constraints you face  such as constraints on selling stock short    A  conservative strategy would be to buy Selbert shares and reduce or eliminate any current  position in SmithCo  The most aggressive strategy is to short SmithCo stock  relatively  overvalued  and simultaneously buy the stock of Selbert  relatively undervalued   This  strategy is known as pairs arbitrage trade  a trade in two closely related stocks  involving the short sale of one and the purchase of the other 
5,507,The prices of SmithCo and Selbert shares reflect probabilities that are not consistent   According to one of the most important probability results for investments the Dutch  Book Theorem  inconsistent probabilities create profit opportunities  In our example  investors by their buy and sell decisions to exploit the inconsistent probabilities should  eliminate the profit opportunity and inconsistency 
6,507,To understand the meaning of a probability in investment contexts we need to distinguish  between two types of probability  unconditional and conditional  Both unconditional and  conditional probabilities satisfy the definition of probability stated earlier but they are  calculated or estimated differently and have different interpretations  They provide answers to  different questions 
7,507,The probability in answer to the straightforward question  What is the probability of this event  A   is an unconditional probability denoted P A   Unconditional probability is also  frequently referred to as marginal probability  
8,507,Suppose the question is  What is the probability that the stock earns a return above the risk free  rate  event A    The answer is an unconditional probability that can be viewed as the ratio of  two quantities  The numerator is the sum of the probabilities of stock returns above the risk free  rate  Suppose that sum is       The denominator is   the sum of the probabilities of all possible  returns  The answer to the question is P A         
9,507,Contrast the question  What is the probability of A   with the question  What is the probability  of A given that B has occurred   The probability in answer to this last question is a  conditional probability denoted P A   B   read   the probability of A given B

2,508,Suppose we want to know the probability that the stock earns a return above the risk free rate  event A  given that the stock earns a positive return  event B   With the words  given that   we are restricting returns to those larger than   percent a new element in contrast to the  question that brought forth an unconditional probability  The conditional probability is  calculated as the ratio of two quantities  The numerator is the sum of the probabilities of stock  returns above the risk free rate  in this particular case the numerator is the same as it was in the  unconditional case which we gave as       The denominator however changes from   to the  sum of the probabilities for all outcomes  returns  above   percent  Suppose that number is       a larger number than      because returns between   and the risk free rate have some  positive probability of occurring  Then P A   B                       If we observe that the  stock earns a positive return the probability of a return above the risk free rate is greater than  the unconditional probability which is the probability of the event given no other information   The result is intuitive   To review an unconditional probability is the probability of an event  without any restriction  it might even be thought of as a stand alone probability  A conditional  probability in contrast is a probability of an event given that another event has occurred 
3,508,In discussing approaches to calculating probability we gave one empirical estimate of the  probability that a change in dividends is a dividend decrease  That probability was an  unconditional probability  Given additional information on company characteristics could an  investor refine that estimate  Investors continually seek an information edge that will help  improve their forecasts  In mathematical terms they are attempting to frame their view of the  future using probabilities conditioned on relevant information or events  Investors do not ignore  useful information  they adjust their probabilities to reflect it  Thus the concepts of conditional  probability  which we analyze in more detail below  as well as related concepts discussed  further on are extremely important in investment analysis and financial markets 
4,508,To state an exact definition of conditional probability we first need to introduce the concept of  joint probability  Suppose we ask the question  What is the probability of both A and B happening   The answer to this question is a joint probability denoted P AB   read   the  probability of A and B    If we think of the probability of A and the probability of B as sets built  of the outcomes of one or more random variables the joint probability of A and B is the sum of  the probabilities of the outcomes they have in common  For example consider two events  the  stock earns a return above the risk free rate  A  and the stock earns a positive return  B   The  outcomes of A are contained within  a subset of  the outcomes of B so P AB  equals P A   We  can now state a formal definition of conditional probability that provides a formula for  calculating it 
5,508,  Definition of Conditional Probability  The conditional probability of A given that B has  occurred is equal to the joint probability of A and B divided by the probability of B  assumed not to equal    
6,508,Equation    
7,508,P A   B    P AB  P B  P B

2,511,When we have two events A and B that we are interested in we often want to know the  probability that either A or B occurs  Here the word  or  is inclusive meaning that either A or B occurs or that both A and B occur  Put another way the probability of A or B is the probability  that at least one of the two events occurs  Such probabilities are calculated using the addition
3,511,rule for probabilities 
4,511,  Addition Rule for Probabilities  Given events A and B the probability that A or B occurs or both occur is equal to the probability that A occurs plus the probability that B occurs minus the probability that both A and B occur

6,511,P A or B    P A    P B    P AB 
7,511,If we think of the individual probabilities of A and B as sets built of outcomes of one or more  random variables the first step in calculating the probability of A or B is to sum the  probabilities of the outcomes in A to obtain P A   If A and B share any outcomes then if we  now added P B  to P A  we would count twice the probabilities of those shared outcomes  So  we add to P A  the quantity  P B    P AB   which is the probability of outcomes in B net of the  probability of any outcomes already counted when we computed P A   Figure   illustrates this  process  we avoid double counting the outcomes in the intersection of A and B by subtracting P  AB   As an example of the calculation if P A         P B         and P AB         then P A or B                               Only if the two events A and B were mutually exclusive so  that P AB      would it be correct to state that P A or B    P A    P B

2,512,Probability of a Limit Order Executing
3,512,You have two buy limit orders outstanding on the same stock  A limit order to buy stock  at a stated price is an order to buy at that price or lower  A number of vendors including  an internet service that you use supply the estimated probability that a limit order will  be filled within a stated time horizon given the current stock price and the price limit   One buy order  Order    was placed at a price limit of      The probability that it will  execute within one hour is       The second buy order  Order    was placed at a price  limit of        it has a      probability of executing within the same one hour time  frame 
4,512,   What is the probability that either Order   or Order   will execute 
5,512,   What is the probability that Order   executes given that Order   executes 
6,512,Solution to   
7,512,The probability is       The two probabilities that are given are P Order   executes          and P Order   executes          Note that if Order   executes it is certain that  Order   also executes because the price must pass through     to reach        Thus
8,512,P Order   executes   Order   executes

10,512,P Order   executes and Order   executes    P Order   executes    Order   executes P Order   executes                  
11,512,To answer the question we use the addition rule for probabilities 
12,512,P Order   executes or Order   executes    P Order   executes     P Order   executes    P Order   executes and Order   executes                              
13,512,Note that the outcomes for which Order   executes are a subset of the outcomes for  which Order   executes  After you count the probability that Order   executes you have  counted the probability of the outcomes for which Order   also executes  Therefore the  answer to the question is the probability that Order   executes      
14,512,Solution to   
15,512,If the first order executes the probability that the second order executes is        In the  solution to Part   you found that P Order   executes and Order   executes    P Order    executes   Order   executes P Order   executes                    An equivalent way to  state this joint probability is useful here 
16,512,P Order   executes and Order   executes            P Order   executes   Order   executes P Order   executes

3,513,Of great interest to investment analysts are the concepts of independence and dependence   These concepts bear on such basic investment questions as which financial variables are useful  for investment analysis whether asset returns can be predicted and whether superior  investment managers can be selected based on their past records 
4,513,Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of  occurrence of the other event 
5,513,  Definition of Independent Events  Two events A and B are independent if and only if  P A   B    P A  or equivalently P B   A    P B  
6,513,When two events are not independent they are dependent  The probability of occurrence of  one is related to the occurrence of the other  If we are trying to forecast one event information  about a dependent event may be useful but information about an independent event will not be  useful 
7,513,When two events are independent the multiplication rule for probabilities Equation    simplifies because P A   B  in that equation then equals P A  
8,513,  Multiplication Rule for Independent Events  When two events are independent the  joint probability of A and B equals the product of the individual probabilities of A and B 
9,513,Equation    
10,513,P AB    P A P B 
11,513,Therefore if we are interested in two independent events with probabilities of      and       respectively the probability that both will occur is                     The multiplication rule  for independent events generalizes to more than two events  for example if A B and C are  independent events then P ABC    P A P B P C

13,513,BankCorp s Earnings per Share    
14,513,As part of your work as a banking industry analyst you build models for forecasting  earnings per share of the banks you cover  Today you are studying BankCorp  The  historical record shows that in    percent of recent quarters BankCorp s EPS has  increased sequentially and in    percent of quarters EPS has decreased or remained  unchanged sequentially   At this point in your analysis you are assuming that changes  in sequential EPS are independent

2,514,   What is the probability that EPS decreases or remains unchanged in the next two  quarters 
3,514,Solution to   
4,514,Under the assumption of independence the probability that  Q      EPS will be larger  than  Q      EPS is the unconditional probability of positive change       The fact  that  Q      EPS was larger than  Q      EPS is not useful information as the next  change in EPS is independent of the prior change 
5,514,Solution to   
6,514,The probability is                     
7,514,The following example illustrates how difficult it is to satisfy a set of independent criteria even  when each criterion by itself is not necessarily stringent 
8,514,EXAMPLE  
9,514,Screening Stocks for Investment
10,514,You have developed a stock screen a set of criteria for selecting stocks  Your  investment universe  the set of securities from which you make your choices  is the  Russell      Index an index of      large capitalization US equities  Your criteria  capture different aspects of the selection problem  you believe that the criteria are  independent of each other to a close approximation 
11,514,Criterion First valuation criterion Second valuation criterion Analyst coverage criterion Profitability criterion for company Financial strength criterion for  company

13,514,    
14,514,How many stocks do you expect to pass your screen 
15,514,Only    stocks out of      pass through your screen  If you define five events the  stock passes the first valuation criterion the stock passes the second valuation criterion  the stock passes the analyst coverage criterion the company passes the profitability  criterion the company passes the financial strength criterion  say events A B C D and  E respectively  then the probability that a stock will pass all five criteria under  independence is
16,514,P  ABCDE    P  A  P  B  P  C   P  D  P  E

2,515,Although only one of the five criteria is even moderately strict  the strictest lets     percent of stocks through  the probability that a stock can pass all five is only           or about   percent  The size of the list of candidate investments is                          or    stocks 
3,515,An area of intense interest to investment managers and their clients is whether records of past  performance are useful in identifying repeat winners and losers  The following example shows  how this issue relates to the concept of independence 
4,515,EXAMPLE  
5,515,Conditional Probabilities and Predictability  of Mutual Fund Performance    
6,515,The purpose of the Vidal Garcia        study introduced in Example   was to address  the question of repeat European mutual fund winners and losers  If the status of a fund  as a winner or a loser in one year is independent of whether it is a winner in the next  year the practical value of performance ranking is questionable  Using the four events  defined in Example   as building blocks we can define the following events to address  the issue of predictability of mutual fund performance 
7,515,Fund is a Year   winner and fund is a Year   winner Fund is a Year   winner and fund is a Year   loser Fund is a Year   loser and fund is a Year   winner Fund is a Year   loser and fund is a Year   loser
8,515,In Part   of Example   you calculated that
9,515,P fund is a Year   loser and fund is a Year   loser         
10,515,If the ranking in one year is independent of the ranking in the next year what will you  expect P fund is a Year   loser and fund is a Year   loser  to be  Interpret the empirical  probability

2,516,By the multiplication rule for independent events P fund is a Year   loser and fund is a  Year   loser    P fund is a Year   loser P fund is a Year   loser   Because    percent of  funds are categorized as losers in each year the unconditional probability that a fund is  labeled a loser in either year is       Thus P fund is a Year   loser P fund is a Year    loser                       If the status of a fund as a loser in one year is independent of  whether it is a loser in the prior year we conclude that P fund is a Year   loser and fund  is a Year   loser          This probability is a priori because it is obtained from  reasoning about the problem  You could also reason that the four events described above  define categories and that if funds are randomly assigned to the four categories there is  a     probability of fund is a Year   loser and fund is a Year   loser  If the  classifications in Year   and Year   were dependent then the assignment of funds to  categories would not be random  The empirical probability of       is above       Is  this apparent predictability the result of chance  A test conducted by Vidal Garcia  indicated a less than   percent chance of observing the tabled data if the Year   and  Year   rankings were independent 
3,516,In investments the question of whether one event  or characteristic  provides information about  another event  or characteristic  arises in both time series settings  through time  and cross  sectional settings  among units at a given point in time   Examples   and   examined  independence in a time series setting  Example   illustrated independence in a cross sectional  setting  Independence dependence relationships are often also explored in both settings using  regression analysis a technique we discuss in a later reading 
4,516,In many practical problems we logically analyze a problem as follows  We formulate scenarios  that we think affect the likelihood of an event that interests us  We then estimate the probability  of the event given the scenario  When the scenarios  conditioning events  are mutually  exclusive and exhaustive no possible outcomes are left out  We can then analyze the event  using the total probability rule  This rule explains the unconditional probability of the event in  terms of probabilities conditional on the scenarios 
5,516,The total probability rule is stated below for two cases  Equation   gives the simplest case in  which we have two scenarios  One new notation is introduced  If we have an event or scenario  S the event not S called the complement of S is written SC   Note that P S    P SC      as  either S or not S must occur  Equation   states the rule for the general case of n mutually  exclusive and exhaustive events or scenarios

2,517,Equation   states the following  The probability of any event  P A   can be expressed as a  weighted average of the probabilities of the event given scenarios  terms such P A   S     the  weights applied to these conditional probabilities are the respective probabilities of the  scenarios  terms such as P S   multiplying P A   S    and the scenarios must be mutually  exclusive and exhaustive  Among other applications this rule is needed to understand Bayes   formula which we discuss later in the reading 
3,517,In the next example we use the total probability rule to develop a consistent set of views about  BankCorp s earnings per share 
4,517,EXAMPLE  
5,517,BankCorp s Earnings per Share    
6,517,You are continuing your investigation into whether you can predict the direction of  changes in BankCorp s quarterly EPS  You define four events 
7,517,Event A   Change in sequential EPS is positive next quarter AC   Change in sequential EPS is   or negative next quarter S   Change in sequential EPS is positive in the prior quarter SC   Change in sequential EPS is   or negative in the prior quarter
8,517,Probability                    
9,517,On inspecting the data you observe some persistence in EPS changes  Increases tend to  be followed by increases and decreases by decreases  The first probability estimate you  develop is P change in sequential EPS is positive next quarter   change in sequential  EPS is   or negative in the prior quarter    P A   SC          The most recent quarter s  EPS   Q       is announced and the change is a positive sequential change  the event  S   You are interested in forecasting EPS for  Q      
10,517,   Write this statement in probability notation   the probability that the change in  sequential EPS is positive next quarter given that the change in sequential EPS is  positive the prior quarter  
11,517,   Calculate the probability in Part     Calculate the probability that is consistent  with your other probabilities or beliefs  
12,517,Solution to   
13,517,In probability notation this statement is written P A   S  
14,517,Solution to   
15,517,The probability is       that the change in sequential EPS is positive for  Q      given  the positive change in sequential EPS for  Q      as shown on the following page 
16,517,According to Equation   P A    P A   S P S    P A   SC P SC   The values of the  probabilities needed to calculate P A   S  are already known  P A         P S         P  SC         and P A   SC          Substituting into Equation

3,518,Solving for the unknown P A   S                                        or       
4,518,You conclude that P change in sequential EPS is positive next quarter   change in  sequential EPS is positive the prior quarter           Any other probability is not  consistent with your other estimated probabilities  Reflecting the persistence in EPS  changes this conditional probability of a positive EPS change       is greater than the  unconditional probability of an EPS increase      
5,518,In the reading on statistical concepts and market returns we discussed the concept of a  weighted average or weighted mean  The example highlighted in that reading was that portfolio  return is a weighted average of the returns on the individual assets in the portfolio where the  weight applied to each asset s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset  The  total probability rule which is a rule for stating an unconditional probability in terms of  conditional probabilities is also a weighted average  In that formula probabilities of scenarios  are used as weights  Part of the definition of weighted average is that the weights sum to    The  probabilities of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events do sum to    this is part of the  definition of probability   The next weighted average we discuss the expected value of a  random variable also uses probabilities as weights 
6,518,The expected value of a random variable is an essential quantitative concept in investments   Investors continually make use of expected values in estimating the rewards of alternative  investments in forecasting EPS and other corporate financial variables and ratios and in  assessing any other factor that may affect their financial position  The expected value of a  random variable is defined as follows 
7,518,  Definition of Expected Value  The expected value of a random variable is the  probability weighted average of the possible outcomes of the random variable  For a  random variable X the expected value of X is denoted E X  
8,518,Expected value  for example expected stock return  looks either to the future as a forecast or  to the  true  value of the mean  the population mean discussed in the reading on statistical  concepts and market returns   We should distinguish expected value from the concepts of  historical or sample mean  The sample mean also summarizes in a single number a central  value  However the sample mean presents a central value for a particular set of observations as  an equally weighted average of those observations  To summarize the contrast is forecast  versus historical or population versus sample

17,519,The expected value is our forecast  Because we are discussing random quantities we cannot  count on an individual forecast being realized  although we hope that on average forecasts will  be accurate   It is important as a result to measure the risk we face  Variance and standard  deviation measure the dispersion of outcomes around the expected value or forecast 
18,519,  Definition of Variance  The variance of a random variable is the expected value  the  probability weighted average  of squared deviations from the random variable s expected  value 
19,519,Equation    
20,519,     X    E   X   E  X

2,520,Variance is a number greater than or equal to   because it is the sum of squared terms  If  variance is   there is no dispersion or risk  The outcome is certain and the quantity X is not  random at all  Variance greater than   indicates dispersion of outcomes  Increasing variance  indicates increasing dispersion all else equal  Variance of X is a quantity in the squared units of  X  For example if the random variable is return in percent variance of return is in units of  percent squared  Standard deviation is easier to interpret than variance as it is in the same units  as the random variable  If the random variable is return in percent standard deviation of return  is also in units of percent  In the following example when the variance of returns is stated as a  percent or amount of money to conserve space the reading may suppress showing the unit  squared  Note that when the variance of returns is stated as a decimal the complication of  dealing with units of  percent squared  does not arise 
3,520,  Definition of Standard Deviation  Standard deviation is the positive square root of  variance 
4,520,The best way to become familiar with these concepts is to work examples 
5,520,EXAMPLE  
6,520,BankCorp s Earnings per Share

4,521,  EPS                           or approximately      
5,521,An equation that summarizes your calculation of variance in Example   is

13,521,In investments we make use of any relevant information available in making our forecasts   When we refine our expectations or forecasts we are typically making adjustments based on  new information or events  in these cases we are using conditional expected values  The  expected value of a random variable X given an event or scenario S is denoted E X   S   Suppose  the random variable X can take on any one of n distinct outcomes X  X    Xn  these outcomes  form a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events   The expected value of X conditional on  S is the first outcome X  times the probability of the first outcome given S P X    S  plus the  second outcome X  times the probability of the second outcome given S P X    S  and so  forth

16,521,We will illustrate this equation shortly

3,522,where S  S    Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios or events 
4,522,The general case Equation    states that the expected value of X equals the expected value of  X given Scenario   E X   S   times the probability of Scenario   P S   plus the expected value  of X given Scenario   E X   S   times the probability of Scenario   P S   and so forth 
5,522,To use this principle we formulate mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios that are useful  for understanding the outcomes of the random variable  This approach was employed in  developing the probability distribution of BankCorp s EPS in Examples   and   as we now  discuss 
6,522,The earnings of BankCorp are interest rate sensitive benefiting from a declining interest rate  environment  Suppose there is a      probability that BankCorp will operate in a declining  interest rate environment in the current fiscal year and a      probability that it will operate in a  stable interest rate environment  assessing the chance of an increasing interest rate environment  as negligible   If a declining interest rate environment occurs the probability that EPS will be        is estimated at      and the probability that EPS will be       is estimated at       Note  that      the probability of declining interest rate environment times      the probability of        EPS given a declining interest rate environment equals      the  unconditional   probability of       given in the table in Examples   and    The probabilities are consistent   Also                   the probability of       EPS given in Tables   and    The tree  diagram in Figure   shows the rest of the analysis 
7,522,Figure    BankCorp s Forecasted EPS
8,522,A declining interest rate environment points us to the node of the tree that branches off into  outcomes of       and        We can find expected EPS given a declining interest rate  environment as follows using Equation    
9,522,E EPS   declining interest rate environment

2,523,If interest rates are stable
3,523,E EPS   stable interest rate environment                             
4,523,       
5,523,Once we have the new piece of information that interest rates are stable for example we revise  our original expectation of EPS from       downward to        Now using the total probability  rule for expected value
6,523,E EPS    E EPS   declining interest rate environment P declining interest rate environment     E EPS   stable interest rate environment P stable interest rate environment 
7,523,So E EPS                                          or about       
8,523,This amount is identical to the estimate of the expected value of EPS calculated directly from  the probability distribution in Example    Just as our probabilities must be consistent so must  our expected values unconditional and conditional  otherwise our investment actions may  create profit opportunities for other investors at our expense 
9,523,To review we first developed the factors or scenarios that influence the outcome of the event of  interest  After assigning probabilities to these scenarios we formed expectations conditioned on  the different scenarios  Then we worked backward to formulate an expected value as of today   In the problem just worked EPS was the event of interest and the interest rate environment was  the factor influencing EPS 
10,523,We can also calculate the variance of EPS given each scenario 
11,523,     EPS declining interest rate environment    P        declining interest rate environment             E  EPS declining interest rate environment      P        declining interest rate environment             E  EPS declining interest rate environment   
12,523,                                                            
13,523,     EPS stable interest rate environment    P        stable interest rate environment             E  EPS stable interest rate environment      P        stable interest rate environment             E  EPS stable interest rate environment   
14,523,                                                      
15,523,These are conditional variances the variance of EPS given a declining interest rate  environment and the variance of EPS given a stable interest rate environment  The relationship  between unconditional variance and conditional variance is a relatively advanced topic   The  main points are    that variance like expected value has a conditional counterpart to the  unconditional concept and    that we can use conditional variance to assess risk given a  particular scenario

2,526,EXAMPLE   
3,526,The Default Risk Premium for a One Period  Debt Instrument
4,526,As the co manager of a short term bond portfolio you are reviewing the pricing of a  speculative grade one year maturity zero coupon bond  For this type of bond the  return is the difference between the amount paid and the principal value received at  maturity  Your goal is to estimate an appropriate default risk premium for this bond   You define the default risk premium as the extra return above the risk free return that  will compensate investors for default risk  If R is the promised return  yield to maturity   on the debt instrument and RF is the risk free rate the default risk premium is R   RF   You assess the probability that the bond defaults as P the bond defaults           Looking at current money market yields you find that one year US Treasury bills   T bills  are offering a return of   percent an estimate of RF  As a first step you make  the simplifying assumption that bondholders will recover nothing in the event of a  default  What is the minimum default risk premium you should require for this  instrument 
5,526,The challenge in this type of problem is to find a starting point  In many problems  including this one an effective first step is to divide up the possible outcomes into  mutually exclusive and exhaustive events in an economically logical way  Here from  the viewpoint of a bondholder the two events that affect returns are the bond defaults and the bond does not default  These two events cover all outcomes  How do these  events affect a bondholder s returns  A second step is to compute the value of the bond  for the two events  We have no specifics on bond face value but we can compute value  per    or one unit of currency invested 
6,526,Bond value
7,526,The Bond Defaults The Bond Does Not Default          R 
8,526,The third step is to find the expected value of the bond  per    invested  
9,526,E bond         P the bond defaults          R      P the bond defaults  
10,526,So E bond          R      P the bond defaults    The expected value of the T bill per     invested is      RF   In fact this value is certain because the T bill is risk free  The next  step requires economic reasoning  You want the default premium to be large enough so  that you expect to at least break even compared with investing in the T bill  This  outcome will occur if the expected value of the bond equals the expected value of the  T bill per    invested 
11,526,Expected V alue of Bond   Expected V alue of T  Bill        R       P  the bond def aults          RF  
12,526,Solving for the promised return on the bond you find R         RF       P the bond  defaults         Substituting in the values in the statement of the problem R                                                  or about      percent and default risk premium is R   RF

2,527,You require a default risk premium of at least     basis points  You can state the matter  as follows  If the bond is priced to yield      percent you will earn a     basis point  spread and receive the bond principal with    percent probability  If the bond defaults  however you will lose everything  With a premium of     basis points you expect to  just break even relative to an investment in T bills  Because an investment in the zero  coupon bond has variability if you are risk averse you will demand that the premium be  larger than     basis points 
3,527,This analysis is a starting point  Bondholders usually recover part of their investment  after a default  A next step would be to incorporate a recovery rate 
4,527,In this section we have treated random variables such as EPS as stand alone quantities  We  have not explored how descriptors such as expected value and variance of EPS may be  functions of other random variables  Portfolio return is one random variable that is clearly a  function of other random variables the random returns on the individual securities in the  portfolio  To analyze a portfolio s expected return and variance of return we must understand  these quantities are a function of characteristics of the individual securities  returns  Looking at  the dispersion or variance of portfolio return we see that the way individual security returns  move together or covary is important  To understand the significance of these movements we  need to explore some new concepts covariance and correlation  The next section which deals  with portfolio expected return and variance of return introduces these concepts 
5,527,   PORTFOLIO EXPECTED RETURN AND  VARIANCE OF RETURN
6,527,Modern portfolio theory makes frequent use of the idea that investment opportunities can be  evaluated using expected return as a measure of reward and variance of return as a measure of  risk  The calculation and interpretation of portfolio expected return and variance of return are  fundamental skills  In this section we will develop an understanding of portfolio expected  return and variance of return    Portfolio return is determined by the returns on the individual  holdings  As a result the calculation of portfolio variance as a function of the individual asset  returns is more complex than the variance calculations illustrated in the previous section 
7,527,We work with an example of a portfolio that is    percent invested in an S P     Index fund     percent invested in a US long term corporate bond fund and    percent invested in a fund  indexed to the MSCI EAFE Index  representing equity markets in Europe Australasia and the  Far East   Table   shows these weights

3,528,Weights          
4,528,We first address the calculation of the expected return on the portfolio  In the previous section  we defined the expected value of a random variable as the probability weighted average of the  possible outcomes  Portfolio return we know is a weighted average of the returns on the  securities in the portfolio  Similarly the expected return on a portfolio is a weighted average of  the expected returns on the securities in the portfolio using exactly the same weights  When we  have estimated the expected returns on the individual securities we immediately have portfolio  expected return  This convenient fact follows from the properties of expected value 
5,528,  Properties of Expected Value  Let wi be any constant and Ri be a random variable 
6,528,   The expected value of a constant times a random variable equals the constant times  the expected value of the random variable 
7,528,E wiRi    wiE Ri 
8,528,   The expected value of a weighted sum of random variables equals the weighted  sum of the expected values using the same weights

12,528,Suppose we have a random variable with a given expected value  If we multiply each outcome  by   for example the random variable s expected value is multiplied by   as well  That is the  meaning of Part    The second statement is the rule that directly leads to the expression for  portfolio expected return  A portfolio with n securities is defined by its portfolio weights w   w    wn which sum to    So portfolio return Rp is Rp   w R    w R        wnRn  We can  state the following principle 
13,528,  Calculation of Portfolio Expected Return  Given a portfolio with n securities the  expected return on the portfolio is a weighted average of the expected returns on the  component securities

7,529,In the previous section we studied variance as a measure of dispersion of outcomes around the  expected value  Here we are interested in portfolio variance of return as a measure of  investment risk  Letting Rp stand for the return on the portfolio portfolio variance is    Rp    E   Rp   E Rp     according to Equation    How do we implement this definition  In the reading  on statistical concepts and market returns we learned how to calculate a historical or sample  variance based on a sample of returns  Now we are considering variance in a forward looking  sense  We will use information about the individual assets in the portfolio to obtain portfolio  variance of return  To avoid clutter in notation we write ERp for E Rp   We need the concept of  covariance 
8,529,  Definition of Covariance  Given two random variables Ri and Rj the covariance between  Ri and Rj is

12,529,Equation    states that the covariance between two random variables is the probability  weighted average of the cross products of each random variable s deviation from its own  expected value  We will return to discuss covariance after we establish the need for the concept   Working from the definition of variance we find

10,530,The last step follows from the definitions of variance and covariance    For the italicized  covariance terms in Equation    we used the fact that the order of variables in covariance does  not matter  Cov R R     Cov R R   for example  As we will show the diagonal variance terms     R      R   and    R   can be expressed as Cov R R   Cov R R   and Cov R R    respectively  Using this fact the most compact way to state Equation    is

27,530,We see from Equation    that individual variances of return constitute part but not all of  portfolio variance  The three variances are actually outnumbered by the six covariance terms off  the diagonal  For three assets the ratio is   to   or    percent  If there are    assets there are     variance terms and                   off diagonal covariance terms  The ratio of variance  terms to off diagonal covariance terms is less than   to     or   percent  A first observation  then is that as the number of holdings increases covariance   becomes increasingly important  all else equal

2,531,What exactly is the effect of covariance on portfolio variance  The covariance terms capture  how the co movements of returns affect portfolio variance  For example consider two stocks   One tends to have high returns  relative to its expected return  when the other has low returns   relative to its expected return   The returns on one stock tend to offset the returns on the other  stock lowering the variability or variance of returns on the portfolio  Like variance the units of  covariance are hard to interpret and we will introduce a more intuitive concept shortly   Meanwhile from the definition of covariance we can establish two essential observations about  covariance 
3,531,   We can interpret the sign of covariance as follows 
4,531,Covariance of returns is negative if when the return on one asset is above its expected  value the return on the other asset tends to be below its expected value  an average  inverse relationship between returns  
5,531,Covariance of returns is   if returns on the assets are unrelated 
6,531,Covariance of returns is positive when the returns on both assets tend to be on the same  side  above or below  their expected values at the same time  an average positive  relationship between returns  
7,531,   The covariance of a random variable with itself  own covariance  is its own variance   Cov RR    E  R   E R   R   E R      E  R   E R          R  
8,531,A complete list of the covariances constitutes all the statistical data needed to compute portfolio  variance of return  Covariances are often presented in a square format called a covariance  matrix  Table   summarizes the inputs for portfolio expected return and variance of return

2,532,With three assets the covariance matrix has                entries but it is customary to treat  the diagonal terms the variances separately from the off diagonal terms  These diagonal terms  are bolded in Table    This distinction is natural as security variance is a single variable  concept  So there are           covariances excluding variances  But Cov RBRA    Cov  RARB  Cov RCRA    Cov RARC  and Cov RCRB    Cov RBRC   The covariance matrix  below the diagonal is the mirror image of the covariance matrix above the diagonal  As a result  there are only         distinct covariance terms to estimate  In general for n securities there are  n n        distinct covariances to estimate and n variances to estimate 
3,532,Suppose we have the covariance matrix shown in Table    We will be working in returns stated  as percents and the table entries are in units of percent squared       The terms      and        are        and        respectively stated as decimals  correctly working in percents and  decimals leads to identical answers

12,532,The variance is          Standard deviation of return is                 percent  To summarize  the portfolio has an expected annual return of       percent and a standard deviation of return  of    percent

2,533,Let us look at the first three terms in the calculation above  Their sum                                   is the contribution of the individual variances to portfolio variance  If the returns on  the three assets were independent covariances would be   and the standard deviation of  portfolio return would be                    percent as compared to    percent before  The  portfolio would have less risk  Suppose the covariance terms were negative  Then a negative  number would be added to         so portfolio variance and risk would be even smaller  At  the same time we have not changed expected return  For the same expected portfolio return the  portfolio has less risk  This risk reduction is a diversification benefit meaning a risk reduction  benefit from holding a portfolio of assets  The diversification benefit increases with decreasing  covariance  This observation is a key insight of modern portfolio theory  It is even more  intuitively stated when we can use the concept of correlation  Then we can say that as long as  security returns are not perfectly positively correlated diversification benefits are possible   Furthermore the smaller the correlation between security returns the greater the cost of not  diversifying  in terms of risk reduction benefits forgone  all else equal 
3,533,  Definition of Correlation  The correlation between two random variables Ri and Rj is  defined as   RiRj    Cov RiRj    Ri   Rj   Alternative notations are Corr RiRj  and  ij 
4,533,Frequently covariance is substituted out using the relationship Cov RiRj      RiRj   Ri   Rj    The division indicated in the definition makes correlation a pure number  one without a unit of  measurement  and places bounds on its largest and smallest possible values  Using the above  definition we can state a correlation matrix from data in the covariance matrix alone  Table   shows the correlation matrix

9,533,For example the covariance between long term bonds and MSCI EAFE is    from Table     The standard deviation of long term bond returns is           percent that of MSCI EAFE  returns is             percent from diagonal terms in Table    The correlation   Return on  long term bonds Return on EAFE  is                      rounded to       The correlation  of the S P     with itself equals    The calculation is its own covariance divided by its  standard deviation squared

2,534,   A correlation of    uncorrelated variables  indicates an absence of any linear   straight line  relationship between the variables    Increasingly positive  correlation indicates an increasingly strong positive linear relationship  up to    which indicates a perfect linear relationship   Increasingly negative correlation  indicates an increasingly strong negative  inverse  linear relationship  down to     which indicates a perfect inverse linear relationship

8,535,How do we estimate return covariance and correlation  Frequently we make forecasts on the  basis of historical covariance or use other methods based on historical return data such as a  market model regression    We can also calculate covariance using the joint probability  function of the random variables if that can be estimated  The joint probability function of two  random variables X and Y denoted P XY  gives the probability of joint occurrences of values  of X and Y  For example P      is the probability that X equals   and Y equals   
9,535,Suppose that the joint probability function of the returns on BankCorp stock  RA  and the  returns on NewBank stock  RB  has the simple structure given in Table

10,536,The first and second columns of numbers show respectively the deviations of BankCorp and  NewBank returns from their mean or expected value  The next column shows the product of the  deviations  For example for good industry conditions                                  Then     is multiplied or weighted by      the probability that banking industry conditions are good                  The calculations for average and poor banking conditions follow the same pattern   Summing up these probability weighted products we find that Cov RARB       
11,536,A formula for computing the covariance between random variables RA and RB is

18,536,The formula tells us to sum all possible deviation cross products weighted by the appropriate  joint probability  In the example we just worked as Table    shows only three joint  probabilities are nonzero  Therefore in computing the covariance of returns in this case we  need to consider only three cross products 
19,536,Cov  RA RB     P                                P                                 P                                                                                                 
20,536,One theme of this reading has been independence  Two random variables are independent when  every possible pair of events one event corresponding to a value of X and another event  corresponding to a value of Y are independent events  When two random variables are  independent their joint probability function simplifies

2,537,For example given independence P       P   P     We multiply the individual probabilities  to get the joint probabilities  Independence is a stronger property than uncorrelatedness because  correlation addresses only linear relationships  The following condition holds for independent  random variables and therefore also holds for uncorrelated random variables 
3,537,  Multiplication Rule for Expected Value of the Product of Uncorrelated Random  Variables  The expected value of the product of uncorrelated random variables is the  product of their expected values 
4,537,E XY    E X E Y  if X and Y are uncorrelated 
5,537,Many financial variables such as revenue  price times quantity  are the product of random  quantities  When applicable the above rule simplifies calculating expected value of a product of  random variables   
6,537,   TOPICS IN PROBABILITY
7,537,In the remainder of the reading we discuss two topics that can be important in solving  investment problems  We start with Bayes  formula  what probability theory has to say about  learning from experience  Then we move to a discussion of shortcuts and principles for  counting 
8,537,     Bayes  Formula
9,537,When we make decisions involving investments we often start with viewpoints based on our  experience and knowledge  These viewpoints may be changed or confirmed by new knowledge  and observations  Bayes  formula is a rational method for adjusting our viewpoints as we  confront new information    Bayes  formula and related concepts have been applied in many  business and investment decision making contexts including the evaluation of mutual fund  performance   
10,537,Bayes  formula makes use of Equation   the total probability rule  To review that rule  expressed the probability of an event as a weighted average of the probabilities of the event  given a set of scenarios  Bayes  formula works in reverse  more precisely it reverses the  given  that  information  Bayes  formula uses the occurrence of the event to infer the probability of the  scenario generating it  For that reason Bayes  formula is sometimes called an inverse  probability  In many applications including the one illustrating its use in this section an  individual is updating his beliefs concerning the causes that may have produced a new  observation 
11,537,  Bayes  Formula  Given a set of prior probabilities for an event of interest if you receive  new information the rule for updating your probability of the event is
12,537,Updated probability of event given the new information
13,537, 
14,537,Probability of the new information given event Unconditional probability of the new information

2,538,In probability notation this formula can be written concisely as 
3,538,P  Event   Information   
4,538,P  Information   Event  P  Information 
5,538,P  Event 
6,538,To illustrate Bayes  formula we work through an investment example that can be adapted to  any actual problem  Suppose you are an investor in the stock of DriveMed Inc  Positive  earnings surprises relative to consensus EPS estimates often result in positive stock returns and  negative surprises often have the opposite effect  DriveMed is preparing to release last quarter s  EPS result and you are interested in which of these three events happened  last quarter s EPS  exceeded the consensus EPS estimate or last quarter s EPS exactly met the consensus EPS  estimate or last quarter s EPS fell short of the consensus EPS estimate  This list of the  alternatives is mutually exclusive and exhaustive 
7,538,On the basis of your own research you write down the following prior probabilities  or  priors for short  concerning these three events 
8,538,  P EPS exceeded consensus        
9,538,  P EPS met consensus        
10,538,  P EPS fell short of consensus        
11,538,These probabilities are  prior  in the sense that they reflect only what you know now before  the arrival of any new information 
12,538,The next day DriveMed announces that it is expanding factory capacity in Singapore and  Ireland to meet increased sales demand  You assess this new information  The decision to  expand capacity relates not only to current demand but probably also to the prior quarter s sales  demand  You know that sales demand is positively related to EPS  So now it appears more  likely that last quarter s EPS will exceed the consensus 
13,538,The question you have is  In light of the new information what is the updated probability that  the prior quarter s EPS exceeded the consensus estimate  
14,538,Bayes  formula provides a rational method for accomplishing this updating  We can abbreviate  the new information as DriveMed expands  The first step in applying Bayes  formula is to  calculate the probability of the new information  here  DriveMed expands  given a list of  events or scenarios that may have generated it  The list of events should cover all possibilities  as it does here  Formulating these conditional probabilities is the key step in the updating  process  Suppose your view is
15,538,P DriveMed expands   EPS exceeded consensus        
16,538,P DriveMed expands   EPS met consensus        
17,538,P DriveMed expands   EPS fell short of consensus        
18,538,Conditional probabilities of an observation  here  DriveMed expands  are sometimes referred to  as likelihoods  Again likelihoods are required for updating the probability 
19,538,Next you combine these conditional probabilities or likelihoods with your prior probabilities to  get the unconditional probability for DriveMed expanding P DriveMed expands  as follows

10,539,Prior to DriveMed s announcement you thought the probability that DriveMed would beat  consensus expectations was    percent  On the basis of your interpretation of the  announcement you update that probability to      percent  This updated probability is called  your posterior probability because it reflects or comes after the new information 
11,539,The Bayes  calculation takes the prior probability which was    percent and multiplies it by a  ratio the first term on the right hand side of the equal sign  The denominator of the ratio is the  probability that DriveMed expands as you view it without considering  conditioning on   anything else  Therefore this probability is unconditional  The numerator is the probability that  DriveMed expands if last quarter s EPS actually exceeded the consensus estimate  This last  probability is larger than unconditional probability in the denominator so the ratio        roughly  is greater than    As a result your updated or posterior probability is larger than your  prior probability  Thus the ratio reflects the impact of the new information on your prior  beliefs 
12,539,EXAMPLE   
13,539,Inferring whether DriveMed s EPS Met  Consensus EPS
14,539,You are still an investor in DriveMed stock  To review the givens your prior  probabilities are P EPS exceeded consensus         P EPS met consensus         and  P EPS fell short of consensus          You also have the following conditional  probabilities 
15,539,P DriveMed expands   EPS exceeded consensus         P DriveMed expands   EPS met consensus         P DriveMed expands   EPS fell short of consensus        
16,539,Recall that you updated your probability that last quarter s EPS exceeded the consensus  estimate from    percent to      percent after DriveMed announced it would expand   Now you want to update your other priors

10,540,The probability P DriveMed expands  is found by taking each of the three conditional  probabilities in the statement of the problem such as P DriveMed expands   EPS  exceeded consensus   multiplying each one by the prior probability of the conditioning  event such as P EPS exceeded consensus   then adding the three products  The  calculation is unchanged from the problem in the text above  P DriveMed expands                                                 or    percent  The other probabilities  needed P DriveMed expands   EPS met consensus         and P EPS met consensus          are givens  So
11,540,P EPS met consensus   DriveMed expands 
12,540,   P DriveMed expands   EPS met consensus  P DriveMed expands  P EPS met  consensus 
13,540,                                               
14,540,After taking account of the announcement on expansion your updated probability that  last quarter s EPS for DriveMed just met consensus is      percent compared with your  prior probability of    percent 
15,540,Solution to   
16,540,P DriveMed expands  was already calculated as    percent  Recall that P DriveMed  expands   EPS fell short of consensus         and P EPS fell short of consensus          are givens 
17,540,P  EP S f ell short of consensus DriveM ed expands     P  DriveM ed expands EP S f ell short of consensus    P  DriveM ed expands  P  EP S f ell short of consensus 
18,540,                                                 
19,540,As a result of the announcement you have revised your probability that DriveMed s  EPS fell short of consensus from    percent  your prior probability  to   percent

2,541,Solution to   
3,541,The sum of the three updated probabilities is
4,541,P  EP S exceeded consensus DriveM ed expands    P  EP S met consensus  DriveM ed expands    P  EP S f ell short of consensus DriveM ed expands 
5,541,                                   
6,541,The three events  EPS exceeded consensus EPS met consensus EPS fell short of  consensus  are mutually exclusive and exhaustive  One of these events or statements  must be true so the conditional probabilities must sum to    Whether we are talking  about conditional or unconditional probabilities whenever we have a complete set of the  distinct possible events or outcomes the probabilities must sum to    This calculation  serves as a check on your work 
7,541,Solution to   
8,541,Using the probabilities given in the question
9,541,P  DriveM ed expands    P  DriveM ed expands EP S exceeded consensus  P  EP S exceeded consensus    P  DriveM ed expands  EP S met consensus P  EP S met consensus    P  DriveM ed expands  EP S f ell short of consensus P  EP S f ell short of consensus 
10,541,                                            
11,541,Not surprisingly the probability of DriveMed expanding is     because the decision  maker has no prior beliefs or views regarding how well EPS performed relative to the  consensus estimate  Now we can use Bayes  formula to find P EPS exceeded consensus   DriveMed expands     P DriveMed expands   EPS exceeded consensus  P DriveMed  expands   P EPS exceeded consensus                              or    percent  This  probability is identical to your estimate of P DriveMed expands   EPS exceeded  consensus  
12,541,When the prior probabilities are equal the probability of information given an event  equals the probability of the event given the information  When a decision maker has  equal prior probabilities  called diffuse priors  the probability of an event is  determined by the information

2,542,     Principles of Counting
3,542,The first step in addressing a question often involves determining the different logical  possibilities  We may also want to know the number of ways that each of these possibilities can  happen  In the back of our mind is often a question about probability  How likely is it that I will  observe this particular possibility  Records of success and failure are an example  When we  evaluate a market timer s record one well known evaluation method uses counting methods  presented in this section    An important investment model the binomial option pricing model  incorporates the combination formula that we will cover shortly  We can also use the methods  in this section to calculate what we called a priori probabilities in Section    When we can  assume that the possible outcomes of a random variable are equally likely the probability of an  event equals the number of possible outcomes favorable for the event divided by the total  number of outcomes 
4,542,In counting enumeration  counting the outcomes one by one  is of course the most basic  resource  What we discuss in this section are shortcuts and principles  Without these shortcuts  and principles counting the total number of outcomes can be very difficult and prone to error   The first and basic principle of counting is the multiplication rule 
5,542,  Multiplication Rule of Counting  If one task can be done in n  ways and a second task  given the first can be done in n  ways and a third task given the first two tasks can be  done in n  ways and so on for k tasks then the number of ways the k tasks can be done is   n   n   n      nk  
6,542,Suppose we have three steps in an investment decision process  The first step can be done in  two ways the second in four ways and the third in three ways  Following the multiplication  rule there are                ways in which we can carry out the three steps 
7,542,Another illustration is the assignment of members of a group to an equal number of positions   For example suppose you want to assign three security analysts to cover three different  industries  In how many ways can the assignments be made  The first analyst may be assigned  in three different ways  Then two industries remain  The second analyst can be assigned in two  different ways  Then one industry remains  The third and last analyst can be assigned in only  one way  The total number of different assignments equals                The compact notation  for the multiplication we have just performed is     read    factorial   If we had n analysts the  number of ways we could assign them to n tasks would be
8,542,n    n n      n      n       
9,542,or n factorial   By convention          To review in this application we repeatedly carry out  an operation  here job assignment  until we use up all members of a group  here three  analysts   With n members in the group the multiplication formula reduces to n factorial   
10,542,The next type of counting problem can be called labeling problems    We want to give each  object in a group a label to place it in a category  The following example illustrates this type of  problem

2,543,A mutual fund guide ranked    bond mutual funds by total returns for the year       The guide  also assigned each fund one of five risk labels  high risk  four funds  above average risk  four  funds  average risk  three funds  below average risk  four funds  and low risk  three funds    as                        all the funds are accounted for  How many different ways can we take     mutual funds and label   of them high risk   above average risk   average risk   below  average risk and   low risk so that each fund is labeled 
3,543,The answer is close to    billion  We can label any of    funds high risk  the first slot  then  any of    remaining funds then any of    remaining funds then any of    remaining funds   now we have   funds in the high risk group   then we can label any of    remaining funds  above average risk then any of    remaining funds and so forth  There are     possible  sequences  However order of assignment within a category does not matter  For example  whether a fund occupies the first or third slot of the four funds labeled high risk the fund has  the same label  high risk   Thus there are    ways to assign a given group of four funds to the  four high risk slots  Making the same argument for the other categories in total there are                       equivalent sequences  To eliminate such redundancies from the     total we  divide     by                       We have                                                                   This procedure generalizes as follows 
4,543,  Multinomial Formula  General Formula for Labeling Problems   The number of  ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels with n  of the first type n  of  the second type and so on with n    n        nk   n is given by
5,543,n 
6,543,n    n    nk  
7,543,The multinomial formula with two different labels  k      is especially important  This special  case is called the combination formula  A combination is a listing in which the order of the  listed items does not matter  We state the combination formula in a traditional way but no new  concepts are involved  Using the notation in the formula below the number of objects with the  first label is r   n  and the number with the second label is n   r   n   there are just two  categories so n    n    n   Here is the formula 
8,543,  Combination Formula  Binomial Formula   The number of ways that we can choose r objects from a total of n objects when the order in which the r objects are listed does not  matter is
9,543,nCr     n
10,543,r    
11,543,n   n   r   r 
12,543,Here nCr and   n r   are shorthand notations for n   n   r  r   read  n choose r or n combination  r  
13,543,If we label the r objects as belongs to the group and the remaining objects as does not belong to  the group whatever the group of interest the combination formula tells us how many ways we  can select a group of size r  We can illustrate this formula with the binomial option pricing  model  This model describes the movement of the underlying asset as a series of moves price  up  U  or price down  D   For example two sequences of five moves containing three up  moves such as UUUDD and UDUUD result in the same final stock price  At least for an  option with a payoff dependent on final stock price the number but not the order of up moves  in a sequence matters  How many sequences of five moves belong to the group with three up  moves  The answer is    calculated using the combination formula     choose

3,544,                                                ways
4,544,A useful fact can be illustrated as follows   C            equals  C            as             C             equals  C            as            This symmetrical relationship can save work when we  need to calculate many possible combinations 
5,544,Suppose jurors want to select three companies out of a group of five to receive the first   second  and third place awards for the best annual report  In how many ways can the jurors  make the three awards  Order does matter if we want to distinguish among the three awards   the rank within the group of three   clearly the question makes order important  On the other  hand if the question were  In how many ways can the jurors choose three winners without  regard to place of finish   we would use the combination formula 
6,544,To address the first question above we need to count ordered listings such as first place New  Company  second place Fir Company  third place Well Company  An ordered listing is known  as a permutation and the formula that counts the number of permutations is known as the  permutation formula   
7,544,  Permutation Formula  The number of ways that we can choose r objects from a total of  n objects when the order in which the r objects are listed does matter is
8,544,nPr  
9,544,n   n   r  
10,544,So the jurors have  P                                                      ways in which they can  make their awards  To see why this formula works note that                        reduces to            after cancellation of terms  This calculation counts the number of ways to fill three  slots choosing from a group of five people according to the multiplication rule of counting   This number is naturally larger than it would be if order did not matter  compare    to the value  of    for    choose    that we calculated above   For example first place Well Company   second place Fir Company  third place New Company contains the same three companies as  first place New Company  second place Fir Company  third place Well Company  If we were  concerned only with award winners  without regard to place of finish  the two listings would  count as one combination  But when we are concerned with the order of finish the listings  count as two permutations 
11,544,Answering the following questions may help you apply the counting methods we have  presented in this section 
12,544,   Does the task that I want to measure have a finite number of possible outcomes  If the  answer is yes you may be able to use a tool in this section and you can go to the second  question  If the answer is no the number of outcomes is infinite and the tools in this  section do not apply 
13,544,   Do I want to assign every member of a group of size n to one of n slots  or tasks   If the  answer is yes use n factorial  If the answer is no go to the third question 
14,544,   Do I want to count the number of ways to apply one of three or more labels to each  member of a group  If the answer is yes use the multinomial formula  If the answer is no  go to the fourth question

5,545,SUMMARY
6,545,In this reading we have discussed the essential concepts and tools of probability  We have  applied probability expected value and variance to a range of investment problems 
7,545,  A random variable is a quantity whose outcome is uncertain 
8,545,  Probability is a number between   and   that describes the chance that a stated event will  occur 
9,545,  An event is a specified set of outcomes of a random variable 
10,545,  Mutually exclusive events can occur only one at a time  Exhaustive events cover or  contain all possible outcomes 
11,545,  The two defining properties of a probability are first that     P E       where P E   denotes the probability of an event E  and second that the sum of the probabilities of any  set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events equals   
12,545,  A probability estimated from data as a relative frequency of occurrence is an empirical  probability  A probability drawing on personal or subjective judgment is a subjective  probability  A probability obtained based on logical analysis is an a priori probability 
13,545,  A probability of an event E P E  can be stated as odds for E   P E       P E   or odds  against E        P E   P E  
14,545,  Probabilities that are inconsistent create profit opportunities according to the Dutch Book  Theorem 
15,545,  A probability of an event not conditioned on another event is an unconditional  probability  The unconditional probability of an event A is denoted P A   Unconditional  probabilities are also called marginal probabilities 
16,545,  A probability of an event given  conditioned on  another event is a conditional  probability  The probability of an event A given an event B is denoted P A   B

2,546,  The probability of both A and B occurring is the joint probability of A and B denoted P  AB  
3,546,  P A   B    P AB  P B  P B      
4,546,  The multiplication rule for probabilities is P AB    P A   B P B  
5,546,  The probability that A or B occurs or both occur is denoted by P A or B  
6,546,  The addition rule for probabilities is P A or B    P A    P B    P AB  
7,546,  When events are independent the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability  of occurrence of the other event  Otherwise the events are dependent 
8,546,  The multiplication rule for independent events states that if A and B are independent  events P AB    P A P B   The rule generalizes in similar fashion to more than two  events 
9,546,  According to the total probability rule if S  S    Sn are mutually exclusive and  exhaustive scenarios or events then P A    P A   S  P S     P A   S  P S         P A    Sn P Sn  
10,546,  The expected value of a random variable is a probability weighted average of the possible  outcomes of the random variable  For a random variable X the expected value of X is  denoted E X  
11,546,  The total probability rule for expected value states that E X    E X   S  P S     E X   S  P  S         E X   Sn P Sn  where S  S    Sn are mutually exclusive and exhaustive  scenarios or events 
12,546,  The variance of a random variable is the expected value  the probability weighted  average  of squared deviations from the random variable s expected value E X      X     E  X   E X     where    X  stands for the variance of X 
13,546,  Variance is a measure of dispersion about the mean  Increasing variance indicates  increasing dispersion  Variance is measured in squared units of the original variable 
14,546,  Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance  Standard deviation measures  dispersion  as does variance  but it is measured in the same units as the variable 
15,546,  Covariance is a measure of the co movement between random variables 
16,546,  The covariance between two random variables Ri and Rj is the expected value of the  cross product of the deviations of the two random variables from their respective means   Cov RiRj    E  Ri   E Ri   Rj   E Rj     The covariance of a random variable with itself  is its own variance 
17,546,  Correlation is a number between    and    that measures the co movement  linear  association  between two random variables    RiRj    Cov RiRj     Ri    Rj   
18,546,  To calculate the variance of return on a portfolio of n assets the inputs needed are the n expected returns on the individual assets n variances of return on the individual assets  and n n        distinct covariances

8,547,  The calculation of covariance in a forward looking sense requires the specification of a  joint probability function which gives the probability of joint occurrences of values of  the two random variables 
9,547,  When two random variables are independent the joint probability function is the product  of the individual probability functions of the random variables 
10,547,  Bayes  formula is a method for updating probabilities based on new information 
11,547,  Bayes  formula is expressed as follows  Updated probability of event given the new  information     Probability of the new information given event   Unconditional  probability of the new information     Prior probability of event 
12,547,  The multiplication rule of counting says for example that if the first step in a process can  be done in    ways the second step given the first can be done in   ways and the third  step given the first two can be done in   ways then the steps can be carried out in                   ways 
13,547,  The number of ways to assign every member of a group of size n to n slots is n    n  n        n      n            By convention         
14,547,  The number of ways that n objects can be labeled with k different labels with n  of the  first type n  of the second type and so on with n    n        nk   n is given by n   n   n     nk    This expression is the multinomial formula 
15,547,  A special case of the multinomial formula is the combination formula  The number of  ways to choose r objects from a total of n objects when the order in which the r objects  are listed does not matter is

2,555,We know that P survivor        P nonsurvivor                     Therefore P  pass test                        P pass test   nonsurvivor         Thus P pass test    nonsurvivor

4,555,                             
5,555,The information that a company passes the test causes you to update your  probability that it is a survivor from      to approximately       
6,555,C  According to Bayes  formula P nonsurvivor   fail test     P fail test   nonsurvivor    P fail test  P nonsurvivor     P fail test   nonsurvivor

8,555,P  f ail test    P  f ail test nonsurvivor  P  nonsurvivor   P  f ail test survivor  P  survivor 
9,555,       P  f ail test nonsurvivor                    
10,555,where P fail test   survivor        P pass test   survivor                     So P  fail test   nonsurvivor                                     Using this result with the  formula above we find P nonsurvivor   fail test                            Seeing  that a company fails the test causes us to update the probability that it is a  nonsurvivor from      to      
11,555,D  A company passing the test greatly increases our confidence that it is a survivor  A  company failing the test doubles the probability that it is a nonsurvivor  Therefore  the test appears to be useful 
12,555,   C is correct  The term  exhaustive  means that the events cover all possible outcomes 
13,555,   C is correct  A subjective probability draws on personal or subjective judgment that may  be without reference to any particular data

15,555,   C is correct  A conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another  event has occurred 
16,555,    B is correct  Because the events are independent the multiplication rule is most  appropriate for forecasting their joint probability  The multiplication rule for independent  events states that the joint probability of both A and B occurring is P AB    P A P B  
17,555,    B is correct  The probability of the occurrence of one is related to the occurrence of the  other  If we are trying to forecast one event information about a dependent event may be  useful 
18,555,    C is correct  The total probability rule for expected value is used to estimate an expected  value based on mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios

2,556,    B is correct  If Scenario   occurs the expected recovery is                                       and if Scenario   occurs the expected recovery is                                       Weighting by the probability of each scenario the expected  recovery is                                     Alternatively first calculating the  probability of each amount occurring the expected recovery is                                                                                             
3,556,    A is correct  The covariance is the product of the standard deviations and correlation  using the formula Cov US bond returns Spanish bond returns      US bonds        Spanish bonds      US bond returns Spanish bond returns                                
4,556,    C is correct  The covariance of returns is positive when the returns on both assets tend to  be on the same side  above or below  their expected values at the same time indicating  an average positive relationship between returns 
5,556,    B is correct  Correlations near    exhibit strong positive linearity whereas correlations  near    exhibit strong negative linearity  A correlation of   indicates an absence of any  linear relationship between the variables  The closer the correlation is to   the weaker the  linear relationship 
6,556,    C is correct  The correlation between two random variables Ri and Rj is defined as   RiRj     Cov RiRj    Ri   Rj   Using the subscript i to represent hedge funds and the subscript j to represent the market index the standard deviations are   Ri                and   Rj                Thus   RiRj    Cov RiRj    Ri    Rj                         
7,556,    A is correct  As the correlation between two assets approaches    diversification benefits  decrease  In other words an increasingly positive correlation indicates an increasingly  strong positive linear relationship and fewer diversification benefits 
8,556,    A is correct  A covariance matrix for five stocks has            entries  Subtracting the    diagonal variance terms results in    off diagonal entries  Because a covariance matrix is  symmetrical only    entries are unique             
9,556,    A is correct  The analyst must first calculate expected sales as                                               million          million         million          million 
10,556,After calculating expected sales we can calculate the variance of sales 
11,556,      Sales 
12,556,  P            E Sales      P            E Sales      P            E Sales

20,557,NOTES
21,557, In the reading on common probability distributions we describe some of the probability distributions most  frequently used in investment applications 
22,557, Selling short or shorting stock means selling borrowed shares in the hope of repurchasing them later at a lower  price 
23,557, The theorem s name comes from the terminology of wagering  Suppose someone places a      bet on X at odds  of    to   against X and later he is able to place a      bet against X at odds of   to   against X  Whatever the  outcome of X that person makes a riskless profit  equal to      if X occurs or      if X does not occur  because  the implied probabilities are inconsistent  He is said to have made a Dutch book in X  Ramsey        presented  the problem of inconsistent probabilities  See also Lo        
24,557, In analyses of probabilities presented in tables unconditional probabilities usually appear at the ends or margins of the table hence the term marginal probability  Because of possible confusion with the way marginal is used in  economics  roughly meaning incremental  we use the term unconditional probability throughout this discussion

2,558, In this example the conditional probability is greater than the unconditional probability  The conditional  probability of an event may however be greater than equal to or less than the unconditional probability  depending on the facts  For instance the probability that the stock earns a return above the risk free rate given that  the stock earns a negative return is   
3,558, Sequential comparisons of quarterly EPS are with the immediate prior quarter  A sequential comparison stands in  contrast to a comparison with the same quarter one year ago  another frequent type of comparison  
4,558, For readers familiar with mathematical treatments of probability S a notation usually reserved for a concept  called the sample space is being appropriated to stand for scenario 
5,558, For simplicity we model all random variables in this reading as discrete random variables which have a  countable set of outcomes  For continuous random variables which are discussed along with discrete random  variables in the reading on common probability distributions the operation corresponding to summation is  integration 
6,558, The unconditional variance of EPS is the sum of two terms     the expected value  probability weighted average   of the conditional variances  parallel to the total probability rules  and    the variance of conditional expected  values of EPS  The second term arises because the variability in conditional expected value is a source of risk   Term   is    EPS    P declining interest rate environment     EPS   declining interest rate environment    P  stable interest rate environment     EPS   stable interest rate environment                                               Term   is    E EPS   interest rate environment                                                                Summing the two terms unconditional variance equals                                
7,558,  Although we outline a number of basic concepts in this section we do not present mean variance analysis per  se  For a presentation of mean variance analysis see the readings on portfolio concepts as well as the extended  treatments in standard investment textbooks such as Bodie Kane and Marcus        Elton Gruber Brown and  Goetzmann        and Reilly and Brown        
8,558,  Useful facts about variance and covariance include     The variance of a constant times a random variable  equals the constant squared times the variance of the random variable or    wR    w    R      The variance of a  constant plus a random variable equals the variance of the random variable or    w   R       R  because a  constant has zero variance     The covariance between a constant and a random variable is zero 
9,558,  When the meaning of covariance as  off diagonal covariance  is obvious as it is here we omit the qualifying  words  Covariance is usually used in this sense 
10,558,  If the correlation is   R    a   bR    error with b     
11,558,  If the correlation is positive R    a   bR    error with b      If the correlation is negative b

5,562,   INTRODUCTION TO COMMON PROBABILITY  DISTRIBUTIONS
6,562,In nearly all investment decisions we work with random variables  The return on a stock and its earnings per  share are familiar examples of random variables  To make probability statements about a random variable we  need to understand its probability distribution  A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the  possible outcomes of a random variable 
7,562,In this reading we present important facts about four probability distributions and their investment uses   These four distributions the uniform binomial normal and lognormal are used extensively in investment  analysis  They are used in such basic valuation models as the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model  the binomial option pricing model and the capital asset pricing model  With the working knowledge of  probability distributions provided in this reading you will also be better prepared to study and use other  quantitative methods such as hypothesis testing regression analysis and time series analysis 
8,562,After discussing probability distributions we end the reading with an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation  a computer based tool for obtaining information on complex problems  For example an investment analyst  may want to experiment with an investment idea without actually implementing it  Or she may need to price a  complex option for which no simple pricing formula exists  In these cases and many others Monte Carlo  simulation is an important resource  To conduct a Monte Carlo simulation the analyst must identify risk  factors associated with the problem and specify probability distributions for them  Hence Monte Carlo  simulation is a tool that requires an understanding of probability distributions 
9,562,Before we discuss specific probability distributions we define basic concepts and terms  We then illustrate  the operation of these concepts through the simplest distribution the uniform distribution  That done we  address probability distributions that have more applications in investment work but also greater complexity 
10,562,   DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES
11,562,A random variable is a quantity whose future outcomes are uncertain  The two basic types of random  variables are discrete random variables and continuous random variables  A discrete random variable can  take on at most a countable number of possible values  For example a discrete random variable X can take on  a limited number of outcomes x  x    xn  n possible outcomes  or a discrete random variable Y can take on  an unlimited number of outcomes y  y     without end    Because we can count all the possible outcomes  of X and Y  even if we go on forever in the case of Y  both X and Y satisfy the definition of a discrete random  variable  By contrast we cannot count the outcomes of a continuous random variable  We cannot describe  the possible outcomes of a continuous random variable Z with a list z  z    because the outcome  z    z      not in the list would always be possible  Rate of return is an example of a continuous random variable

2,563,In working with a random variable we need to understand its possible outcomes  For example a majority of  the stocks traded on the New Zealand Stock Exchange are quoted in ticks of NZ       Quoted stock price is  thus a discrete random variable with possible values NZ   NZ      NZ        But we can also model  stock price as a continuous random variable  as a lognormal random variable to look ahead   In many  applications we have a choice between using a discrete or a continuous distribution  We are usually guided  by which distribution is most efficient for the task we face  This opportunity for choice is not surprising as  many discrete distributions can be approximated with a continuous distribution and vice versa  In most  practical cases a probability distribution is only a mathematical idealization or approximate model of the  relative frequencies of a random variable s possible outcomes 
3,563,EXAMPLE  
4,563,The Distribution of Bond Price
5,563,You are researching a probability model for bond price and you begin by thinking about the  characteristics of bonds that affect price  What are the lowest and the highest possible values for bond  price  Why  What are some other characteristics of bonds that may affect the distribution of bond  price 
6,563,The lowest possible value of bond price is   when the bond is worthless  Identifying the highest  possible value for bond price is more challenging  The promised payments on a coupon bond are the  coupons  interest payments  plus the face amount  principal   The price of a bond is the present  discounted value of these promised payments  Because investors require a return on their investments    percent is the lower limit on the discount rate that investors would use to discount a bond s  promised payments  At a discount rate of   percent the price of a bond is the sum of the face value  and the remaining coupons without any discounting  The discount rate thus places the upper limit on  bond price  Suppose for example that face value is       and two     coupons remain  the interval     to       captures all possible values of the bond s price  This upper limit decreases through time  as the number of remaining payments decreases 
7,563,Other characteristics of a bond also affect its price distribution  Pull to par value is one such  characteristic  As the maturity date approaches the standard deviation of bond price tends to grow  smaller as bond price converges to par value  Embedded options also affect bond price  For example  with bonds that are currently callable the issuer may retire the bonds at a prespecified premium above  par  this option of the issuer cuts off part of the bond s upside  Modeling bond price distribution is a  challenging problem 
8,563,Every random variable is associated with a probability distribution that describes the variable completely  We  can view a probability distribution in two ways  The basic view is the probability function which specifies  the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value  P X   x  is the probability that a random  variable X takes on the value x   Note that capital X represents the random variable and lowercase x represents  a specific value that the random variable may take   For a discrete random variable the shorthand notation for  the probability function is p x    P X   x   For continuous random variables the probability function is  denoted f x  and called the probability density function  pdf  or just the density  
9,563,A probability function has two key properties  which we state without loss of generality using the notation  for a discrete random variable  
10,563,      p x      because probability is a number between   and   
11,563,  The sum of the probabilities p x  over all values of X equals    If we add up the probabilities of all the  distinct possible outcomes of a random variable that sum must equal

2,564,We are often interested in finding the probability of a range of outcomes rather than a specific outcome  In  these cases we take the second view of a probability distribution the cumulative distribution function  cdf    The cumulative distribution function or distribution function for short gives the probability that a  random variable X is less than or equal to a particular value x P X   x   For both discrete and continuous  random variables the shorthand notation is F x    P X   x   How does the cumulative distribution function  relate to the probability function  The word  cumulative  tells the story  To find F x  we sum up or  cumulate values of the probability function for all outcomes less than or equal to x  The function of the cdf is  parallel to that of cumulative relative frequency which we discussed in the reading on statistical concepts and  market returns 
3,564,Next we illustrate these concepts with examples and show how we use discrete and continuous distributions   We start with the simplest distribution the discrete uniform 
4,564,     The Discrete Uniform Distribution
5,564,The simplest of all probability distributions is the discrete uniform distribution  Suppose that the possible  outcomes are the integers  whole numbers    to   inclusive and the probability that the random variable  takes on any of these possible values is the same for all outcomes  that is it is uniform   With eight outcomes  p x        or       for all values of X  X                     the statement just made is a complete  description of this discrete uniform random variable  The distribution has a finite number of specified  outcomes and each outcome is equally likely  Table   summarizes the two views of this random variable the  probability function and the cumulative distribution function 
6,564,Table    Probability Function and Cumulative Distribution Function for a Discrete Uniform  Random Variable
7,564,Probability Function p x    P X   x

10,564,We can use Table   to find three probabilities  P X      P     X      and P     X       The following  examples illustrate how to use the cdf to find the probability that a random variable will fall in any interval   for any random variable not only the uniform  
11,564,  The probability that X is less than or equal to   P X      is the next to last entry in the third column        or      percent 
12,564,  To find P     X      we need to find the sum of three probabilities  p    p    and p     We can find  this sum in two ways  We can add p    p    and p    from the second column  Or we can calculate the  probability as the difference between two values of the cumulative distribution function

3,565,P     X        F      F      p      p      p         
4,565,So we calculate the second probability as F      F          
5,565,  The third probability P     X      the probability that X is less than or equal to   but greater than   is  p      p     We compute it as follows using the cdf 
6,565,P     X        P X        P X        F      F      p      p         
7,565,So we calculate the third probability as F      F          
8,565,Suppose we want to check that the discrete uniform probability function satisfies the general properties of a  probability function given earlier  The first property is     p x       We see that p x        for all x in the first  column of the table   Note that p x  equals   for numbers x such as     or        that are not in that column    The first property is satisfied  The second property is that the probabilities sum to    The entries in the second  column of Table   do sum to   
9,565,The cdf has two other characteristic properties 
10,565,  The cdf lies between   and   for any x      F x      
11,565,  As we increase x the cdf either increases or remains constant 
12,565,Check these statements by looking at the third column in Table   
13,565,We now have some experience working with probability functions and cdfs for discrete random variables   Later in this reading we will discuss Monte Carlo simulation a methodology driven by random numbers  As  we will see the uniform distribution has an important technical use  It is the basis for generating random  numbers which in turn produce random observations for all other probability distributions  
14,565,     The Binomial Distribution
15,565,In many investment contexts we view a result as either a success or a failure or as binary  twofold  in some  other way  When we make probability statements about a record of successes and failures or about anything  with binary outcomes we often use the binomial distribution  What is a good model for how a stock price  moves through time  Different models are appropriate for different uses  Cox Ross and Rubinstein        developed an option pricing model based on binary moves price up or price down for the asset underlying  the option  Their binomial option pricing model was the first of a class of related option pricing models that  have played an important role in the development of the derivatives industry  That fact alone would be  sufficient reason for studying the binomial distribution but the binomial distribution has uses in decision  making as well 
16,565,The building block of the binomial distribution is the Bernoulli random variable named after the Swiss  probabilist Jakob Bernoulli              Suppose we have a trial  an event that may repeat  that produces  one of two outcomes  Such a trial is a Bernoulli trial  If we let Y equal   when the outcome is success and Y equal   when the outcome is failure then the probability function of the Bernoulli random variable Y is
17,565,p      P Y        p
18,565,p      P Y            p
19,565,where p is the probability that the trial is a success  Our next example is the very first step on the road to  understanding the binomial option pricing model

2,566,One Period Stock Price Movement as a Bernoulli  Random Variable
3,566,Suppose we describe stock price movement in the following way  Stock price today is S  Next period  stock price can move up or down  The probability of an up move is p and the probability of a down  move is     p  Thus stock price is a Bernoulli random variable with probability of success  an up  move  equal to p  When the stock moves up ending price is uS with u equal to   plus the rate of  return if the stock moves up  For example if the stock earns      or   percent on an up move u          When the stock moves down ending price is dS with d equal to   plus the rate of return if the  stock moves down  For example if the stock earns       or    percent on a down move d          Figure   shows a diagram of this model of stock price dynamics 
4,566,Figure    One Period Stock Price as a Bernoulli Random Variable
5,566,We will continue with the above example later  In the model of stock price movement in Example   success  and failure at a given trial relate to up moves and down moves respectively  In the following example  success is a profitable trade and failure is an unprofitable one

8,566,You work in equities trading at an institutional money manager that regularly trades with a number of  block brokers  Blocks are orders to sell or buy that are too large for the liquidity ordinarily available in  dealer networks or stock exchanges  Your firm has known interests in certain kinds of stock  Block  brokers call your trading desk when they want to sell blocks of stocks that they think your firm may  be interested in buying  You know that these transactions have definite risks  For example if the  broker s client  the seller of the shares  has unfavorable information on the stock or if the total  amount he is selling through all channels is not truthfully communicated to you you may see an  immediate loss on the trade  From time to time your firm audits the performance of block brokers   Your firm calculates the post trade market risk adjusted dollar returns on stocks purchased from  block brokers  On that basis you classify each trade as unprofitable or profitable  You have  summarized the performance of the brokers in a spreadsheet excerpted in Table   for November         The broker names are coded BB    and BB

5,567,View each trade as a Bernoulli trial  Calculate the percentage of profitable trades with the two block  brokers for November       These are estimates of p the underlying probability of a successful   profitable  trade with each broker 
6,567,Your firm has logged            trades  the row total  with block broker BB     Because   of the     trades were profitable the percentage of profitable trades was      or    percent  With broker BB     the percentage of profitable trades was     or      percent  A trade is a Bernoulli trial and the above  calculations provide estimates of the underlying probability of a profitable trade  success  with the      p         for broker BB    your estimate is  p

8,567,In n Bernoulli trials we can have   to n successes  If the outcome of an individual trial is random the total  number of successes in n trials is also random  A binomial random variable X is defined as the number of  successes in n Bernoulli trials  A binomial random variable is the sum of Bernoulli random variables Yi i          n 
9,567,X   Y    Y        Yn
10,567,where Yi is the outcome on the ith trial    if a success   if a failure   We know that a Bernoulli random  variable is defined by the parameter p  The number of trials n is the second parameter of a binomial random  variable  The binomial distribution makes these assumptions 
11,567,  The probability p of success is constant for all trials 
12,567,  The trials are independent 
13,567,The second assumption has great simplifying force  If individual trials were correlated calculating the  probability of a given number of successes in n trials would be much more complicated 
14,567,Under the above two assumptions a binomial random variable is completely described by two parameters n and p  We write
15,567,X   B np 
16,567,which we read as  X has a binomial distribution with parameters n and p   You can see that a Bernoulli  random variable is a binomial random variable with n      Y   B   p  
17,567,Now we can find the general expression for the probability that a binomial random variable shows x successes in n trials  We can think in terms of a model of stock price dynamics that can be generalized to  allow any possible stock price movements if the periods are made extremely small  Each period is a Bernoulli  trial  With probability p the stock price moves up  with probability     p the price moves down  A success is  an up move and x is the number of up moves or successes in n periods  trials   With each period s moves  independent and p constant the number of up moves in n periods is a binomial random variable  We now  develop an expression for P X   x  the probability function for a binomial random variable

2,568,Any sequence of n periods that shows exactly x up moves must show n   x down moves  We have many  different ways to order the up moves and down moves to get a total of x up moves but given independent  trials any sequence with x up moves must occur with probability px     p n x  Now we need to multiply this  probability by the number of different ways we can get a sequence with x up moves  Using a basic result in  counting from the reading on probability concepts there are

4,568,different sequences in n trials that result in x up moves  or successes  and n   x down moves  or failures    Recall from the reading on probability concepts that n factorial  n   is defined as n n      n           and         by convention   For example                             The combination formula n    n   x  x   is  denoted by

16,569,With an understanding of the binomial probability function in hand we can continue with our example of  block brokers 
17,569,EXAMPLE  
18,569,A Trading Desk Evaluates Block Brokers    
19,569,You now want to evaluate the performance of the block brokers in Example    You begin with two  questions 
20,569,   If you are paying a fair price on average in your trades with a broker what should be the  probability of a profitable trade 
21,569,   Did each broker meet or miss that expectation on probability 
22,569,You also realize that the brokers  performance has to be evaluated in light of the sample s size and  for that you need to use the binomial probability function  Equation     You thus address the  following  referring to the data in Example    
23,569,   Under the assumption that the prices of trades were fair
24,569,A  calculate the probability of three or fewer profitable trades with broker BB    
25,569,B  calculate the probability of five or more profitable trades with broker BB    
26,569,Solution to   and   
27,569,If the price you trade at is fair    percent of the trades you do with a broker should be profitable   The rate of profitable trades with broker BB    was    percent  Therefore broker BB    missed  your performance expectation  Broker BB    at      percent profitable trades exceeded your  expectation

3,570,Suppose the underlying probability of a profitable trade with BB    is p         With n       and p        according to Equation   the probability of three profitable trades is

11,570,B  For broker BB    you are assessing the probability that the underlying probability of a  profitable trade with this broker was    percent despite the good results  The question was  framed as the probability of doing five or more profitable trades if the underlying probability is     percent      F      p      p      p      p     You could calculate F    and subtract it from    but you can also calculate p      p      p      p    directly 
12,570,You begin by calculating the probability that exactly   out of   trades would be profitable if  BB    were giving you fair prices

19,570,The magnitude of the profits and losses in these trades is another important consideration  If all  profitable trades had small profits but all unprofitable trades had large losses for example you  might lose money on your trades even if the majority of them were profitable

4,571,You work for a pension fund sponsor  You have assigned a new money manager to manage a       million portfolio indexed on the MSCI EAFE  Europe Australasia and Far East  Index which is  designed to measure developed market equity performance excluding the United States and Canada   After research you believe it is reasonable to expect that the manager will keep portfolio return within  a band of    basis points  bps  of the benchmark s return on a quarterly basis   To quantify this  expectation further you will be satisfied if portfolio return is within the    bps band    percent of the  time  The manager meets the objective in six out of eight quarters  Of course six out of eight quarters  is a    percent success rate  But how does the manager s record precisely relate to your expectation of  a    percent success rate and the sample size   observations  To answer this question you must find  the probability that given an assumed true or underlying success rate of    percent performance  could be as bad as or worse than that delivered  Calculate the probability  by hand or with a  spreadsheet

15,571,You can use other evaluation concepts such as tracking error or tracking risk defined as the standard  deviation of return differences between a portfolio and its benchmark to assess the manager s  performance  The calculation above would be only one input into any conclusions that you reach  concerning the manager s performance  But to answer problems involving success rates you need to  be skilled in using the binomial distribution 
16,571,Two descriptors of a distribution that are often used in investments are the mean and the variance  or the  standard deviation the positive square root of variance    Table   gives the expressions for the mean and  variance of binomial random variables

7,572,The Expected Number of Defaults in a Bond  Portfolio
8,572,Suppose as a bond analyst you are asked to estimate the number of bond issues expected to default  over the next year in an unmanaged high yield bond portfolio with    US issues from distinct issuers   The credit ratings of the bonds in the portfolio are tightly clustered around Moody s B  Standard    Poor s B meaning that the bonds are speculative with respect to the capacity to pay interest and repay  principal  The estimated annual default rate for B  B rated bonds is      percent 
9,572,   Over the next year what is the expected number of defaults in the portfolio assuming a  binomial model for defaults 
10,572,   Estimate the standard deviation of the number of defaults over the coming year 
11,572,   Critique the use of the binomial probability model in this context 
12,572,Solution to   
13,572,For each bond we can define a Bernoulli random variable equal to   if the bond defaults during the  year and zero otherwise  With    bonds the expected number of defaults over the year is np                      or approximately   
14,572,Solution to   
15,572,The variance is np     p                                 The standard deviation is                        Thus a two standard deviation confidence interval about the expected number of defaults would  run from approximately   to approximately   for example

2,573,Solution to   
3,573,An assumption of the binomial model is that the trials are independent  In this context a trial relates to  whether an individual bond issue will default over the next year  Because the issuing companies  probably share exposure to common economic factors the trials may not be independent   Nevertheless for a quick estimate of the expected number of defaults the binomial model may be  adequate 
4,573,Earlier we looked at a simple one period model for stock price movement  Now we extend the model to  describe stock price movement on three consecutive days  Each day is an independent trial  The stock moves  up with constant probability p  the up transition probability   if it moves up u is   plus the rate of return  for an up move  The stock moves down with constant probability     p  the down transition probability    if it moves down d is   plus the rate of return for a down move  We graph stock price movement in Figure    where we now associate each of the n     stock price moves with time indexed by t  The shape of the graph  suggests why it is a called a binomial tree  Each boxed value from which successive moves or outcomes  branch in the tree is called a node  in this example a node is potential value for the stock price at a specified  time 
5,573,Figure    A Binomial Model of Stock Price Movement
6,573,We see from the tree that the stock price at t     has four possible values  uuuS uudS uddS and dddS  The  probability that the stock price equals any one of these four values is given by the binomial distribution  For  example three sequences of moves result in a final stock price of uudS  These are uud udu and duu  These  sequences have two up moves out of three moves in total  the combination formula confirms that the number  of ways to get two up moves  successes  in three periods  trials  is                    Next note that each of  these sequences uud udu and duu has probability p      p   So P S    uudS     p      p  where S  indicates the stock s price after three moves

2,574,The binomial random variable in this application is the number of up moves  Final stock price distribution is a  function of the initial stock price the number of up moves and the size of the up moves and down moves  We  cannot say that stock price itself is a binomial random variable  rather it is a function of a binomial random  variable as well as of u and d and initial price  This richness is actually one key to why this way of modeling  stock price is useful  It allows us to choose values of these parameters to approximate various distributions  for stock price  using a large number of time periods     One distribution that can be approximated is the  lognormal an important continuous distribution model for stock price that we will discuss later  The  flexibility extends further  In the tree shown above the transition probabilities are the same at each node  p for an up move and     p for a down move  That standard formula describes a process in which stock return  volatility is constant through time  Option experts however sometimes model changing volatility through  time using a binomial tree in which the probabilities for up and down moves differ at different nodes 
3,574,The binomial tree also supplies the possibility of testing a condition or contingency at any node  This  flexibility is useful in investment applications such as option pricing  Consider an American call option on a  dividend paying stock   Recall that an American option can be exercised at any time before expiration at any  node on the tree   Just before an ex dividend date it may be optimal to exercise an American call option on  stock to buy the stock and receive the dividend    If we model stock price with a binomial tree we can test at  each node whether exercising the option is optimal  Also if we know the value of the call at the four terminal  nodes at t     and we have a model for discounting values by one period we can step backward one period to  t     to find the call s value at the three nodes there  Continuing back recursively we can find the call s value  today  This type of recursive operation is easily programmed on a computer  As a result binomial trees can  value options even more complex than American calls on stock   
4,574,   CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES
5,574,In the previous section we considered discrete random variables  i e  random variables whose set of possible  outcomes is countable   In contrast the possible outcomes of continuous random variables are never  countable  If       is one possible value of a continuous random variable for example we cannot name the  next higher or lower possible value  Technically the range of possible outcomes of a continuous random  variable is the real line  all real numbers between    and     or some subset of the real line 
6,574,In this section we focus on the two most important continuous distributions in investment work the normal  and lognormal  As we did with discrete distributions we introduce the topic through the uniform distribution 
7,574,     Continuous Uniform Distribution
8,574,The continuous uniform distribution is the simplest continuous probability distribution  The uniform  distribution has two main uses  As the basis of techniques for generating random numbers the uniform  distribution plays a role in Monte Carlo simulation  As the probability distribution that describes equally  likely outcomes the uniform distribution is an appropriate probability model to represent a particular kind of  uncertainty in beliefs in which all outcomes appear equally likely

3,575,The graph of the density function plots as a horizontal line with a value of       
4,575,What is the probability that a uniform random variable with limits a     and b     is less than or equal to   or  F      P X       When we were working with the discrete uniform random variable with possible outcomes          we summed individual probabilities  p      p      p             In contrast the probability that a  continuous uniform random variable or any continuous random variable assumes any given fixed value is     To illustrate this point consider the narrow interval       to        Because that interval holds an infinity of  possible values the sum of the probabilities of values in that interval alone would be infinite if each  individual value in it had a positive probability  To find the probability F    we find the area under the curve  graphing the pdf between   to   on the x axis  In calculus this operation is called integrating the probability  function f x  from   to    This area under the curve is a rectangle with base           and height      The area  of this rectangle equals base times height               or        So F          or       
5,575,The interval from   to   is three eighths of the total length between the limits of   and   and F    is three  eighths of the total probability of    The middle line of the expression for the cdf captures this relationship

9,576,Recall that the probability of a continuous random variable equaling any fixed point is    This fact has an  important consequence for working with the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random  variable  For any continuous random variable X P a   X   b    P a   X   b    P a   X   b    P a   X   b   because the probabilities at the endpoints a and b are    For discrete random variables these relations of  equality are not true because probability accumulates at points

2,577,Probability That a Lending Facility Covenant Is  Breached
3,577,You are evaluating the bonds of a below investment grade borrower at a low point in its business  cycle  You have many factors to consider including the terms of the company s bank lending  facilities  The contract creating a bank lending facility such as an unsecured line of credit typically has  clauses known as covenants  These covenants place restrictions on what the borrower can do  The  company will be in breach of a covenant in the lending facility if the interest coverage ratio  EBITDA interest calculated on EBITDA over the four trailing quarters falls below      EBITDA is  earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization    Compliance with the covenants will  be checked at the end of the current quarter  If the covenant is breached the bank can demand  immediate repayment of all borrowings on the facility  That action would probably trigger a liquidity  crisis for the company  With a high degree of confidence you forecast interest charges of     million   Your estimate of EBITDA runs from     million on the low end to     million on the high end 
4,577,Address two questions  treating projected interest charges as a constant  
5,577,   If the outcomes for EBITDA are equally likely what is the probability that EBITDA interest  will fall below     breaching the covenant 
6,577,   Estimate the mean and standard deviation of EBITDA interest  For a continuous uniform  random variable the mean is given by      a   b    and the variance is given by       b   a       
7,577,Solution to   
8,577,EBITDA interest is a continuous uniform random variable because all outcomes are equally likely   The ratio can take on values between            million       million  on the low end and             million     million  on the high end  The range of possible values is                  What fraction of  the possible values falls below     the level that triggers default  The distance between     and     is        the value      is one half the total length of     or                 So the probability that the  covenant will be breached is    percent 
9,577,Solution to   
10,577,In Solution   we found that the lower limit of EBITDA interest is      This lower limit is a  We found  that the upper limit is      This upper limit is b  Using the formula given above

14,577,The standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance                           The  standard deviation is not particularly useful as a risk measure for a uniform distribution however  The  probability that lies within various standard deviation bands around the mean is sensitive to different  specifications of the upper and lower limits  although Chebyshev s inequality is always satisfied     Here a one standard deviation interval around the mean of     runs from       to       and captures                      or      percent of the probability  A two standard deviation interval runs from        to       which extends past both the lower and upper limits of the random variable

2,578,The normal distribution may be the most extensively used probability distribution in quantitative work  It  plays key roles in modern portfolio theory and in a number of risk management technologies  Because it has  so many uses the normal distribution must be thoroughly understood by investment professionals 
3,578,The role of the normal distribution in statistical inference and regression analysis is vastly extended by a  crucial result known as the central limit theorem  The central limit theorem states that the sum  and mean  of  a large number of independent random variables is approximately normally distributed   
4,578,The French mathematician Abraham de Moivre             introduced the normal distribution in      in  developing a version of the central limit theorem  As Figure   shows the normal distribution is symmetrical  and bell shaped  The range of possible outcomes of the normal distribution is the entire real line  all real  numbers lying between    and     The tails of the bell curve extend without limit to the left and to the right 
5,578,Figure    Two Normal Distributions
6,578,The defining characteristics of a normal distribution are as follows 
7,578,  The normal distribution is completely described by two parameters its mean   and variance     We  indicate this as X   N        read  X follows a normal distribution with mean   and variance       We  can also define a normal distribution in terms of the mean and the standard deviation    this is often  convenient because   is measured in the same units as X and     As a consequence we can answer any  probability question about a normal random variable if we know its mean and variance  or standard  deviation  
8,578,  The normal distribution has a skewness of    it is symmetric   The normal distribution has a kurtosis of     its excess kurtosis  kurtosis        equals      As a consequence of symmetry the mean median  and the mode are all equal for a normal random variable 
9,578,  A linear combination of two or more normal random variables is also normally distributed

2,579,These bullet points concern a single variable or univariate normal distribution  the distribution of one normal  random variable  A univariate distribution describes a single random variable  A multivariate  distribution specifies the probabilities for a group of related random variables  You will encounter the  multivariate normal distribution in investment work and reading and should know the following about it 
3,579,When we have a group of assets we can model the distribution of returns on each asset individually or the  distribution of returns on the assets as a group   As a group  means that we take account of all the statistical  interrelationships among the return series  One model that has often been used for security returns is the  multivariate normal distribution  A multivariate normal distribution for the returns on n stocks is completely  defined by three lists of parameters 
4,579,  the list of the mean returns on the individual securities  n means in total  
5,579,  the list of the securities  variances of return  n variances in total   and
6,579,  the list of all the distinct pairwise return correlations  n n        distinct correlations in total   
7,579,The need to specify correlations is a distinguishing feature of the multivariate normal distribution in contrast  to the univariate normal distribution 
8,579,The statement  assume returns are normally distributed  is sometimes used to mean a joint normal  distribution  For a portfolio of    securities for example portfolio return is a weighted average of the returns  on the    securities  A weighted average is a linear combination  Thus portfolio return is normally distributed  if the individual security returns are  joint  normally distributed  To review in order to specify the normal  distribution for portfolio return we need the means variances and the distinct pairwise correlations of the  component securities 
9,579,With these concepts in mind we can return to the normal distribution for one random variable  The curves  graphed in Figure   are the normal density function 
10,579,Equation    
11,579,f  x

16,579,  for       x      
17,579,The two densities graphed in Figure   correspond to a mean of       and standard deviations of       and         The normal density with       and       is called the standard normal distribution  or unit normal  distribution   Plotting two normal distributions with the same mean and different standard deviations helps  us appreciate why standard deviation is a good measure of dispersion for the normal distribution   Observations are much more concentrated around the mean for the normal distribution with       than for the  normal distribution with       
18,579,Although not literally accurate the normal distribution can be considered an approximate model for returns   Nearly all the probability of a normal random variable is contained within three standard deviations of the  mean  For realistic values of mean return and return standard deviation for many assets the normal  probability of outcomes below      percent is very small  Whether the approximation is useful in a given  application is an empirical question  For example the normal distribution is a closer fit for quarterly and  yearly holding period returns on a diversified equity portfolio than it is for daily or weekly returns    A  persistent departure from normality in most equity return series is kurtosis greater than   the fat tails  problem  So when we approximate equity return distributions with the normal distribution we should be  aware that the normal distribution tends to underestimate the probability of extreme returns    Option returns  are skewed  Because the normal is a symmetrical distribution we should be cautious in using the normal  distribution to model the returns on portfolios containing significant positions in options 
19,579,The normal distribution however is less suitable as a model for asset prices than as a model for returns  A  normal random variable has no lower limit  This characteristic has several implications for investment  applications  An asset price can drop only to   at which point the asset becomes worthless  As a result  practitioners generally do not use the normal distribution to model the distribution of asset prices  Also note  that moving from any level of asset price to   translates into a return of      percent  Because the normal  distribution extends below   without limit it cannot be literally accurate as a model for asset returns

2,580,Having established that the normal distribution is the appropriate model for a variable of interest we can use  it to make the following probability statements 
3,580,  Approximately    percent of all observations fall in the interval            
4,580,  Approximately    percent of all observations fall in the interval       
5,580,  Approximately    percent of all observations fall in the interval        
6,580,  Approximately    percent of all observations fall in the interval        
7,580,One two and three standard deviation intervals are illustrated in Figure    The intervals indicated are easy to  remember but are only approximate for the stated probabilities  More precise intervals are           for     percent of the observations and           for    percent of the observations 
8,580,Figure    Units of Standard Deviation
9,580,In general we do not observe the population mean or the population standard deviation of a distribution so  we need to estimate them    We estimate the population mean   using the sample mean    X  sometimes       and estimate the population standard deviation   using the sample standard deviation s      
10,580, sometimes denoted as
11,580,denoted as
12,580,There are as many different normal distributions as there are choices for mean     and variance       We can  answer all of the above questions in terms of any normal distribution  Spreadsheets for example have  functions for the normal cdf for any specification of mean and variance  For the sake of efficiency however  we would like to refer all probability statements to a single normal distribution  The standard normal  distribution  the normal distribution with       and        fills that role 
13,580,There are two steps in standardizing a random variable X  Subtract the mean of X from X then divide that  result by the standard deviation of X  If we have a list of observations on a normal random variable X we  subtract the mean from each observation to get a list of deviations from the mean then divide each deviation  by the standard deviation  The result is the standard normal random variable Z   Z is the conventional symbol  for a standard normal random variable   If we have X   N       read  X follows the normal distribution with  parameters   and      we standardize it using the formula

2,581,Suppose we have a normal random variable X with       and          We standardize X with Z    X            For example a value X       corresponds to a standardized value of   calculated as Z                       The probability that we will observe a value as small as or smaller than     for X   N       is exactly the  same as the probability that we will observe a value as small as or smaller than   for Z   N      We can  answer all probability questions about X using standardized values and probability tables for Z  We generally  do not know the population mean and standard deviation so we often use the sample mean    X for   and the  sample standard deviation s for

10,581,The following are some of the most frequently referenced values in the standard normal table 
11,581,  The   th percentile point is        P Z            N               or    percent and    percent of  values remain in the right tail 
12,581,  The   th percentile point is       P Z           N              or    percent and   percent of values  remain in the right tail  Note the difference between the use of a percentile point when dealing with one  tail rather than two tails  Earlier we used      standard deviations for the    percent confidence  interval where   percent of values lie outside that interval on each of the two sides  Here we use       because we are concerned with the   percent of values that lie only on one side the right tail 
13,581,  The   th percentile point is        P Z            N               or    percent and   percent of  values remain in the right tail 
14,581,The tables that we give for the normal cdf include probabilities for x      Many sources however give tables  only for x      How would one use such tables to find a normal probability  Because of the symmetry of the  normal distribution we can find all probabilities using tables of the cdf of the standard normal random  variable P Z   x    N x  for x      The relations below are helpful for using tables for x     as well as in  other uses

2,583,There are three steps which involve standardizing the portfolio return  First subtract the portfolio  mean return from each side of the inequality  P Portfolio return                      Second  divide each side of the inequality by the standard deviation of portfolio return  P  Portfolio return                                   P Z                N             Third recognize that on the  left hand side we have a standard normal variable denoted by Z  As we pointed out above N  x         N x   Rounding          to       for use with the excerpted table we have N              N                              roughly    percent  The probability that your portfolio will underperform the  one year risk free rate is about    percent 
3,583,We can get the answer above quickly by subtracting the mean portfolio return from     percent  dividing by the standard deviation of portfolio return and evaluating the result             with the  standard normal cdf 
4,583,     Applications of the Normal Distribution
5,583,Modern portfolio theory  MPT  makes wide use of the idea that the value of investment opportunities can be  meaningfully measured in terms of mean return and variance of return  In economic theory mean variance  analysis holds exactly when investors are risk averse  when they choose investments so as to maximize  expected utility or satisfaction  and when either    returns are normally distributed or    investors have  quadratic utility functions    Mean variance analysis can still be useful however that is it can hold  approximately when either assumption   or   is violated  Because practitioners prefer to work with  observables such as returns the proposition that returns are at least approximately normally distributed has  played a key role in much of MPT 
6,583,Mean variance analysis generally considers risk symmetrically in the sense that standard deviation captures  variability both above and below the mean    An alternative approach evaluates only downside risk  We  discuss one such approach safety first rules as it provides an excellent illustration of the application of  normal distribution theory to practical investment problems  Safety first rules focus on shortfall risk the  risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some time horizon  The risk that  the assets in a defined benefit plan will fall below plan liabilities is an example of a shortfall risk 
7,583,Suppose an investor views any return below a level of RL as unacceptable  Roy s safety first criterion states  that the optimal portfolio minimizes the probability that portfolio return RP falls below the threshold level  RL    In symbols the investor s objective is to choose a portfolio that minimizes P RP   RL   When portfolio  returns are normally distributed we can calculate P RP   RL  using the number of standard deviations that RL lies below the expected portfolio return E RP   The portfolio for which E RP    RL is largest relative to  standard deviation minimizes P RP   RL   Therefore if returns are normally distributed the safety first  optimal portfolio maximizes the safety first ratio  SFRatio  
8,583,SFRatio    E RP    RL   P
9,583,The quantity E RP    RL is the distance from the mean return to the shortfall level  Dividing this distance by   P gives the distance in units of standard deviation  There are two steps in choosing among portfolios using  Roy s criterion  assuming normality    
10,583,   Calculate each portfolio s SFRatio 
11,583,   Choose the portfolio with the highest SFRatio

2,584,For a portfolio with a given safety first ratio the probability that its return will be less than RL is N   SFRatio  and the safety first optimal portfolio has the lowest such probability  For example suppose an  investor s threshold return RL is   percent  He is presented with two portfolios  Portfolio   has an expected  return of    percent with a standard deviation of    percent  Portfolio   has an expected return of    percent  with a standard deviation of    percent  The SFRatios are                     and                    for  Portfolios   and   respectively  For the superior Portfolio   the probability that portfolio return will be less  than   percent is N              N                            or about    percent assuming that portfolio  returns are normally distributed 
3,584,You may have noticed the similarity of SFRatio to the Sharpe ratio  If we substitute the risk free rate RF for  the critical level RL the SFRatio becomes the Sharpe ratio  The safety first approach provides a new  perspective on the Sharpe ratio  When we evaluate portfolios using the Sharpe ratio the portfolio with the  highest Sharpe ratio is the one that minimizes the probability that portfolio return will be less than the risk  free rate  given a normality assumption  
4,584,EXAMPLE  
5,584,The Safety First Optimal Portfolio for a Client
6,584,You are researching asset allocations for a client in Canada with a C        portfolio  Although her  investment objective is long term growth at the end of a year she may want to liquidate C       of  the portfolio to fund educational expenses  If that need arises she would like to be able to take out the  C       without invading the initial capital of C         Table   shows three alternative  allocations

11,584,   According to the safety first criterion which of the three allocations is the best 
12,584,   What is the probability that the return on the safety first optimal portfolio will be less than the  shortfall level 
13,584,Solution to   
14,584,Because C       C        is      percent for any return less than      percent the client will  need to invade principal if she takes out C        So RL        percent

3,585,Allocation C                         
4,585,Allocation B with the largest ratio           is the best alternative according to the safety first  criterion 
5,585,Solution to   
6,585,To answer this question note that P RB           N            We can round         to      for use  with tables of the standard normal cdf  First we calculate N              N                              or about      percent  Using a spreadsheet function for the standard normal cdf on           without rounding we get       percent or about      percent  The safety first optimal portfolio has a  roughly    percent chance of not meeting a      percent return threshold 
7,585,Several points are worth noting  First if the inputs were even slightly different we could get a  different ranking  For example if the mean return on B were    rather than    percent A would be  superior to B  Second if meeting the      percent return threshold were a necessity rather than a wish  C        in one year could be modeled as a liability  Fixed income strategies such as cash flow  matching could be used to offset or immunize the C        quasi liability 
8,585,Roy s safety first rule was the earliest approach to addressing shortfall risk  The standard mean  variance portfolio selection process can also accommodate a shortfall risk constraint   
9,585,In many investment contexts besides Roy s safety first criterion we use the normal distribution to estimate a  probability  For example Kolb Gay and Hunter        developed an expression based on the standard  normal distribution for the probability that a futures trader will exhaust his liquidity because of losses in a  futures contract  Another arena in which the normal distribution plays an important role is financial risk  management  Financial institutions such as investment banks security dealers and commercial banks have  formal systems to measure and control financial risk at various levels from trading positions to the overall  risk for the firm    Two mainstays in managing financial risk are Value at Risk  VaR  and stress  testing scenario analysis  Stress testing scenario analysis a complement to VaR refers to a set of  techniques for estimating losses in extremely unfavorable combinations of events or scenarios  Value at Risk  VaR  is a money measure of the minimum value of losses expected over a specified time period  for  example a day a quarter or a year  at a given level of probability  often      or        Suppose we specify a  one day time horizon and a level of probability of      which would be called a    percent one day VaR    If this VaR equaled    million for a portfolio there would be a      probability that the portfolio would lose     million or more in a single day  assuming our assumptions were correct   One of the basic approaches to  estimating VaR the variance covariance or analytical method assumes that returns follow a normal  distribution  For more information on VaR see Chance and Brooks        
10,585,     The Lognormal Distribution
11,585,Closely related to the normal distribution the lognormal distribution is widely used for modeling the  probability distribution of share and other asset prices  For example the lognormal appears in the Black  Scholes Merton option pricing model  The Black Scholes Merton model assumes that the price of the asset  underlying the option is lognormally distributed 
12,585,A random variable Y follows a lognormal distribution if its natural logarithm ln Y is normally distributed   The reverse is also true  If the natural logarithm of random variable Y ln Y is normally distributed then Y follows a lognormal distribution  If you think of the term lognormal as  the log is normal  you will have no  trouble remembering this relationship

2,586,The two most noteworthy observations about the lognormal distribution are that it is bounded below by   and  it is skewed to the right  it has a long right tail   Note these two properties in the graphs of the pdfs of two  lognormal distributions in Figure    Asset prices are bounded from below by    In practice the lognormal  distribution has been found to be a usefully accurate description of the distribution of prices for many  financial assets  On the other hand the normal distribution is often a good approximation for returns  For this  reason both distributions are very important for finance professionals 
3,586,Figure    Two Lognormal Distributions
4,586,Like the normal distribution the lognormal distribution is completely described by two parameters  Unlike  the other distributions we have considered a lognormal distribution is defined in terms of the parameters of a  different distribution  The two parameters of a lognormal distribution are the mean and standard deviation  or  variance  of its associated normal distribution  the mean and variance of ln Y given that Y is lognormal   Remember we must keep track of two sets of means and standard deviations  or variances   the mean and  standard deviation  or variance  of the associated normal distribution  these are the parameters  and the mean  and standard deviation  or variance  of the lognormal variable itself 
5,586,The expressions for the mean and variance of the lognormal variable itself are challenging  Suppose a normal  random variable X has expected value   and variance     Define Y   exp X   Remember that the operation  indicated by exp X  or eX is the opposite operation from taking logs    Because ln Y   ln  exp X     X is  normal  we assume X is normal  Y is lognormal  What is the expected value of Y   exp X   A guess might be  that the expected value of Y is exp     The expected value is actually exp             which is larger than  exp    by a factor of exp                To get some insight into this concept think of what happens if we  increase     The distribution spreads out  it can spread upward but it cannot spread downward past    As a  result the center of its distribution is pushed to the right the distribution s mean increases   
6,586,The expressions for the mean and variance of a lognormal variable are summarized below where   and    are  the mean and variance of the associated normal distribution  refer to these expressions as needed rather than  memorizing them

2,587,We now explore the relationship between the distribution of stock return and stock price  In the following we  show that if a stock s continuously compounded return is normally distributed then future stock price is  necessarily lognormally distributed    Furthermore we show that stock price may be well described by the  lognormal distribution even when continuously compounded returns do not follow a normal distribution   These results provide the theoretical foundation for using the lognormal distribution to model prices 
3,587,To outline the presentation that follows we first show that the stock price at some future time T ST equals  the current stock price S  multiplied by e raised to power r T the continuously compounded return from   to  T  this relationship is expressed as ST   S exp r T   We then show that we can write r T as the sum of shorter  term continuously compounded returns and that if these shorter period returns are normally distributed then  r T is normally distributed  given certain assumptions  or approximately normally distributed  not making  those assumptions   As ST is proportional to the log of a normal random variable ST is lognormal 
4,587,To supply a framework for our discussion suppose we have a series of equally spaced observations on stock  price  S  S  S    ST  Current stock price S  is a known quantity and so is nonrandom  The future prices   such as S   however are random variables  The price relative S  S  is an ending price S  over a  beginning price S   it is equal to   plus the holding period return on the stock from t     to t     
5,587,S  S        R  
6,587,For example if S        and S           then S  S                       Therefore R          or    percent   In general price relatives have the form
7,587,St   St       Rtt  
8,587,where Rtt   is the rate of return from t to t     
9,587,An important concept is the continuously compounded return associated with a holding period return such as  R    The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period is the natural logarithm of    plus that holding period return or equivalently the natural logarithm of the ending price over the beginning  price  the price relative     For example if we observe a one week holding period return of      the  equivalent continuously compounded return called the one week continuously compounded return is ln                          invested for one week at          continuously compounded gives        equivalent to a   percent one week holding period return  The continuously compounded return from t to t      is
10,587,Equation    
11,587,rtt     ln St   St    ln     Rtt   
12,587,For our example r     ln S  S     ln     R      ln               ln                   Thus       percent is  the continuously compounded return from t     to t      The continuously compounded return is smaller than  the associated holding period return  If our investment horizon extends from t     to t   T then the  continuously compounded return to T is
13,587,r T   ln ST S  
14,587,Applying the function exp to both sides of the equation we have exp r T    exp ln ST S      ST S  so
15,587,ST   S exp r T 
16,587,We can also express ST S  as the product of price relatives 
17,587,ST S     ST ST    ST   ST     S  S  
18,587,Taking logs of both sides of this equation we find that continuously compounded return to time T is the sum  of the one period continuously compounded returns

2,588,Using holding period returns to find the ending value of a    investment involves the multiplication of  quantities      holding period return   Using continuously compounded returns involves addition 
3,588,A key assumption in many investment applications is that returns are independently and identically  distributed  IID   Independence captures the proposition that investors cannot predict future returns using  past returns  i e  weak form market efficiency   Identical distribution captures the assumption of  stationarity   
4,588,Assume that the one period continuously compounded returns  such as r    are IID random variables with  mean   and variance     but making no normality or other distributional assumption   Then
5,588,Equation    
6,588,E r T    E rT  T    E rT  T          E r       T
7,588, we add up   for a total of T times  and
8,588,Equation    
9,588,   r T      T
10,588, as a consequence of the independence assumption   The variance of the T holding period continuously  compounded return is T multiplied by the variance of the one period continuously compounded return  also    r T      T   If the one period continuously compounded returns on the right hand side of Equation   are  normally distributed then the T holding period continuously compounded return r T is also normally  distributed with mean  T and variance   T  This relationship is so because a linear combination of normal  random variables is also normal  But even if the one period continuously compounded returns are not normal  their sum r T is approximately normal according to a result in statistics known as the central limit  theorem    Now compare ST   S exp r T  to Y   exp X  where X is normal and Y is lognormal  as we  discussed above   Clearly we can model future stock price ST as a lognormal random variable because r T should be at least approximately normal  This assumption of normally distributed returns is the basis in theory  for the lognormal distribution as a model for the distribution of prices of shares and other assets 
11,588,Continuously compounded returns play a role in many option pricing models as mentioned earlier  An  estimate of volatility is crucial for using option pricing models such as the Black Scholes Merton model   Volatility measures the standard deviation of the continuously compounded returns on the underlying  asset    In practice we very often estimate volatility using a historical series of continuously compounded  daily returns  We gather a set of daily holding period returns and then use Equation   to convert them into  continuously compounded daily returns  We then compute the standard deviation of the continuously  compounded daily returns and annualize that number using Equation       By convention volatility is stated  as an annualized measure     Example    illustrates the estimation of volatility for the shares of Astra  International

7,590,We have shown that the distribution of stock price is lognormal given certain assumptions  What are the  mean and variance of ST if ST follows the lognormal distribution  Earlier in this section we gave bullet point  expressions for the mean and variance of a lognormal random variable  In the bullet point expressions the     
8,590,would refer in the context of this discussion to the mean and variance of the T horizon  not the  one period  continuously compounded returns  assumed to follow a normal distribution  compatible with the  horizon of ST    Related to the use of mean and variance  or standard deviation  earlier in this reading we  used those quantities to construct intervals in which we expect to find a certain percentage of the observations  of a normally distributed random variable  Those intervals were symmetric about the mean  Can we state  similar symmetric intervals for a lognormal random variable  Unfortunately we cannot  Because the  lognormal distribution is not symmetric such intervals are more complicated than for the normal distribution  and we will not discuss this specialist topic here   
9,590,Finally we have presented the relation between the mean and variance of continuously compounded returns  associated with different time horizons  see Equations   and    but how are the means and variances of  holding period returns and continuously compounded returns related  As analysts we typically think in terms  of holding period returns rather than continuously compounded returns and we may desire to convert means  and standard deviations of holding period returns to means and standard deviations of continuously  compounded returns for an option application for example  To effect such conversions  and those in the other  direction from a continuous compounding to a holding period basis  we can use the expressions in Ferguson         
10,590,   MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
11,590,With an understanding of probability distributions we are now prepared to learn about a computer based  technique in which probability distributions play an integral role  The technique is called Monte Carlo  simulation  Monte Carlo simulation in finance involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of  a complex financial system  A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large  number of random samples from a specified probability distribution or distributions to represent the role of  risk in the system 
12,590,Monte Carlo simulation has several quite distinct uses  One use is in planning  Stanford University researcher  Sam Savage provided the following neat picture of that role   What is the last thing you do before you climb  on a ladder  You shake it and that is Monte Carlo simulation     Just as shaking a ladder helps us assess the  risks in climbing it Monte Carlo simulation allows us to experiment with a proposed policy before actually  implementing it  For example investment performance can be evaluated with reference to a benchmark or a  liability  Defined benefit pension plans often invest assets with reference to plan liabilities  Pension liabilities  are a complex random process  In a Monte Carlo asset liability financial planning study the functioning of  pension assets and liabilities is simulated over time given assumptions about how assets are invested the  work force and other variables  A key specification in this and all Monte Carlo simulations is the probability  distributions of the various sources of risk  including interest rates and security market returns in this case    The implications of different investment policy decisions on the plan s funded status can be assessed through  simulated time  The experiment can be repeated for another set of assumptions  We can view Example    below as coming under this heading  In that example market return series are not long enough to address  researchers  questions on stock market timing so the researchers simulate market returns to find answers to  their questions

2,591,Monte Carlo simulation is also widely used to develop estimates of VaR  In this application we simulate the  portfolio s profit and loss performance for a specified time horizon  Repeated trials within the simulation   each trial involving a draw of random observations from a probability distribution  produce a frequency  distribution for changes in portfolio value  The point that defines the cutoff for the least favorable   percent of  simulated changes is an estimate of    percent VaR for example 
3,591,In an extremely important use Monte Carlo simulation is a tool for valuing complex securities particularly  some European style options for which no analytic pricing formula is available    For other securities such  as mortgage backed securities with complex embedded options Monte Carlo simulation is also an important  modeling resource 
4,591,Researchers use Monte Carlo simulation to test their models and tools  How critical is a particular assumption  to the performance of a model  Because we control the assumptions when we do a simulation we can run the  model through a Monte Carlo simulation to examine a model s sensitivity to a change in our assumptions 
5,591,To understand the technique of Monte Carlo simulation let us present the process as a series of steps    To  illustrate the steps we take the case of using Monte Carlo simulation to value a type of option for which no  analytic pricing formula is available an Asian call option on a stock  An Asian call option is a European  style option with a value at maturity equal to the difference between the stock price at maturity and the  average stock price during the life of the option or    whichever is greater  For instance if the final stock  price is     with an average value of     over the life of the option the value of the option at maturity is      the greater of                and      Steps   through   of the process describe specifying the simulation   Steps   through   describe running the simulation 
6,591,   Specify the quantities of interest  option value for example or the funded status of a pension plan  in  terms of underlying variables  The underlying variable or variables could be stock price for an equity  option the market value of pension assets or other variables relating to the pension benefit obligation  for a pension plan  Specify the starting values of the underlying variables 
7,591,To illustrate the steps we are using the case of valuing an Asian call option on stock  We use CiT to  represent the value of the option at maturity T  The subscript i in CiT indicates that CiT is a value  resulting from the ith simulation trial each simulation trial involving a drawing of random values  an  iteration of Step    
8,591,   Specify a time grid  Take the horizon in terms of calendar time and split it into a number of subperiods  say K in total  Calendar time divided by the number of subperiods K is the time increment  t 
9,591,   Specify distributional assumptions for the risk factors that drive the underlying variables  For example  stock price is the underlying variable for the Asian call so we need a model for stock price movement   Say we choose the following model for changes in stock price where Zk stands for the standard normal  random variable 
10,591,  Stock price         Prior stock price    t        Prior stock price   Zk 
11,591,In the way that we are using the term Zk is a risk factor in the simulation  Through our choice of   and    we control the distribution of stock price  Although this example has one risk factor a given  simulation may have multiple risk factors 
12,591,   Using a computer program or spreadsheet function draw K random values of each risk factor  In our  example the spreadsheet function would produce a draw of K values of the standard normal variable  Zk  Z  Z  Z    ZK 
13,591,   Calculate the underlying variables using the random observations generated in Step    Using the above  model of stock price dynamics the result is K observations on changes in stock price  An additional  calculation is needed to convert those changes into K stock prices  using initial stock price which is  given   Another calculation produces the average stock price during the life of the option  the sum of K stock prices divided by K

2,592,   Compute the quantities of interest  In our example the first calculation is the value of an Asian call at  maturity CiT  A second calculation discounts this terminal value back to the present to get the call value  as of today Ci   We have completed one simulation trial   The subscript i in Ci  stands for the ith  simulation trial as it does in CiT   In a Monte Carlo simulation a running tabulation is kept of statistics  relating to the distribution of the quantities of interest including their mean value and standard  deviation over the simulation trials to that point 
3,592,   Iteratively go back to Step   until a specified number of trials I is completed  Finally produce  statistics for the simulation  The key value for our example is the mean value of Ci  for the total number  of simulation trials  This mean value is the Monte Carlo estimate of the value of the Asian call 
4,592,How many simulation trials should be specified  In general we need to increase the number of trials by a  factor of     to get each extra digit of accuracy  Depending on the problem tens of thousands of trials may  be needed to obtain accuracy to two decimal places  as required for option value for example   Conducting a  large number of trials is not necessarily a problem given today s computing power  The number of trials  needed can be reduced using variance reduction procedures a topic outside the scope of this reading   
5,592,In Step   of our example a computer function produced a set of random observations on a standard normal  random variable  Recall that for a uniform distribution all possible numbers are equally likely  The term  random number generator refers to an algorithm that produces uniformly distributed random numbers  between   and    In the context of computer simulations the term random number refers to an observation  drawn from a uniform distribution    For other distributions the term  random observation  is used in this  context 
6,592,It is a remarkable fact that random observations from any distribution can be produced using the uniform  random variable with endpoints   and    To see why this is so consider the inverse transformation method of  producing random observations  Suppose we are interested in obtaining random observations for a random  variable X with cumulative distribution function F x   Recall that F x  evaluated at x is a number between    and    Suppose a random outcome of this random variable is      and that F              or    percent   Define an inverse of F call it F   that can do the following  Substitute the probability      into F   and it  returns the random outcome       In other words F                 To generate random observations on X  the steps are    generate a uniform random number r between   and   using the random number generator  and    evaluate F   r  to obtain a random observation on X  Random observation generation is a field of study  in itself and we have briefly discussed the inverse transformation method here just to illustrate a point  As a  generalist you do not need to address the technical details of converting random numbers into random  observations but you do need to know that random observations from any distribution can be generated using  a uniform random variable 
7,592,In Examples    and    we give an application of Monte Carlo simulation to a question of great interest to  investment practice  the potential gains from market timing 
8,592,EXAMPLE   
9,592,Potential Gains from Market Timing  A Monte Carlo  Simulation    
10,592,All active investors want to achieve superior performance  One possible source of superior  performance is market timing ability  How accurate does an investor need to be as a bull  and bear  market forecaster for market timing to be profitable  What size gains compared with a buy and hold  strategy accrue to a given level of accuracy  Because of the variability in asset returns a huge amount  of return data is needed to find statistically reliable answers to these questions  Chua Woodward  and To        thus selected Monte Carlo simulation to address the potential gains from market  timing  They were interested in the perspective of a Canadian investor

2,593,To understand their study suppose that at the beginning of a year an investor predicts that the next  year will see either a bull market or bear market  If the prediction is bull market the investor puts all  her money in stocks and earns the market return for that year  On the other hand if the prediction is  bear market the investor holds T bills and earns the T bill return  After the fact a market is  categorized as bull market if the stock market return RMt minus T bill return RFt is positive for the  year  otherwise the market is classed as bear market  The investment results of a market timer can be  compared with those of a buy and hold investor  A buy and hold investor earns the market return  every year  For Chua et al  one quantity of interest was the gain from market timing  They defined  this quantity as the market timer s average return minus the average return to a buy and hold investor 
3,593,To simulate market returns Chua et al  generated       random standard normal observations Zt  At  the time of the study Canadian stocks had a historical mean annual return of       percent with a  standard deviation of       percent  To reflect these parameters the simulated market returns are RMt         Zt          t                Using a second set of       random standard normal  observations historical return parameters for Canadian T bills as well as the historical correlation of  T bill and stock returns the authors generated       T bill returns 
4,593,An investor can have different skills in forecasting bull and bear markets  Chua et al  characterized  market timers by accuracy in forecasting bull markets and accuracy in forecasting bear markets  For  example bull market forecasting accuracy of    percent means that when the timer forecasts bull  market for the next year she is right just half the time indicating no skill  Suppose an investor has     percent accuracy in forecasting bull market and    percent accuracy in forecasting bear market  a        timer   We can simulate how an investor would fare  After generating the first observation on RMt   RFt we know whether that observation is a bull or bear market  If the observation is bull market then       forecast accuracy for bull markets  is compared with a random number  between   and      If the random number is less than      which occurs with a    percent probability then the market  timer is assumed to have correctly predicted bull market and her return for that first observation is the  market return  If the random number is greater than      then the market timer is assumed to have  made an error and predicted bear market  her return for that observation is the risk free rate  In a  similar fashion if that first observation is bear market the timer has an    percent chance of being  right in forecasting bear market based on a random number draw  In either case her return is  compared with the market return to record her gain versus a buy and hold strategy  That process is  one simulation trial  The simulated mean return earned by the timer is the average return earned by the  timer over all trials in the simulation 
5,593,To increase our understanding of the process consider a hypothetical Monte Carlo simulation with  four trials for the       timer  who to reiterate has    percent accuracy in forecasting bull markets  and    percent accuracy in forecasting bear markets   Table   gives data for the simulation  Let us  look at Trials   and    In Trial   the first random number drawn leads to a market return of         Because the market return       exceeded the T bill return       we have a bull market  We  generate a random number       which we then compare with the timer s bull market accuracy        Because       is less than      the timer is assumed to have made a correct bull market forecast  and thus to have invested in stocks  Thus the timer earns the stock market return       for that trial   In the second trial we observe another bull market but because the random number       is greater  than      the timer is assumed to have made an error and predicted a bear market  therefore the timer  earned the T bill return       rather than higher stock market return

5,595,The authors concluded that the cost of not being invested in the market during bull market years is  high  Because a buy and hold investor never misses a bull market year she has     percent forecast  accuracy for bull markets  at the cost of   percent accuracy for bear markets   Given their definitions  and assumptions the authors also concluded that successful market timing requires a minimum  accuracy of    percent in forecasting both bull and bear markets  Market timing is a continuing area  of interest and study and other perspectives exist  However this example illustrates how Monte Carlo  simulation is used to address important investment issues 
6,595,The analyst chooses the probability distributions in Monte Carlo simulation  By contrast historical  simulation samples from a historical record of returns  or other underlying variables  to simulate a process   The concept underlying historical simulation  also called back simulation  is that the historical record  provides the most direct evidence on distributions  and that the past applies to the future   For example refer  back to Step   in the outline of Monte Carlo simulation above and suppose the time increment is one day   Further suppose we base the simulation on the record of daily stock returns over the last five years  In one  type of historical simulation we randomly draw K returns from that record to generate one simulation trial   We put back the observations into the sample and in the next trial we again randomly sample with  replacement  The simulation results directly reflect frequencies in the data  A drawback of this approach is  that any risk not represented in the time period selected  for example a stock market crash  will not be  reflected in the simulation  Compared with Monte Carlo simulation historical simulation does not lend itself  to  what if  analyses  Nevertheless historic simulation is an established alternative simulation methodology 
7,595,Monte Carlo simulation is a complement to analytical methods  It provides only statistical estimates not  exact results  Analytical methods where available provide more insight into cause and effect relationships   For example the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model for the value of a European call option is an  analytical method expressed as a formula  It is a much more efficient method for valuing such a call than is  Monte Carlo simulation  As an analytical expression the Black Scholes Merton model permits the analyst to  quickly gauge the sensitivity of call value to changes in current stock price and the other variables that  determine call value  In contrast Monte Carlo simulations do not directly provide such precise insights   However only some types of options can be priced with analytical expressions  As financial product  innovations proceed the field of applications for Monte Carlo simulation continues to grow 
8,595,SUMMARY
9,595,In this reading we have presented the most frequently used probability distributions in investment analysis  and the Monte Carlo simulation 
10,595,  A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable

2,596,  The two basic types of random variables are discrete random variables and continuous random  variables  Discrete random variables take on at most a countable number of possible outcomes that we  can list as x  x    In contrast we cannot describe the possible outcomes of a continuous random  variable Z with a list z  z    because the outcome  z    z     not in the list would always be possible 
3,596,  The probability function specifies the probability that the random variable will take on a specific value   The probability function is denoted p x  for a discrete random variable and f x  for a continuous  random variable  For any probability function p x      p x      and the sum of p x  over all values of  X equals   
4,596,  The cumulative distribution function denoted F x  for both continuous and discrete random variables  gives the probability that the random variable is less than or equal to x 
5,596,  The discrete uniform and the continuous uniform distributions are the distributions of equally likely  outcomes 
6,596,  The binomial random variable is defined as the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials where the  probability of success p is constant for all trials and the trials are independent  A Bernoulli trial is an  experiment with two outcomes which can represent success or failure an up move or a down move or  another binary  two fold  outcome 
7,596,  A binomial random variable has an expected value or mean equal to np and variance equal to np     p  
8,596,  A binomial tree is the graphical representation of a model of asset price dynamics in which at each  period the asset moves up with probability p or down with probability      p   The binomial tree is a  flexible method for modeling asset price movement and is widely used in pricing options 
9,596,  The normal distribution is a continuous symmetric probability distribution that is completely described  by two parameters  its mean   and its variance    
10,596,  A univariate distribution specifies the probabilities for a single random variable  A multivariate  distribution specifies the probabilities for a group of related random variables 
11,596,  To specify the normal distribution for a portfolio when its component securities are normally  distributed we need the means standard deviations and all the distinct pairwise correlations of the  securities  When we have those statistics we have also specified a multivariate normal distribution for  the securities 
12,596,  For a normal random variable approximately    percent of all possible outcomes are within a one  standard deviation interval about the mean approximately    percent are within a two standard  deviation interval about the mean and approximately    percent are within a three standard deviation  interval about the mean 
13,596,  A normal random variable X is standardized using the expression Z    X        where   and   are the  mean and standard deviation of X  Generally we use the sample mean    X as an estimate of   and the  sample standard deviation s as an estimate of   in this expression 
14,596,  The standard normal random variable denoted Z has a mean equal to   and variance equal to    All  questions about any normal random variable can be answered by referring to the cumulative  distribution function of a standard normal random variable denoted N x  or N z  
15,596,  Shortfall risk is the risk that portfolio value will fall below some minimum acceptable level over some  time horizon 
16,596,  Roy s safety first criterion addressing shortfall risk asserts that the optimal portfolio is the one that  minimizes the probability that portfolio return falls below a threshold level  According to Roy s safety  first criterion if returns are normally distributed the safety first optimal portfolio P is the one that  maximizes the quantity  E RP    RL   P where RL is the minimum acceptable level of return

2,597,  A random variable follows a lognormal distribution if the natural logarithm of the random variable is  normally distributed  The lognormal distribution is defined in terms of the mean and variance of its  associated normal distribution  The lognormal distribution is bounded below by   and skewed to the  right  it has a long right tail  
3,597,  The lognormal distribution is frequently used to model the probability distribution of asset prices  because it is bounded below by zero 
4,597,  Continuous compounding views time as essentially continuous or unbroken  discrete compounding  views time as advancing in discrete finite intervals 
5,597,  The continuously compounded return associated with a holding period is the natural log of   plus the  holding period return or equivalently the natural log of ending price over beginning price 
6,597,  If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed asset prices are lognormally distributed   This relationship is used to move back and forth between the distributions for return and price  Because  of the central limit theorem continuously compounded returns need not be normally distributed for  asset prices to be reasonably well described by a lognormal distribution 
7,597,  Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of a complex  financial system  A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large number  of random samples from specified probability distribution s  to represent the operation of risk in the  system  Monte Carlo simulation is used in planning in financial risk management and in valuing  complex securities  Monte Carlo simulation is a complement to analytical methods but provides only  statistical estimates not exact results 
8,597,  Historical simulation is an established alternative to Monte Carlo simulation that in one implementation  involves repeated sampling from a historical data series  Historical simulation is grounded in actual  data but can reflect only risks represented in the sample historical data  Compared with Monte Carlo  simulation historical simulation does not lend itself to  what if  analyses

3,600,    In futures markets profits or losses on contracts are settled at the end of each trading day  This  procedure is called marking to market or daily resettlement  By preventing a trader s losses from  accumulating over many days marking to market reduces the risk that traders will default on their  obligations  A futures markets trader needs a liquidity pool to meet the daily mark to market  If  liquidity is exhausted the trader may be forced to unwind his position at an unfavorable time 
4,600,Suppose you are using financial futures contracts to hedge a risk in your portfolio  You have a liquidity  pool  cash and cash equivalents  of   dollars per contract and a time horizon of T trading days  For a  given size liquidity pool   Kolb Gay and Hunter        developed an expression for the probability  stating that you will exhaust your liquidity pool within a T day horizon as a result of the daily mark to  market  Kolb et al  assumed that the expected change in futures price is   and that futures price changes  are normally distributed  With   representing the standard deviation of daily futures price changes the  standard deviation of price changes over a time horizon to day T is   T  given continuous  compounding  With that background the Kolb et al  expression is
5,600,Probability of exhausting liquidity pool         N x    where x         T    Here x is a standardized value of    N x  is the standard normal cumulative  distribution function  For some intuition about     N x  in the expression note that the liquidity pool is  exhausted if losses exceed the size of the liquidity pool at any time up to and including T  the  probability of that event happening can be shown to be proportional to an area in the right tail of a  standard normal distribution     N x  
6,600,Using the Kolb et al  expression answer the following questions 
7,600,A  Your hedging horizon is five days and your liquidity pool is       per contract  You estimate  that the standard deviation of daily price changes for the contract is       What is the probability  that you will exhaust your liquidity pool in the five day period 
8,600,B  Suppose your hedging horizon is    days but all the other facts given in Part A remain the same   What is the probability that you will exhaust your liquidity pool in the    day period

11,608,A  The probability of exhausting the liquidity pool is     percent  First calculate  x         T                                 We can round this value to      to use the  standard normal tables in the back of this book  Using those tables we find that N                  Thus the probability of exhausting the liquidity pool is       N                                  or about     percent 
12,608,B  The probability of exhausting the liquidity pool is now      percent  The calculation follows the  same steps as those in Part A  We calculate x         T                                   We can round this value to      to use the standard normal tables in the back of this book  Using  those tables we find that N                 Thus the probability of exhausting the liquidity pool  is       N                                 or about      percent  This is a substantial probability  that you will run out of funds to meet mark to market

14,608,    B is correct  The normal distribution has a skewness of   a kurtosis of   and a mean median and  mode that are all equal 
15,608,    B is correct  Multivariate distributions specify the probabilities for a group of related random variables   A portfolio of technology stocks represents a group of related assets  Accordingly statistical  interrelationships must be considered resulting in the need to use a multivariate normal distribution

2,609,C  To answer this question note that P RC          N          We can round       to      for use  with tables of the standard normal cdf  First we calculate N              N                              or about    percent  The safety first optimal portfolio has a roughly    percent chance of  not meeting a     percent return threshold 
3,609,    A is correct  P      Portfolio return          N Z corresponding to        N Z corresponding to       For the first term Z                         approximately and using the table of cumulative  normal distribution given in the problem N                 To get the second term immediately note  that   percent is the mean and for the normal distribution    percent of the probability lies on either  side of the mean  Therefore N Z corresponding to     must equal    percent  So P      Portfolio  return                                 or approximately     percent 
4,609,    B is correct  There are three steps which involve standardizing the portfolio return  First subtract the  portfolio mean return from each side of the inequality  P Portfolio return                   Second  divide each side of the inequality by the standard deviation of portfolio return  P  Portfolio return                               P Z              N           Third recognize that on the left hand  side we have a standard normal variable denoted by Z and N  x        N x   Rounding         to        for use with the cumulative distribution function  cdf  table we have N              N                             approximately    percent  The probability that the portfolio will underperform the  target is about    percent

6,609,A  Elements that should appear in a definition of Monte Carlo simulation are that it makes use of a  computer  that it is used to represent the operation of a complex system or in some applications  to find an approximate solution to a problem  and that it involves the generation of a large  number of random samples from a specified probability distribution  The exact wording can vary  but one definition follows 
7,609,Monte Carlo simulation in finance involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of a  complex financial system  In some important applications Monte Carlo simulation is used to find  an approximate solution to a complex financial problem  An integral part of Monte Carlo  simulation is the generation of a large number of random samples from a probability distribution 
8,609,B  Strengths  Monte Carlo simulation can be used to price complex securities for which no analytic  expression is available particularly European style options 
9,609,Weaknesses  Monte Carlo simulation provides only statistical estimates not exact results   Analytic methods when available provide more insight into cause and effect relationships than  does Monte Carlo simulation 
10,609,    In the text we described how we could use Monte Carlo simulation to value an Asian option a  complex European style option  Just as we can calculate the average value of the stock over a  simulation trial to value an Asian option we can also calculate the minimum value of the stock over a  simulation trial  Then for a given simulation trial we can calculate the terminal value of the call given  the minimum value of the stock for the simulation trial  We can then discount back this terminal value  to the present to get the value of the call today  t       The average of these t     values over all  simulation trials is the Monte Carlo simulated value of the lookback call option 
11,609,    C is correct  The rate of return is a random variable because the future outcomes are uncertain and it is  continuous because it can take on an unlimited number of outcomes 
12,609,    B is correct  The function g x  satisfies the conditions of a probability function  All of the values of g x   are between   and   and the values of g x  all sum to   
13,609,    A is correct  The probability that X will take on a value of   or less is  F      P X        p      p      p       p            The probability that X will take on a value of   or less is  F      P X        p      p       p            So the probability that X will take on a value of   is  F      F      p            The  probability of X     can be found using the same logic  F      F      p                          The  probability of X taking on a value of   or   is  p      p

8,610,    C is correct  A characteristic feature of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large number of  random samples from a specified probability distribution or distributions to represent the role of risk in  the system

10,610,    B is correct  A normal distribution has a skewness of zero  it is symmetrical around the mean   A non  zero skewness implies asymmetry in a distribution 
11,610,    A is correct  The chance of a negative return falls in the area to the left of    under a standard normal  curve  By standardizing the returns and standard deviations of the two assets the likelihood of either  asset experiencing a negative return may be determined  Z score  standardized value     X       
12,610,Z score for a bond return of

14,610,For bonds a    return falls      standard deviations below the mean return of     In contrast for  stocks a    return falls      standard deviations below the mean return of      A standard deviation  of      is less than a standard deviation of       Negative returns thus occupy more of the left tail of the  bond distribution than the stock distribution  Thus bonds are more likely than stocks to experience a  negative return 
15,610,    B is correct  Allocation B has the highest safety first ratio  The threshold return level RL for the  portfolio is                        thus any return less than RL        will invade the portfolio  principal  To compute the allocation that is safety first optimal select the alternative with the highest  ratio

2,615,   INTRODUCTION
3,615,Each day we observe the high low and close of stock market indexes from around the world   Indexes such as the S P     Index and the Nikkei Dow Jones Average are samples of stocks   Although the S P     and the Nikkei do not represent the populations of US or Japanese  stocks we view them as valid indicators of the whole population s behavior  As analysts we  are accustomed to using this sample information to assess how various markets from around the  world are performing  Any statistics that we compute with sample information however are  only estimates of the underlying population parameters  A sample then is a subset of the  population a subset studied to infer conclusions about the population itself 
4,615,This reading explores how we sample and use sample information to estimate population  parameters  In the next section we discuss sampling the process of obtaining a sample  In  investments we continually make use of the mean as a measure of central tendency of random  variables such as return and earnings per share  Even when the probability distribution of the  random variable is unknown we can make probability statements about the population mean  using the central limit theorem  In Section   we discuss and illustrate this key result  Following  that discussion we turn to statistical estimation  Estimation seeks precise answers to the  question  What is this parameter s value  
5,615,The central limit theorem and estimation are the core of the body of methods presented in this  reading  In investments we apply these and other statistical techniques to financial data  we  often interpret the results for the purpose of deciding what works and what does not work in  investments  We end this reading with a discussion of the interpretation of statistical results  based on financial data and the possible pitfalls in this process 
6,615,   SAMPLING
7,615,In this section we present the various methods for obtaining information on a population  all  members of a specified group  through samples  part of the population   The information on a  population that we try to obtain usually concerns the value of a parameter a quantity  computed from or used to describe a population of data  When we use a sample to estimate a  parameter we make use of sample statistics  statistics for short   A statistic is a quantity  computed from or used to describe a sample of data 
8,615,We take samples for one of two reasons  In some cases we cannot possibly examine every  member of the population  In other cases examining every member of the population would not  be economically efficient  Thus savings of time and money are two primary factors that cause  an analyst to use sampling to answer a question about a population  In this section we discuss  two methods of random sampling  simple random sampling and stratified random sampling  We  then define and illustrate the two types of data an analyst uses  cross sectional data and time  series data

2,616,     Simple Random Sampling
3,616,Suppose a telecommunications equipment analyst wants to know how much major customers  will spend on average for equipment during the coming year  One strategy is to survey the  population of telecom equipment customers and inquire what their purchasing plans are  In  statistical terms the characteristics of the population of customers  planned expenditures would  then usually be expressed by descriptive measures such as the mean and variance  Surveying all  companies however would be very costly in terms of time and money 
4,616,Alternatively the analyst can collect a representative sample of companies and survey them  about upcoming telecom equipment expenditures  In this case the analyst will compute the  sample mean expenditure    X  a statistic  This strategy has a substantial advantage over polling  the whole population because it can be accomplished more quickly and at lower cost 
5,616,Sampling however introduces error  The error arises because not all the companies in the  population are surveyed  The analyst who decides to sample is trading time and money for  sampling error 
6,616,When an analyst chooses to sample he must formulate a sampling plan  A sampling plan is  the set of rules used to select a sample  The basic type of sample from which we can draw  statistically sound conclusions about a population is the simple random sample  random  sample for short  
7,616,  Definition of Simple Random Sample  A simple random sample is a subset of a larger  population created in such a way that each element of the population has an equal  probability of being selected to the subset 
8,616,The procedure of drawing a sample to satisfy the definition of a simple random sample is called  simple random sampling  How is simple random sampling carried out  We need a method  that ensures randomness the lack of any pattern in the selection of the sample  For a finite   limited  population the most common method for obtaining a random sample involves the use  of random numbers  numbers with assured properties of randomness   First we number the  members of the population in sequence  For example if the population contains     members  we number them in sequence with three digits starting with     and ending with      Suppose  we want a simple random sample of size     In that case using a computer random number  generator or a table of random numbers we generate a series of three digit random numbers   We then match these random numbers with the number codes of the population members until  we have selected a sample of size    
9,616,Sometimes we cannot code  or even identify  all the members of a population  We often use  systematic sampling in such cases  With systematic sampling we select every kth member  until we have a sample of the desired size  The sample that results from this procedure should  be approximately random  Real sampling situations may require that we take an approximately  random sample 
10,616,Suppose the telecommunications equipment analyst polls a random sample of telecom  equipment customers to determine the average equipment expenditure  The sample mean will  provide the analyst with an estimate of the population mean expenditure  Any difference  between the sample mean and the population mean is called sampling error 
11,616,  Definition of Sampling Error  Sampling error is the difference between the observed  value of a statistic and the quantity it is intended to estimate

2,617,A random sample reflects the properties of the population in an unbiased way and sample  statistics such as the sample mean computed on the basis of a random sample are valid  estimates of the underlying population parameters 
3,617,A sample statistic is a random variable  In other words not only do the original data from the  population have a distribution but so does the sample statistic 
4,617,This distribution is the statistic s sampling distribution 
5,617,  Definition of Sampling Distribution of a Statistic  The sampling distribution of a  statistic is the distribution of all the distinct possible values that the statistic can assume  when computed from samples of the same size randomly drawn from the same  population 
6,617,In the case of the sample mean for example we refer to the  sampling distribution of the  sample mean  or the distribution of the sample mean  We will have more to say about sampling  distributions later in this reading  Next however we look at another sampling method that is  useful in investment analysis 
7,617,     Stratified Random Sampling
8,617,The simple random sampling method just discussed may not be the best approach in all  situations  One frequently used alternative is stratified random sampling 
9,617,  Definition of Stratified Random Sampling  In stratified random sampling the  population is divided into subpopulations  strata  based on one or more classification  criteria  Simple random samples are then drawn from each stratum in sizes proportional  to the relative size of each stratum in the population  These samples are then pooled to  form a stratified random sample 
10,617,In contrast to simple random sampling stratified random sampling guarantees that population  subdivisions of interest are represented in the sample  Another advantage is that estimates of  parameters produced from stratified sampling have greater precision that is smaller variance  or dispersion than estimates obtained from simple random sampling 
11,617,Bond indexing is one area in which stratified sampling is frequently applied  Indexing is an  investment strategy in which an investor constructs a portfolio to mirror the performance of a  specified index  In pure bond indexing also called the full replication approach the investor  attempts to fully replicate an index by owning all the bonds in the index in proportion to their  market value weights  Many bond indexes consist of thousands of issues however so pure  bond indexing is difficult to implement  In addition transaction costs would be high because  many bonds do not have liquid markets  Although a simple random sample could be a solution  to the cost problem the sample would probably not match the index s major risk  factors interest rate sensitivity for example  Because the major risk factors of fixed income  portfolios are well known and quantifiable stratified sampling offers a more effective approach   In this approach we divide the population of index bonds into groups of similar duration   interest rate sensitivity  cash flow distribution sector credit quality and call exposure  We  refer to each group as a stratum or cell  a term frequently used in this context   Then we choose  a sample from each stratum proportional to the relative market weighting of the stratum in the  index to be replicated

2,618,EXAMPLE  
3,618,Bond Indexes and Stratified Sampling
4,618,Suppose you are the manager of a mutual fund indexed to the Lehman Brothers  Government Index  You are exploring several approaches to indexing including a  stratified sampling approach  You first distinguish agency bonds from US Treasury  bonds  For each of these two groups you define    maturity intervals   to   years   to    years   to   years   to   years   to   years   to    years    to    years    to     years    to    years and    to    years and also separate the bonds with coupons   annual interest rates  of   percent or less from the bonds with coupons of more than    percent 
5,618,   How many cells or strata does this sampling plan entail 
6,618,   If you use this sampling plan what is the minimum number of issues the indexed  portfolio can have 
7,618,   Suppose that in selecting among the securities that qualify for selection within  each cell you apply a criterion concerning the liquidity of the security s market   Is the sample obtained random  Explain your answer 
8,618,Solution to   
9,618,We have   issuer classifications    maturity classifications and   coupon  classifications  So in total this plan entails               different strata or cells   This  answer is an application of the multiplication rule of counting discussed in the reading  on probability concepts  
10,618,Solution to   
11,618,You cannot have fewer than one issue for each cell so the portfolio must include at least     issues 
12,618,Solution to   
13,618,If you apply any additional criteria to the selection of securities for the cells not every  security that might be included has an equal probability of being selected  As a result  the sampling is not random  In practice indexing using stratified sampling usually does  not strictly involve random sampling because the selection of bond issues within cells is  subject to various additional criteria  Because the purpose of sampling in this application  is not to make an inference about a population parameter but rather to index a portfolio  lack of randomness is not in itself a problem in this application of stratified sampling 
14,618,In the next section we discuss the kinds of data used by financial analysts in sampling and  practical issues that arise in selecting samples

2,619,     Time Series and Cross Sectional Data
3,619,Investment analysts commonly work with both time series and cross sectional data  A time  series is a sequence of returns collected at discrete and equally spaced intervals of time  such as  a historical series of monthly stock returns   Cross sectional data are data on some characteristic  of individuals groups geographical regions or companies at a single point in time  The       year end book value per share for all New York Stock Exchange listed companies is an  example of cross sectional data 
4,619,Economic or financial theory offers no basis for determining whether a long or short time  period should be selected to collect a sample  As analysts we might have to look for subtle  clues  For example combining data from a period of fixed exchange rates with data from a  period of floating exchange rates would be inappropriate  The variance of exchange rates when  exchange rates were fixed would certainly be less than when rates were allowed to float  As a  consequence we would not be sampling from a population described by a single set of  parameters   Tight versus loose monetary policy also influences the distribution of returns to  stocks  thus combining data from tight money and loose money periods would be  inappropriate  Example   illustrates the problems that can arise when sampling from more than  one distribution 
5,619,EXAMPLE  
6,619,Calculating Sharpe Ratios  One or Two Years  of Quarterly Data
7,619,Analysts often use the Sharpe ratio to evaluate the performance of a managed portfolio   The Sharpe ratio is the average return in excess of the risk free rate divided by the  standard deviation of returns  This ratio measures the excess return earned per unit of  standard deviation of return 
8,619,To compute the Sharpe ratio suppose that an analyst collects eight quarterly excess  returns  i e  total return in excess of the risk free rate   During the first year the  investment manager of the portfolio followed a low risk strategy and during the second  year the manager followed a high risk strategy  For each of these years the analyst also  tracks the quarterly excess returns of some benchmark against which the manager will  be evaluated  For each of the two years the Sharpe ratio for the benchmark is        Table   gives the calculation of the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio

2,620,Year    Quarter Measure Excess Returns Quarter     Quarterly average    Quarterly standard deviation       Sharpe ratio                          
3,620,Year    Excess Returns             
4,620,For the first year during which the manager followed a low risk strategy the average  quarterly return in excess of the risk free rate was   percent with a standard deviation of       percent  The Sharpe ratio is thus                The second year s results mirror the  first year except for the higher average return and volatility  The Sharpe ratio for the  second year is                 The Sharpe ratio for the benchmark is      during the  first and second years  Because larger Sharpe ratios are better than smaller ones   providing more return per unit of risk  the manager appears to have outperformed the  benchmark 
5,620,Now suppose the analyst believes a larger sample to be superior to a small one  She  thus decides to pool the two years together and calculate a Sharpe ratio based on eight  quarterly observations  The average quarterly excess return for the two years is the  average of each year s average excess return  For the two year period the average  excess return is                 percent per quarter  The standard deviation for all eight  quarters measured from the sample mean of     percent is       percent  The portfolio s  Sharpe ratio for the two year period is now                    the Sharpe ratio for the  benchmark remains       Thus when returns for the two year period are pooled the  manager appears to have provided less return per unit of risk than the benchmark and  less when compared with the separate yearly results 
6,620,The problem with using eight quarters of return data is that the analyst has violated the  assumption that the sampled returns come from the same population  As a result of the  change in the manager s investment strategy returns in Year   followed a different  distribution than returns in Year    Clearly during Year   returns were generated by an  underlying population with lower mean and variance than the population of the second  year  Combining the results for the first and second years yielded a sample that was  representative of no population  Because the larger sample did not satisfy model  assumptions any conclusions the analyst reached based on the larger sample are  incorrect  For this example she was better off using a smaller sample than a larger  sample because the smaller sample represented a more homogeneous distribution of  returns 
7,620,The second basic type of data is cross sectional data   With cross sectional data the  observations in the sample represent a characteristic of individuals groups geographical  regions or companies at a single point in time  The telecommunications analyst discussed  previously is essentially collecting a cross section of planned capital expenditures for the  coming year

2,621,Whenever we sample cross sectionally certain assumptions must be met if we wish to  summarize the data in a meaningful way  Again a useful approach is to think of the observation  of interest as a random variable that comes from some underlying population with a given mean  and variance  As we collect our sample and begin to summarize the data we must be sure that  all the data do in fact come from the same underlying population  For example an analyst  might be interested in how efficiently companies use their inventory assets  Some companies  however turn over their inventory more quickly than others because of differences in their  operating environments  e g  grocery stores turn over inventory more quickly than automobile  manufacturers in general   So the distribution of inventory turnover rates may not be  characterized by a single distribution with a given mean and variance  Therefore summarizing  inventory turnover across all companies might be inappropriate  If random variables are  generated by different underlying distributions the sample statistics computed from combined  samples are not related to one underlying population parameter  The size of the sampling error  in such cases is unknown 
3,621,In instances such as these analysts often summarize company level data by industry   Attempting to summarize by industry partially addresses the problem of differing underlying  distributions but large corporations are likely to be in more than one industrial sector so  analysts should be sure they understand how companies are assigned to the industry groups 
4,621,Whether we deal with time series data or cross sectional data we must be sure to have a  random sample that is representative of the population we wish to study  With the objective of  inferring information from representative samples we now turn to the next part of this reading  which focuses on the central limit theorem as well as point and interval estimates of the  population mean 
5,621,   DISTRIBUTION OF THE SAMPLE MEAN
6,621,Earlier in this reading we presented a telecommunications equipment analyst who decided to  sample in order to estimate mean planned capital expenditures by his customers  Supposing that  the sample is representative of the underlying population how can the analyst assess the  sampling error in estimating the population mean  Viewed as a formula that takes a function of  the random outcomes of a random variable the sample mean is itself a random variable with a  probability distribution  That probability distribution is called the statistic s sampling  distribution   To estimate how closely the sample mean can be expected to match the  underlying population mean the analyst needs to understand the sampling distribution of the  mean  Fortunately we have a result the central limit theorem that helps us understand the  sampling distribution of the mean for many of the estimation problems we face 
7,621,     The Central Limit Theorem
8,621,One of the most practically useful theorems in probability theory the central limit theorem has  important implications for how we construct confidence intervals and test hypotheses   Formally it is stated as follows

2,622,  The Central Limit Theorem  Given a population described by any probability  distribution having mean   and finite variance    the sampling distribution of the sample  mean    X computed from samples of size n from this population will be approximately  normal with mean    the population mean  and variance    n  the population variance  divided by n  when the sample size n is large 
3,622,The central limit theorem allows us to make quite precise probability statements about the  population mean by using the sample mean whatever the distribution of the population  so long  as it has finite variance  because the sample mean follows an approximate normal distribution  for large size samples  The obvious question is  When is a sample s size large enough that we  can assume the sample mean is normally distributed   In general when sample size n is greater  than or equal to    we can assume that the sample mean is approximately normally  distributed  
4,622,The central limit theorem states that the variance of the distribution of the sample mean is    n   The positive square root of variance is standard deviation  The standard deviation of a sample  statistic is known as the standard error of the statistic  The standard error of the sample mean is  an important quantity in applying the central limit theorem in practice 
5,622,  Definition of the Standard Error of the Sample Mean  For sample mean    X calculated  from a sample generated by a population with standard deviation   the standard error of  the sample mean is given by one of two expressions

15,622,when we do not know the population standard deviation and need to use the sample  standard deviation s to estimate it  
16,622,In practice we almost always need to use Equation    The estimate of s is given by the square  root of the sample variance s  calculated as follows

23,622,We will soon see how we can use the sample mean and its standard error to make probability  statements about the population mean by using the technique of confidence intervals  First  however we provide an illustration of the central limit theorem s force 
24,622,EXAMPLE

2,623,The Central Limit Theorem
3,623,It is remarkable that the sample mean for large sample sizes will be distributed normally  regardless of the distribution of the underlying population  To illustrate the central limit  theorem in action we specify in this example a distinctly nonnormal distribution and use  it to generate a large number of random samples of size      We then calculate the  sample mean for each sample  The frequency distribution of the calculated sample  means is an approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean for that  sample size  Does that sampling distribution look like a normal distribution 
4,623,We return to the telecommunications analyst studying the capital expenditure plans of  telecom businesses  Suppose that capital expenditures for communications equipment  form a continuous uniform random variable with a lower bound equal to    and an  upper bound equal to      for short call this a uniform         random variable  The  probability function of this continuous uniform random variable has a rather simple  shape that is anything but normal  It is a horizontal line with a vertical intercept equal to         Unlike a normal random variable for which outcomes close to the mean are most  likely all possible outcomes are equally likely for a uniform random variable 
5,623,To illustrate the power of the central limit theorem we conduct a Monte Carlo  simulation to study the capital expenditure plans of telecom businesses   In this  simulation we collect     random samples of the capital expenditures of     companies       random draws each consisting of the capital expenditures of     companies with n         In each simulation trial     values for capital expenditure are generated from  the uniform         distribution  For each random sample we then compute the sample  mean  We conduct     simulation trials in total  Because we have specified the  distribution generating the samples we know that the population mean capital  expenditure is equal to            million          million  the population variance of  capital expenditures is equal to                         thus the standard deviation is         million and the standard error is                    under the central limit  theorem  
6,623,The results of this Monte Carlo experiment are tabulated in Table   in the form of a  frequency distribution  This distribution is the estimated sampling distribution of the  sample mean

14,624,Note     X is the mean capital expenditure for each sample 
15,624,The frequency distribution can be described as bell shaped and centered close to the  population mean of     The most frequent or modal range with    observations is       to     The overall average of the sample means is        with a standard error  equal to        The calculated standard error is close to the value of       given by the  central limit theorem  The discrepancy between calculated and expected values of the  mean and standard deviation under the central limit theorem is a result of random  chance  sampling error  
16,624,In summary although the distribution of the underlying population is very nonnormal  the simulation has shown that a normal distribution well describes the estimated  sampling distribution of the sample mean with mean and standard error consistent with  the values predicted by the central limit theorem 
17,624,To summarize according to the central limit theorem when we sample from any distribution  the distribution of the sample mean will have the following properties as long as our sample  size is large 
18,624,  The distribution of the sample mean    X will be approximately normal 
19,624,  The mean of the distribution of    X will be equal to the mean of the population from which  the samples are drawn 
20,624,  The variance of the distribution of    X will be equal to the variance of the population  divided by the sample size 
21,624,We next discuss the concepts and tools related to estimating the population parameters with a  special focus on the population mean  We focus on the population mean because analysts are  more likely to meet interval estimates for the population mean than any other type of interval  estimate

2,625,   POINT AND INTERVAL ESTIMATES OF THE  POPULATION MEAN
3,625,Statistical inference traditionally consists of two branches hypothesis testing and estimation   Hypothesis testing addresses the question  Is the value of this parameter  say a population  mean  equal to some specific value    for example    In this process we have a hypothesis  concerning the value of a parameter and we seek to determine whether the evidence from a  sample supports or does not support that hypothesis  We discuss hypothesis testing in detail in  the reading on hypothesis testing 
4,625,The second branch of statistical inference and the focus of this reading is estimation   Estimation seeks an answer to the question  What is this parameter s  for example the  population mean s  value   In estimating unlike in hypothesis testing we do not start with a  hypothesis about a parameter s value and seek to test it  Rather we try to make the best use of  the information in a sample to form one of several types of estimates of the parameter s value   With estimation we are interested in arriving at a rule for best calculating a single number to  estimate the unknown population parameter  a point estimate   Together with calculating a  point estimate we may also be interested in calculating a range of values that brackets the  unknown population parameter with some specified level of probability  a confidence interval    In Section     we discuss point estimates of parameters and then in Section     the formulation  of confidence intervals for the population mean 
5,625,     Point Estimators
6,625,An important concept introduced in this reading is that sample statistics viewed as formulas  involving random outcomes are random variables  The formulas that we use to compute the  sample mean and all the other sample statistics are examples of estimation formulas or  estimators  The particular value that we calculate from sample observations using an estimator  is called an estimate  An estimator has a sampling distribution  an estimate is a fixed number  pertaining to a given sample and thus has no sampling distribution  To take the example of the  mean the calculated value of the sample mean in a given sample used as an estimate of the  population mean is called a point estimate of the population mean  As Example   illustrated  the formula for the sample mean can and will yield different results in repeated samples as  different samples are drawn from the population 
7,625,In many applications we have a choice among a number of possible estimators for estimating a  given parameter  How do we make our choice  We often select estimators because they have  one or more desirable statistical properties  Following is a brief description of three desirable  properties of estimators  unbiasedness  lack of bias  efficiency and consistency  
8,625,  Definition of Unbiasedness  An unbiased estimator is one whose expected value  the  mean of its sampling distribution  equals the parameter it is intended to estimate

2,626,For example the expected value of the sample mean    X  equals   the population mean so we  say that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator  of the population mean   The sample  variance s  which is calculated using a divisor of n      Equation    is an unbiased estimator  of the population variance     If we were to calculate the sample variance using a divisor of n the estimator would be biased  Its expected value would be smaller than the population  variance  We would say that sample variance calculated with a divisor of n is a biased estimator  of the population variance 
3,626,Whenever one unbiased estimator of a parameter can be found we can usually find a large  number of other unbiased estimators  How do we choose among alternative unbiased  estimators  The criterion of efficiency provides a way to select from among unbiased estimators  of a parameter 
4,626,  Definition of Efficiency  An unbiased estimator is efficient if no other unbiased  estimator of the same parameter has a sampling distribution with smaller variance 
5,626,To explain the definition in repeated samples we expect the estimates from an efficient  estimator to be more tightly grouped around the mean than estimates from other unbiased  estimators  Efficiency is an important property of an estimator   Sample mean    X is an efficient  estimator of the population mean  sample variance s  is an efficient estimator of    
6,626,Recall that a statistic s sampling distribution is defined for a given sample size  Different  sample sizes define different sampling distributions  For example the variance of sampling  distribution of the sample mean is smaller for larger sample sizes  Unbiasedness and efficiency  are properties of an estimator s sampling distribution that hold for any size sample  An unbiased  estimator is unbiased equally in a sample of size    and in a sample of size       In some  problems however we cannot find estimators that have such desirable properties as  unbiasedness in small samples    In this case statisticians may justify the choice of an  estimator based on the properties of the estimator s sampling distribution in extremely large  samples the estimator s so called asymptotic properties  Among such properties the most  important is consistency 
7,626,  Definition of Consistency  A consistent estimator is one for which the probability of  estimates close to the value of the population parameter increases as sample size  increases 
8,626,Somewhat more technically we can define a consistent estimator as an estimator whose  sampling distribution becomes concentrated on the value of the parameter it is intended to  estimate as the sample size approaches infinity  The sample mean in addition to being an  efficient estimator is also a consistent estimator of the population mean  As sample size n goes  to infinity its standard error    n goes to   and its sampling distribution becomes  concentrated right over the value of population mean    To summarize we can think of a  consistent estimator as one that tends to produce more and more accurate estimates of the  population parameter as we increase the sample s size  If an estimator is consistent we may  attempt to increase the accuracy of estimates of a population parameter by calculating estimates  using a larger sample  For an inconsistent estimator however increasing sample size does not  help to increase the probability of accurate estimates

2,627,When we need a single number as an estimate of a population parameter we make use of a  point estimate  However because of sampling error the point estimate is not likely to equal the  population parameter in any given sample  Often a more useful approach than finding a point  estimate is to find a range of values that we expect to bracket the parameter with a specified  level of probability an interval estimate of the parameter  A confidence interval fulfills this  role 
3,627,  Definition of Confidence Interval  A confidence interval is a range for which one can  assert with a given probability       called the degree of confidence that it will  contain the parameter it is intended to estimate  This interval is often referred to as the              confidence interval for the parameter 
4,627,The endpoints of a confidence interval are referred to as the lower and upper confidence limits   In this reading we are concerned only with two sided confidence intervals confidence  intervals for which we calculate both lower and upper limits   
5,627,Confidence intervals are frequently given either a probabilistic interpretation or a practical  interpretation  In the probabilistic interpretation we interpret a    percent confidence interval  for the population mean as follows  In repeated sampling    percent of such confidence  intervals will in the long run include or bracket the population mean  For example suppose we  sample from the population      times and based on each sample we construct a    percent  confidence interval using the calculated sample mean  Because of random chance these  confidence intervals will vary from each other but we expect    percent or     of these  intervals to include the unknown value of the population mean  In practice we generally do not  carry out such repeated sampling  Therefore in the practical interpretation we assert that we are     percent confident that a single    percent confidence interval contains the population mean   We are justified in making this statement because we know that    percent of all possible  confidence intervals constructed in the same manner will contain the population mean  The  confidence intervals that we discuss in this reading have structures similar to the following  basic structure 
6,627,  Construction of Confidence Intervals  A             confidence interval for a  parameter has the following structure

8,627,where
9,627,Point estimate   a point estimate of the parameter  a value of a sample statistic 
10,627,Reliability factor   a number based on the assumed distribution of the point estimate  and the degree of confidence         for the confidence interval
11,627,Standard error   the standard error of the sample statistic providing the point  estimate  
12,627,The most basic confidence interval for the population mean arises when we are sampling from a  normal distribution with known variance  The reliability factor in this case is based on the  standard normal distribution which has a mean of   and a variance of    A standard normal  random variable is conventionally denoted by Z  The notation z  denotes the point of the  standard normal distribution such that   of the probability remains in the right tail  For example       or   percent of the possible values of a standard normal random variable are larger than  z

2,628,Suppose we want to construct a    percent confidence interval for the population mean and for  this purpose we have taken a sample of size     from a normally distributed population with  known variance of           so          We calculate a sample mean of    X       Our point  estimate of the population mean is therefore     If we move      standard deviations above the  mean of a normal distribution       or     percent of the probability remains in the right tail   by symmetry of the normal distribution if we move      standard deviations below the mean        or     percent of the probability remains in the left tail  In total      or   percent of the  probability is in the two tails and      or    percent lies in between  So z             is the  reliability factor for this    percent confidence interval  Note the relationship             for  the confidence interval and the z    for the reliability factor  The standard error of the sample  mean given by Equation   is      X                The confidence interval therefore has a  lower limit of    X            X                                     The upper limit of the  confidence interval is    X            X                                     The    percent  confidence interval for the population mean spans       to

8,628,The reliability factors for the most frequently used confidence intervals are as follows 
9,628,  Reliability Factors for Confidence Intervals Based on the Standard Normal  Distribution  We use the following reliability factors when we construct confidence  intervals based on the standard normal distribution   
10,628,     percent confidence intervals  Use z           
11,628,     percent confidence intervals  Use z            
12,628,     percent confidence intervals  Use z            
13,628,These reliability factors highlight an important fact about all confidence intervals  As we  increase the degree of confidence the confidence interval becomes wider and gives us less  precise information about the quantity we want to estimate   The surer we want to be the less  we have to be sure of    
14,628,In practice the assumption that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is at least  approximately normal is frequently reasonable either because the underlying distribution is  approximately normal or because we have a large sample and the central limit theorem applies   However rarely do we know the population variance in practice  When the population variance  is unknown but the sample mean is at least approximately normally distributed we have two  acceptable ways to calculate the confidence interval for the population mean  We will soon  discuss the more conservative approach which is based on Student s t distribution  the  t distribution for short     In investment literature it is the most frequently used approach in  both estimation and hypothesis tests concerning the mean when the population variance is not  known whether sample size is small or large

2,629,A second approach to confidence intervals for the population mean based on the standard  normal distribution is the z alternative  It can be used only when sample size is large   In  general a sample size of    or larger may be considered large   In contrast to the confidence  interval given in Equation   this confidence interval uses the sample standard deviation s in  computing the standard error of the sample mean  Equation    
3,629,  Confidence Intervals for the Population Mean The z Alternative  Large Sample  Population Variance Unknown   A             confidence interval for population  mean   when sampling from any distribution with unknown variance and when sample  size is large is given by

20,629,The confidence interval spans        to        or      to      carrying two decimal  places  The analyst can say with    percent confidence that the interval includes the  population mean 
21,629,In this example the analyst makes no specific assumption about the probability  distribution describing the population  Rather the analyst relies on the central limit  theorem to produce an approximate normal distribution for the sample mean 
22,629,As Example   shows even if we are unsure of the underlying population distribution we can  still construct confidence intervals for the population mean as long as the sample size is large  because we can apply the central limit theorem

2,630,We now turn to the conservative alternative using the t distribution for constructing  confidence intervals for the population mean when the population variance is not known  For  confidence intervals based on samples from normally distributed populations with unknown  variance the theoretically correct reliability factor is based on the t distribution  Using a  reliability factor based on the t distribution is essential for a small sample size  Using a t reliability factor is appropriate when the population variance is unknown even when we have a  large sample and could use the central limit theorem to justify using a z reliability factor  In this  large sample case the t distribution provides more conservative  wider  confidence intervals 
3,630,The t distribution is a symmetrical probability distribution defined by a single parameter known  as degrees of freedom  df   Each value for the number of degrees of freedom defines one  distribution in this family of distributions  We will shortly compare t distributions with the  standard normal distribution but first we need to understand the concept of degrees of freedom   We can do so by examining the calculation of the sample variance 
4,630,Equation   gives the unbiased estimator of the sample variance that we use  The term in the  denominator n     which is the sample size minus   is the number of degrees of freedom in  estimating the population variance when using Equation    We also use n     as the number of  degrees of freedom for determining reliability factors based on the t distribution  The term   degrees of freedom  is used because in a random sample we assume that observations are  selected independently of each other  The numerator of the sample variance however uses the  sample mean  How does the use of the sample mean affect the number of observations collected  independently for the sample variance formula  With a sample of size    and a mean of     percent for example we can freely select only   observations  Regardless of the   observations  selected we can always find the value for the   th observation that gives a mean equal to     percent  From the standpoint of the sample variance formula then there are   degrees of  freedom  Given that we must first compute the sample mean from the total of n independent  observations only n     observations can be chosen independently for the calculation of the  sample variance  The concept of degrees of freedom comes up frequently in statistics and you  will see it often in later readings 
5,630,Suppose we sample from a normal distribution  The ratio z        X            n  is distributed  normally with a mean of   and standard deviation of    however the ratio  t        X         s  n  follows the t distribution with a mean of   and n     degrees of  freedom  The ratio represented by t is not normal because t is the ratio of two random variables  the sample mean and the sample standard deviation  The definition of the standard normal  random variable involves only one random variable the sample mean  As degrees of freedom  increase however the t distribution approaches the standard normal distribution  Figure   shows the standard normal distribution and two t distributions one with df     and one with df

2,631,Of the three distributions shown in Figure   the standard normal distribution has tails that  approach zero faster than the tails of the two t distributions  The t distribution is also  symmetrically distributed around its mean value of zero just like the normal distribution  As the  degrees of freedom increase the t distribution approaches the standard normal  The  t distribution with df     is closer to the standard normal than the t distribution with df     
3,631,Beyond plus and minus four standard deviations from the mean the area under the standard  normal distribution appears to approach    both t distributions continue to show some area  under each curve beyond four standard deviations however  The t distributions have fatter tails  but the tails of the t distribution with df     more closely resemble the normal distribution s  tails  As the degrees of freedom increase the tails of the t distribution become less fat 
4,631,Frequently referred to values for the t distribution are presented in tables at the end of the book   For each degree of freedom five values are given  t     t     t      t     and t       The values for  t     t     t      t     and t      are such that respectively                      and       of the  probability remains in the right tail for the specified number of degrees of freedom    For  example for df      t             t             t              t             and t              
5,631,We now give the form of confidence intervals for the population mean using the t distribution

9,632,As in Example   an investment analyst seeks to calculate a    percent confidence  interval for the population mean Sharpe ratio of US equity mutual funds based on a  random sample of     US equity mutual funds  The sample mean Sharpe ratio is       and the sample standard deviation of the Sharpe ratios is       Now recognizing that the  population variance of the distribution of Sharpe ratios is unknown the analyst decides  to calculate the confidence interval using the theoretically correct t statistic 
10,632,Because the sample size is     df       In the tables in the back of the book the closest  value is df        Using df       and reading down the      column we find that t              This reliability factor is slightly larger than the reliability factor z            that  was used in Example    The confidence interval will be

6,633,     Selection of Sample Size
7,633,What choices affect the width of a confidence interval  To this point we have discussed two  factors that affect width  the choice of statistic  t or z  and the choice of degree of confidence   affecting which specific value of t or z we use   These two choices determine the reliability  factor   Recall that a confidence interval has the structure Point estimate   Reliability factor    Standard error  
8,633,The choice of sample size also affects the width of a confidence interval  All else equal a larger  sample size decreases the width of a confidence interval  Recall the expression for the standard  error of the sample mean 
9,633,Standard error of the sample mean  
10,633,Sample standard deviation
11,633, Sample size
12,633,We see that the standard error varies inversely with the square root of sample size  As we  increase sample size the standard error decreases and consequently the width of the confidence  interval also decreases  The larger the sample size the greater precision with which we can  estimate the population parameter    All else equal larger samples are good in that sense  In  practice however two considerations may operate against increasing sample size  First as we  saw in Example   concerning the Sharpe ratio increasing the size of a sample may result in  sampling from more than one population  Second increasing sample size may involve  additional expenses that outweigh the value of additional precision  Thus three issues that the  analyst should weigh in selecting sample size are the need for precision the risk of sampling  from more than one population and the expenses of different sample sizes

2,634,A Money Manager Estimates Net Client  Inflows
3,634,A money manager wants to obtain a    percent confidence interval for fund inflows and  outflows over the next six months for his existing clients  He begins by calling a random  sample of    clients and inquiring about their planned additions to and withdrawals  from the fund  The manager then computes the change in cash flow for each client  sampled as a percentage change in total funds placed with the manager  A positive  percentage change indicates a net cash inflow to the client s account and a negative  percentage change indicates a net cash outflow from the client s account  The manager  weights each response by the relative size of the account within the sample and then  computes a weighted average 
4,634,As a result of this process the money manager computes a weighted average of      percent  Thus a point estimate is that the total amount of funds under management will  increase by     percent in the next six months  The standard deviation of the  observations in the sample is    percent  A histogram of past data looks fairly close to  normal so the manager assumes the population is normal 
5,634,   Calculate a    percent confidence interval for the population mean and interpret  your findings 
6,634,The manager decides to see what the confidence interval would look like if he had used  a sample size of    or    and found the same mean      percent  and standard deviation      percent  
7,634,   Using the sample mean of     percent and standard deviation of    percent  compute the confidence interval for sample sizes of    and     For the sample  size of    use Equation

10,634,Because the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small the manager  must use the t statistic in Equation   to calculate the confidence interval  Based on the  sample size of    df   n                   For a    percent confidence interval he needs  to use the value of t      for df      According to the tables in Appendix B at the end of  this volume this value is        Therefore a    percent confidence interval for the  population mean is

17,634,The confidence interval for the population mean spans       percent to         percent    The manager can be confident at the    percent level that this range includes  the population mean

24,635,Having covered many of the fundamental concepts of sampling and estimation we are in a  good position to focus on sampling issues of special concern to analysts  The quality of  inferences depends on the quality of the data as well as on the quality of the sampling plan used   Financial data pose special problems and sampling plans frequently reflect one or more biases   The next section of this reading discusses these issues

2,636,   MORE ON SAMPLING
3,636,We have already seen that the selection of sample period length may raise the issue of sampling  from more than one population  There are in fact a range of challenges to valid sampling that  arise in working with financial data  In this section we discuss four such sampling related  issues  data mining bias sample selection bias look ahead bias and time period bias  All of  these issues are important for point and interval estimation and hypothesis testing  As we will  see if the sample is biased in any way then point and interval estimates and any other  conclusions that we draw from the sample will be in error 
4,636,     Data Mining Bias
5,636,Data mining relates to overuse of the same or related data in ways that we shall describe  shortly  Data mining bias refers to the errors that arise from such misuse of data  Investment  strategies that reflect data mining biases are often not successful in the future  Nevertheless  both investment practitioners and researchers have frequently engaged in data mining  Analysts  thus need to understand and guard against this problem 
6,636,Data mining is the practice of determining a model by extensive searching through a dataset for  statistically significant patterns  that is repeatedly  drilling  in the same data until finding  something that appears to work     In exercises involving statistical significance we set a  significance level which is the probability of rejecting the hypothesis we are testing when the  hypothesis is in fact correct    Because rejecting a true hypothesis is undesirable the  investigator often sets the significance level at a relatively small number such as      or    percent    Suppose we test the hypothesis that a variable does not predict stock returns and we  test in turn     different variables  Let us also suppose that in truth none of the     variables  has the ability to predict stock returns  Using a   percent significance level in our tests we  would still expect that   out of     variables would appear to be significant predictors of stock  returns because of random chance alone  We have mined the data to find some apparently  significant variables  In essence we have explored the same data again and again until we  found some after the fact pattern or patterns in the dataset  This is the sense in which data  mining involves overuse of data  If we were to just report the significant variables without also  reporting the total number of variables that we tested that were unsuccessful as predictors we  would be presenting a very misleading picture of our findings  Our results would appear to be  far more significant than they actually were because a series of tests such as the one just  described invalidates the conventional interpretation of a given significance level  such as    percent  according to the theory of inference

2,637,How can we investigate the presence of data mining bias  With most financial data the most  ready means is to conduct out of sample tests of the proposed variable or strategy  An out of  sample test uses a sample that does not overlap the time period s  of the sample s  on which a  variable strategy or model was developed  If a variable or investment strategy is the result of  data mining it should generally not be significant in out of sample tests  A variable or  investment strategy that is statistically and economically significant in out of sample tests and  that has a plausible economic basis may be the basis for a valid investment strategy  Caution is  still warranted however  The most crucial out of sample test is future investment success  If the  strategy becomes known to other investors prices may adjust so that the strategy however well  tested does not work in the future  To summarize the analyst should be aware that many  apparently profitable investment strategies may reflect data mining bias and thus be cautious  about the future applicability of published investment research results 
3,637,Untangling the extent of data mining can be complex  To assess the significance of an  investment strategy we need to know how many unsuccessful strategies were tried not only by  the current investigator but also by previous investigators using the same or related datasets   Much research in practice closely builds on what other investigators have done and so reflects  intergenerational data mining to use the terminology of McQueen and Thorley          Intergenerational data mining involves using information developed by previous researchers  using a dataset to guide current research using the same or a related dataset    Analysts have  accumulated many observations about the peculiarities of many financial datasets and other  analysts may develop models or investment strategies that will tend to be supported within a  dataset based on their familiarity with the prior experience of other analysts  As a consequence  the importance of those new results may be overstated  Research has suggested that the  magnitude of this type of data mining bias may be considerable   
4,637,With the background of the above definitions and explanations we can understand McQueen  and Thorley s        cogent exploration of data mining in the context of the popular Motley  Fool  Foolish Four  investment strategy  The Foolish Four strategy first presented in      was  a version of the Dow Dividend Strategy that was tuned by its developers to exhibit an even  higher arithmetic mean return than the Dow Dividend Strategy over      to         From       to      the Foolish Four portfolio had an average annual return of    percent and the claim  was made in print that the strategy should have similar returns in the future  As McQueen and  Thorley discussed however the Foolish Four strategy was very much subject to data mining  bias including bias from intergenerational data mining as the strategy s developers exploited  observations about the dataset made by earlier workers  McQueen and Thorley highlighted the  data mining issues by taking the Foolish Four portfolio one step further  They mined the data to  create a  Fractured Four  portfolio that earned nearly    percent over      to      beating the  Foolish Four strategy by almost   percentage points  Observing that all of the Foolish Four  stocks did well in even years but not odd years and that the second to lowest priced high  yielding stock was relatively the best performing stock in odd years the strategy of the  Fractured Four portfolio was to hold the Foolish Four stocks with equal weights in even years  and hold only the second to lowest priced stock in odd years  How likely is it that a  performance difference between even and odd years reflected underlying economic forces  rather than a chance pattern of the data over the particular time period  Probably very unlikely   Unless an investment strategy reflected underlying economic forces we would not expect it to  have any value in a forward looking sense  Because the Foolish Four strategy also partook of  data mining the same issues applied to it  McQueen and Thorley found that in an out of sample  test over the         period the Foolish Four strategy had about the same mean return as  buying and holding the DJIA but with higher risk  If the higher taxes and transaction costs of  the Foolish Four strategy were accounted for the comparison would have been even more  unfavorable

2,638,McQueen and Thorley presented two signs that can warn analysts about the potential existence  of data mining 
3,638,  Too much digging too little confidence  The testing of many variables by the researcher is  the  too much digging  warning sign of a data mining problem  Unfortunately many  researchers do not disclose the number of variables examined in developing a model   Although the number of variables examined may not be reported we should look closely  for verbal hints that the researcher searched over many variables  The use of terms such  as  we noticed  or noted  that  or  someone noticed  or noted  that  with respect to a  pattern in a dataset should raise suspicions that the researchers were trying out variables  based on their own or others  observations of the data 
4,638,  No story no future  The absence of an explicit economic rationale for a variable or trading  strategy is the  no story  warning sign of a data mining problem  Without a plausible  economic rationale or story for why a variable should work the variable is unlikely to  have predictive power  In a demonstration exercise using an extensive search of variables  in an international financial database Leinweber        found that butter production in a  particular country remote from the United States explained    percent of the variation in  US stock returns as represented by the S P      Such a pattern with no plausible  economic rationale is highly likely to be a random pattern particular to a specific time  period    What if we do have a plausible economic explanation for a significant variable   McQueen and Thorley caution that a plausible economic rationale is a necessary but not a  sufficient condition for a trading strategy to have value  As we mentioned earlier if the  strategy is publicized market prices may adjust to reflect the new information as traders  seek to exploit it  as a result the strategy may no longer work 
5,638,     Sample Selection Bias
6,638,When researchers look into questions of interest to analysts or portfolio managers they may  exclude certain stocks bonds portfolios or time periods from the analysis for various  reasons perhaps because of data availability  When data availability leads to certain assets  being excluded from the analysis we call the resulting problem sample selection bias  For  example you might sample from a database that tracks only companies currently in existence   Many mutual fund databases for instance provide historical information about only those funds  that currently exist  Databases that report historical balance sheet and income statement  information suffer from the same sort of bias as the mutual fund databases  Funds or companies  that are no longer in business do not appear there  So a study that uses these types of databases  suffers from a type of sample selection bias known as survivorship bias 
7,638,Dimson Marsh and Staunton        raised the issue of survivorship bias in international  indexes 
8,638,An issue that has achieved prominence is the impact of market survival on  estimated long run returns  Markets can experience not only disappointing  performance but also total loss of value through confiscation hyperinflation  nationalization and market failure  By measuring the performance of markets that  survive over long intervals we draw inferences that are conditioned on survival 
9,638,Yet as pointed out by Brown Goetzmann and Ross        and Goetzmann and
10,638,Jorion        one cannot determine in advance which markets will survive and  which will perish   p

2,639,Survivorship bias sometimes appears when we use both stock price and accounting data  For  example many studies in finance have used the ratio of a company s market price to book  equity per share  i e  the price to book ratio P B  and found that P B is inversely related to a  company s returns  see Fama and French             P B is also used to create many popular  value and growth indexes  If the database that we use to collect accounting data excludes failing  companies however a survivorship bias might result  Kothari Shanken and Sloan        investigated just this question and argued that failing stocks would be expected to have low  returns and low P Bs  If we exclude failing stocks then those stocks with low P Bs that are  included will have returns that are higher on average than if all stocks with low P Bs were  included  Kothari Shanken and Sloan suggested that this bias is responsible for the previous  findings of an inverse relationship between average return and P B    The only advice we can  offer at this point is to be aware of any biases potentially inherent in a sample  Clearly sample  selection biases can cloud the results of any study 
3,639,A sample can also be biased because of the removal  or delisting  of a company s stock from an  exchange    For example the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of  Chicago is a major provider of return data used in academic research  When a delisting occurs  CRSP attempts to collect returns for the delisted company but many times it cannot do so  because of the difficulty involved  CRSP must simply list delisted company returns as missing   A study in the Journal of Finance by Shumway and Warther        documented the bias  caused by delisting for CRSP NASDAQ return data  The authors showed that delistings  associated with poor company performance  e g  bankruptcy  are missed more often than  delistings associated with good or neutral company performance  e g  merger or moving to  another exchange   In addition delistings occur more frequently for small companies 
4,639,Sample selection bias occurs even in markets where the quality and consistency of the data are  quite high  Newer asset classes such as hedge funds may present even greater problems of  sample selection bias  Hedge funds are a heterogeneous group of investment vehicles typically  organized so as to be free from regulatory oversight  In general hedge funds are not required to  publicly disclose performance  in contrast to say mutual funds   Hedge funds themselves  decide whether they want to be included in one of the various databases of hedge fund  performance  Hedge funds with poor track records clearly may not wish to make their records  public creating a problem of self selection bias in hedge fund databases  Further as pointed out  by Fung and Hsieh        because only hedge funds with good records will volunteer to enter  a database in general overall past hedge fund industry performance will tend to appear better  than it really is  Furthermore many hedge fund databases drop funds that go out of business  creating survivorship bias in the database  Even if the database does not drop defunct hedge  funds in the attempt to eliminate survivorship bias the problem remains of hedge funds that  stop reporting performance because of poor results   
5,639,     Look Ahead Bias
6,639,A test design is subject to look ahead bias if it uses information that was not available on the  test date  For example tests of trading rules that use stock market returns and accounting  balance sheet data must account for look ahead bias  In such tests a company s book value per  share is commonly used to construct the P B variable  Although the market price of a stock is  available for all market participants at the same point in time fiscal year end book equity per  share might not become publicly available until sometime in the following quarter

2,640,     Time Period Bias
3,640,A test design is subject to time period bias if it is based on a time period that may make the  results time period specific  A short time series is likely to give period specific results that may  not reflect a longer period  A long time series may give a more accurate picture of true  investment performance  its disadvantage lies in the potential for a structural change occurring  during the time frame that would result in two different return distributions  In this situation the  distribution that would reflect conditions before the change differs from the distribution that  would describe conditions after the change 
4,640,EXAMPLE  
5,640,Biases in Investment Research
6,640,An analyst is reviewing the empirical evidence on historical US equity returns  She finds  that value stocks  i e  those with low P Bs  outperformed growth stocks  i e  those with  high P Bs  in some recent time periods  After reviewing the US market the analyst  wonders whether value stocks might be attractive in the United Kingdom  She  investigates the performance of value and growth stocks in the UK market for the     year period extending from January      to December       To conduct this research  the analyst does the following 
7,640,  obtains the current composition of the Financial Times Stock Exchange  FTSE   All Share Index which is a market capitalization weighted index 
8,640,  eliminates the few companies that do not have December fiscal year ends 
9,640,  uses year end book values and market prices to rank the remaining universe of  companies by P Bs at the end of the year 
10,640,  based on these rankings divides the universe into    portfolios each of which  contains an equal number of stocks 
11,640,  calculates the equal weighted return of each portfolio and the return for the FTSE  All Share Index for the    months following the date each ranking was made  and
12,640,  subtracts the FTSE returns from each portfolio s returns to derive excess returns  for each portfolio 
13,640,Describe and discuss each of the following biases introduced by the analyst s research  design

15,640,  look ahead bias  and

2,641,Survivorship Bias 
3,641,A test design is subject to survivorship bias if it fails to account for companies that have  gone bankrupt merged or otherwise departed the database  In this example the analyst  used the current list of FTSE stocks rather than the actual list of stocks that existed at the  start of each year  To the extent that the computation of returns excluded companies  removed from the index the performance of the portfolios with the lowest P B is subject  to survivorship bias and may be overstated  At some time during the testing period  those companies not currently in existence were eliminated from testing  They would  probably have had low prices  and low P Bs  and poor returns 
4,641,Look Ahead Bias 
5,641,A test design is subject to look ahead bias if it uses information unavailable on the test  date  In this example the analyst conducted the test under the assumption that the  necessary accounting information was available at the end of the fiscal year  For  example the analyst assumed that book value per share for fiscal      was available on     December       Because this information is not released until several months after  the close of a fiscal year the test may have contained look ahead bias  This bias would  make a strategy based on the information appear successful but it assumes perfect  forecasting ability 
6,641,Time Period Bias 
7,641,A test design is subject to time period bias if it is based on a time period that may make  the results time period specific  Although the test covered a period extending more than     years that period may be too short for testing an anomaly  Ideally an analyst should  test market anomalies over several business cycles to ensure that results are not period  specific  This bias can favor a proposed strategy if the time period chosen was favorable  to the strategy 
8,641,SUMMARY
9,641,In this reading we have presented basic concepts and results in sampling and estimation  We  have also emphasized the challenges faced by analysts in appropriately using and interpreting  financial data  As analysts we should always use a critical eye when evaluating the results from  any study  The quality of the sample is of the utmost importance  If the sample is biased the  conclusions drawn from the sample will be in error 
10,641,  To draw valid inferences from a sample the sample should be random 
11,641,  In simple random sampling each observation has an equal chance of being selected  In  stratified random sampling the population is divided into subpopulations called strata or  cells based on one or more classification criteria  simple random samples are then drawn  from each stratum

2,642,  Stratified random sampling ensures that population subdivisions of interest are  represented in the sample  Stratified random sampling also produces more precise  parameter estimates than simple random sampling 
3,642,  Time series data are a collection of observations at equally spaced intervals of time   Cross sectional data are observations that represent individuals groups geographical  regions or companies at a single point in time 
4,642,  The central limit theorem states that for large sample sizes for any underlying  distribution for a random variable the sampling distribution of the sample mean for that  variable will be approximately normal with mean equal to the population mean for that  random variable and variance equal to the population variance of the variable divided by  sample size 
5,642,  Based on the central limit theorem when the sample size is large we can compute  confidence intervals for the population mean based on the normal distribution regardless  of the distribution of the underlying population  In general a sample size of    or larger  can be considered large 
6,642,  An estimator is a formula for estimating a parameter  An estimate is a particular value  that we calculate from a sample by using an estimator 
7,642,  Because an estimator or statistic is a random variable it is described by some probability  distribution  We refer to the distribution of an estimator as its sampling distribution  The  standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is called the standard  error of the sample mean 
8,642,  The desirable properties of an estimator are unbiasedness  the expected value of the  estimator equals the population parameter  efficiency  the estimator has the smallest  variance  and consistency  the probability of accurate estimates increases as sample size  increases  
9,642,  The two types of estimates of a parameter are point estimates and interval estimates  A  point estimate is a single number that we use to estimate a parameter  An interval  estimate is a range of values that brackets the population parameter with some  probability 
10,642,  A confidence interval is an interval for which we can assert with a given probability        called the degree of confidence that it will contain the parameter it is intended to  estimate  This measure is often referred to as the             confidence interval for the  parameter 
11,642,  A             confidence interval for a parameter has the following structure  Point  estimate   Reliability factor   Standard error where the reliability factor is a number  based on the assumed distribution of the point estimate and the degree of confidence          for the confidence interval and where standard error is the standard error of the sample  statistic providing the point estimate 
12,642,  A             confidence interval for population mean   when sampling from a normal  distribution with known variance    is given by    X   z     where z    is the point of  the standard normal distribution such that     remains in the right tail

2,643,  Student s t distribution is a family of symmetrical distributions defined by a single  parameter degrees of freedom 
3,643,  A random sample of size n is said to have n     degrees of freedom for estimating the  population variance in the sense that there are only n     independent deviations from the  mean on which to base the estimate 
4,643,  The degrees of freedom number for use with the t distribution is also n     
5,643,  The t distribution has fatter tails than the standard normal distribution but converges to  the standard normal distribution as degrees of freedom go to infinity 
6,643,  A             confidence interval for the population mean   when sampling from a  normal distribution with unknown variance  a t distribution confidence interval  is given  by    X   t     s  n  where t    is the point of the t distribution such that     remains in  the right tail and s is the sample standard deviation  This confidence interval can also be  used because of the central limit theorem when dealing with a large sample from a  population with unknown variance that may not be normal 
7,643,  We may use the confidence interval    X   z     s  n  as an alternative to the  t distribution confidence interval for the population mean when using a large sample from  a population with unknown variance  The confidence interval based on the z statistic is  less conservative  narrower  than the corresponding confidence interval based on a  t distribution 
8,643,  Three issues in the selection of sample size are the need for precision the risk of  sampling from more than one population and the expenses of different sample sizes 
9,643,  Sample data in investments can have a variety of problems  Survivorship bias occurs if  companies are excluded from the analysis because they have gone out of business or  because of reasons related to poor performance  Data mining bias comes from finding  models by repeatedly searching through databases for patterns  Look ahead bias exists if  the model uses data not available to market participants at the time the market  participants act in the model  Finally time period bias is present if the time period used  makes the results time period specific or if the time period used includes a point of  structural change

2,651,    Refer to Figure   to help visualize the answer to this question   Basically only one  standard normal distribution exists but many t distributions exist one for every  different number of degrees of freedom  The normal distribution and the t distribution for  a large number of degrees of freedom are practically the same  The lower the degrees of  freedom the flatter the t distribution becomes  The t distribution has less mass  lower  probabilities  in the center of the distribution and more mass  higher probabilities  out in  both tails  Therefore the confidence intervals based on t values will be wider than those  based on the normal distribution  Stated differently the probability of being within a  given number of standard deviations  such as within    standard deviation or    standard  deviations  is lower for the t distribution than for the normal distribution

2,653,The confidence interval for the population mean is centered at the sample mean    X   The  population standard deviation is   and the sample size is n  The population standard  deviation divided by the square root of n is the standard error of the estimate of the mean   The value of z depends on the desired degree of confidence  For a    percent confidence  interval z             and the confidence interval estimate is

6,653,If the population variance is not known we make two changes to the technique used  when the population variance is known  First we must use the sample standard deviation  instead of the population standard deviation  Second we use the t distribution instead of  the normal distribution  The critical t value will depend on degrees of freedom n      If  the sample size is large we have the alternative of using the z distribution with the  sample standard deviation 
7,653,   
8,653,A  The probabilities can be taken from a normal table in which the critical z values  are      or      and we are including the probabilities in both tails  The  probabilities that the exchange rate will be at least   or   standard deviations away  from the mean are

12,653,The probability of the rate being outside   or   standard deviations of the mean is much  smaller with a known normal distribution than when the distribution is unknown and we  are relying on Chebyshev s inequality 
13,653,    No  First the conclusion on the limit of zero is wrong  second the support cited for  drawing the conclusion  i e  the central limit theorem  is not relevant in this context 
14,653,    In many instances the distribution that describes the underlying population is not normal  or the distribution is not known  The central limit theorem states that if the sample size is  large regardless of the shape of the underlying population the distribution of the sample  mean is approximately normal  Therefore even in these instances we can still construct  confidence intervals  and conduct tests of inference  as long as the sample size is large   generally n       
15,653,    The statement makes the following mistakes 
16,653,  Given the conditions in the statement the distribution of    X will be approximately  normal only for large sample sizes

2,654,  The statement omits the important element of the central limit theorem that the  distribution of    X will have mean   
3,654,    A is correct  The discrepancy arises from sampling error  Sampling error exists whenever  one fails to observe every element of the population because a sample statistic can vary  from sample to sample  As stated in the reading the sample mean is an unbiased  estimator a consistent estimator and an efficient estimator of the population mean   Although the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean the  expected value of the sample mean equals the population mean because of sampling  error we do not expect the sample mean to exactly equal the population mean in any one  sample we may take 
4,654,    No we cannot say that Alcorn Mutual Funds as a group is superior to competitors   Alcorn Mutual Funds  advertisement may easily mislead readers because the  advertisement does not show the performance of all its funds  In particular Alcorn  Mutual Funds is engaging in sample selection bias by presenting the investment results  from its best performing funds only 
5,654,    Spence may be guilty of data mining  He has used so many possible combinations of  variables on so many stocks it is not surprising that he found some instances in which a  model worked  In fact it would have been more surprising if he had not found any  To  decide whether to use his model you should do two things  First ask that the model be  tested on out of sample data that is data that were not used in building the model  The  model may not be successful with out of sample data  Second examine his model to  make sure that the relationships in the model make economic sense have a story and  have a future 
6,654,    C is correct  Stratified random sampling involves dividing a population into  subpopulations based on one or more classification criteria  Then simple random samples  are drawn from each subpopulation in sizes proportional to the relative size of each  subpopulation  These samples are then pooled to form a stratified random sample 
7,654,    B is correct  Given a population described by any probability distribution  normal or non  normal  with finite variance the central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution  of the sample mean will be approximately normal with the mean approximately equal to  the population mean when the sample size is large

2,655,    B is correct  An unbiased estimator is one for which the expected value equals the  parameter it is intended to estimate 
3,655,    A is correct  A consistent estimator is one for which the probability of estimates close to  the value of the population parameter increases as sample size increases  More  specifically a consistent estimator s sampling distribution becomes concentrated on the  value of the parameter it is intended to estimate as the sample size approaches infinity 
4,655,    A is correct  As the degree of confidence increases  e g  from     to      a given  confidence interval will become wider  A confidence interval is a range for which one  can assert with a given probability       called the degree of confidence that it will  contain the parameter it is intended to estimate 
5,655,    A is correct  A standard normal distribution has tails that approach zero faster than the  t distribution  As degrees of freedom increase the tails of the t distribution become less  fat and the t distribution begins to look more like a standard normal distribution  But as  degrees of freedom decrease the tails of the t distribution become fatter 
6,655,    B is correct  The confidence interval is calculated using the following equation

10,655,Sample standard deviation  s

14,655,         
15,655,                 
16,655,Therefore the interval spans          to          meaning its width is equal to  approximately          This interval can be alternatively calculated as             
17,655,    A is correct  To solve use the structure of Confidence interval   Point estimate    Reliability factor   Standard error which for a normally distributed population with  known variance is represented by the following formula

26,655,    B is correct  All else being equal as the sample size increases the standard error of the  sample mean decreases and the width of the confidence interval also decreases 
27,655,    B is correct  A report that uses a current list of stocks does not account for firms that  failed merged or otherwise disappeared from the public equity market in previous years   As a consequence the report is biased  This type of bias is known as survivorship bias

2,656,    B is correct  An out of sample test is used to investigate the presence of data mining bias   Such a test uses a sample that does not overlap the time period of the sample on which a  variable strategy or model was developed 
3,656,    A is correct  A short time series is likely to give period specific results that may not  reflect a longer time period 
4,656,NOTES
5,656, When the mean or variance of a time series is not constant through time the time series is not stationary 
6,656, The reader may also encounter two types of datasets that have both time series and cross sectional aspects  Panel  data consist of observations through time on a single characteristic of multiple observational units  For example  the annual inflation rate of the Eurozone countries over a five year period would represent panel data   Longitudinal data consist of observations on characteristic s  of the same observational unit through time   Observations on a set of financial ratios for a single company over a    year period would be an example of  longitudinal data  Both panel and longitudinal data may be represented by arrays  matrixes  in which successive  rows represent the observations for successive time periods 
7,656, Sometimes confusion arises because  sample mean  is also used in another sense  When we calculate the sample  mean for a particular sample we obtain a definite number say    If we state that  the sample mean is    we are  using  sample mean  in the sense of a particular outcome of sample mean as a random variable  The number   is of  course a constant and does not have a probability distribution  In this discussion we are not referring to  sample  mean  in the sense of a constant number related to a particular sample 
8,656, When the underlying population is very nonnormal a sample size well in excess of    may be required for the  normal distribution to be a good description of the sampling distribution of the mean 
9,656, We need to note a technical point  When we take a sample of size n from a finite population of size N we apply a  shrinkage factor to the estimate of the standard error of the sample mean that is called the finite population  correction factor  fpc   The fpc is equal to   N   n   N           Thus if N       and n                                             If we have estimated a standard error of say    according to Equation   or Equation   the new  estimate is                           The fpc applies only when we sample from a finite population without  replacement  most practitioners also do not apply the fpc if sample size n is very small relative to N  say less than    percent of N   For more information on the finite population correction factor see Daniel and Terrell        
10,656, Monte Carlo simulation involves the use of a computer to represent the operation of a system subject to risk  An  integral part of Monte Carlo simulation is the generation of a large number of random samples from a specified  probability distribution or distributions 
11,656, If a is the lower limit of a uniform random variable and b is the upper limit then the random variable s mean is  given by  a   b    and its variance is given by  b   a       The reading on common probability distributions fully  describes continuous uniform random variables 
12,656, See Daniel and Terrell        or Greene        for a thorough treatment of the properties of estimators 
13,656, An efficient estimator is sometimes referred to as the best unbiased estimator 
14,656,  Such problems frequently arise in regression and time series analyses 
15,656,  It is also possible to define two types of one sided confidence intervals for a population parameter  A lower one  sided confidence interval establishes a lower limit only  Associated with such an interval is an assertion that with a  specified degree of confidence the population parameter equals or exceeds the lower limit  An upper one sided  confidence interval establishes an upper limit only  the related assertion is that the population parameter is less than  or equal to that upper limit with a specified degree of confidence  Investment researchers rarely present one sided  confidence intervals however

5,657,  The distribution of the statistic t is called Student s t distribution after the pen name  Student  used by W  S   Gosset who published his work in      
6,657,  The values t     t     t      t     and t      are also referred to as one sided critical values of t at the                       and       significance levels for the specified number of degrees of freedom 
7,657,  A formula exists for determining the sample size needed to obtain a desired width for a confidence interval   Define E   Reliability factor   Standard error  The smaller E is the smaller the width of the confidence interval  because  E is the confidence interval s width  The sample size to obtain a desired value of E at a given degree of  confidence         is n     t   s  E   
8,657,  We assumed in this example that sample size is sufficiently small compared with the size of the client base that  we can disregard the finite population correction factor  mentioned in Footnote    
9,657,  Some researchers use the term  data snooping  instead of data mining 
10,657,  To convey an understanding of data mining it is very helpful to introduce some basic concepts related to  hypothesis testing  The reading on hypothesis testing contains further discussion of significance levels and tests of  significance 
11,657,  In terms of our previous discussion of confidence intervals significance at the   percent level corresponds to a  hypothesized value for a population statistic falling outside a    percent confidence interval based on an  appropriate sample statistic  e g  the sample mean when the hypothesis concerns the population mean  
12,657,  The term  intergenerational  comes from viewing each round of researchers as a generation  Campbell Lo and  MacKinlay        have called intergenerational data mining  data snooping   The latter phrase however is  commonly used as a synonym of data mining  thus McQueen and Thorley s terminology is less ambiguous  The  term  intragenerational data mining  is available when we want to highlight that the reference is to an  investigator s new or independent data mining 
13,657,  For example Lo and MacKinlay        concluded that the magnitude of this type of bias on tests of the capital  asset pricing model was considerable 
14,657,  The Dow Dividend Strategy also known as Dogs of the Dow Strategy consists of holding an equally weighted  portfolio of the    highest yielding DJIA stocks as of the beginning of a year  At the time of McQueen and  Thorley s research the Foolish Four strategy was as follows  At the beginning of each year the Foolish Four  portfolio purchases a   stock portfolio from the   lowest priced stocks of the    highest yielding DJIA stocks  The  lowest priced stock of the five is excluded and    percent is invested in the second to lowest priced stock with     percent weights in the remaining three 
15,657,  In the finance literature such a random but irrelevant to the future pattern is sometimes called an artifact of the  dataset 
16,657,  See Fama and French       p      for discussion of data snooping and survivorship bias in their tests

4,660,   INTRODUCTION
5,660,Analysts often confront competing ideas about how financial markets work  Some of these  ideas develop through personal research or experience with markets  others come from  interactions with colleagues  and many others appear in the professional literature on finance  and investments  In general how can an analyst decide whether statements about the financial  world are probably true or probably false 
6,660,When we can reduce an idea or assertion to a definite statement about the value of a quantity  such as an underlying or population mean the idea becomes a statistically testable statement or  hypothesis  The analyst may want to explore questions such as the following 
7,660,  Is the underlying mean return on this mutual fund different from the underlying mean  return on its benchmark 
8,660,  Did the volatility of returns on this stock change after the stock was added to a stock  market index 
9,660,  Are a security s bid ask spreads related to the number of dealers making a market in the  security 
10,660,  Do data from a national bond market support a prediction of an economic theory about  the term structure of interest rates  the relationship between yield and maturity  
11,660,To address these questions we use the concepts and tools of hypothesis testing  Hypothesis  testing is part of statistical inference the process of making judgments about a larger group  a  population  on the basis of a smaller group actually observed  a sample   The concepts and tools  of hypothesis testing provide an objective means to gauge whether the available evidence  supports the hypothesis  After a statistical test of a hypothesis we should have a clearer idea of  the probability that a hypothesis is true or not although our conclusion always stops short of  certainty  Hypothesis testing has been a powerful tool in the advancement of investment  knowledge and science  As Robert L  Kahn of the Institute for Social Research  Ann Arbor  Michigan  has written  The mill of science grinds only when hypothesis and data are in  continuous and abrasive contact

2,661,The main emphases of this reading are the framework of hypothesis testing and tests concerning  mean and variance two quantities frequently used in investments  We give an overview of the  procedure of hypothesis testing in the next section  We then address testing hypotheses about  the mean and hypotheses about the differences between means  In the fourth section of this  reading we address testing hypotheses about a single variance and hypotheses about the  differences between variances  We end the reading with an overview of some other important  issues and techniques in statistical inference 
3,661,   HYPOTHESIS TESTING
4,661,Hypothesis testing as we have mentioned is part of the branch of statistics known as statistical  inference  Traditionally the field of statistical inference has two subdivisions  estimation and  hypothesis testing  Estimation addresses the question  What is this parameter s  e g  the  population mean s  value   The answer is in the form of a confidence interval built around a  point estimate  Take the case of the mean  We build a confidence interval for the population  mean around the sample mean as a point estimate  For the sake of specificity suppose the  sample mean is    and a    percent confidence interval for the population mean is          the  confidence interval runs from    to      If this confidence interval has been properly  constructed there is a    percent probability that the interval from    to    contains the  population mean s value   The second branch of statistical inference hypothesis testing has a  somewhat different focus  A hypothesis testing question is  Is the value of the parameter  say  the population mean      or some other specific value    The assertion  the population mean is      is a hypothesis  A hypothesis is defined as a statement about one or more populations 
5,661,This section focuses on the concepts of hypothesis testing  The process of hypothesis testing is  part of a rigorous approach to acquiring knowledge known as the scientific method  The  scientific method starts with observation and the formulation of a theory to organize and explain  observations  We judge the correctness of the theory by its ability to make accurate  predictions for example to predict the results of new observations   If the predictions are  correct we continue to maintain the theory as a possibly correct explanation of our  observations  When risk plays a role in the outcomes of observations as in finance we can only  try to make unbiased probability based judgments about whether the new data support the  predictions  Statistical hypothesis testing fills that key role of testing hypotheses when chance  plays a role  In an analyst s day to day work he may address questions to which he might give  answers of varying quality  When an analyst correctly formulates the question into a testable  hypothesis and carries out and reports on a hypothesis test he has provided an element of  support to his answer consistent with the standards of the scientific method  Of course the  analyst s logic economic reasoning information sources and perhaps other factors also play a  role in our assessment of the answer s quality  
6,661,We organize this introduction to hypothesis testing around the following list of seven steps 
7,661,  Steps in Hypothesis Testing  The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows  
8,661,   Stating the hypotheses 
9,661,   Identifying the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution

2,662,   Specifying the significance level 
3,662,   Stating the decision rule 
4,662,   Collecting the data and calculating the test statistic 
5,662,   Making the statistical decision 
6,662,   Making the economic or investment decision 
7,662,We will explain each of these steps using as illustration a hypothesis test concerning the sign of  the risk premium on Canadian stocks  The steps above constitute a traditional approach to  hypothesis testing  We will end the section with a frequently used alternative to those steps the  p value approach 
8,662,The first step in hypothesis testing is stating the hypotheses  We always state two hypotheses   the null hypothesis  or null  designated H  and the alternative hypothesis designated Ha 
9,662,  Definition of Null Hypothesis  The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested  For  example we could hypothesize that the population mean risk premium for Canadian  equities is less than or equal to zero 
10,662,The null hypothesis is a proposition that is considered true unless the sample we use to conduct  the hypothesis test gives convincing evidence that the null hypothesis is false  When such  evidence is present we are led to the alternative hypothesis 
11,662,  Definition of Alternative Hypothesis  The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis  accepted when the null hypothesis is rejected  Our alternative hypothesis is that the  population mean risk premium for Canadian equities is greater than zero 
12,662,Suppose our question concerns the value of a population parameter   in relation to one  possible value of the parameter     these are read respectively  theta  and  theta sub zero     Examples of a population parameter include the population mean   and the population  variance     We can formulate three different sets of hypotheses which we label according to  the assertion made by the alternative hypothesis 
13,662,  Formulations of Hypotheses  We can formulate the null and alternative hypotheses in  three different ways 
14,662,   H          versus Ha          a  not equal to  alternative hypothesis 
15,662,   H          versus Ha          a  greater than  alternative hypothesis 
16,662,   H          versus Ha          a  less than  alternative hypothesis 
17,662,In our Canadian example      RP and represents the population mean risk premium on  Canadian equities  Also        and we are using the second of the above three formulations 
18,662,The first formulation is a two sided hypothesis test  or two tailed hypothesis test   We
19,662,reject the null in favor of the alternative if the evidence indicates that the population parameter  is either smaller or larger than     In contrast Formulations   and   are each a one sided  hypothesis test  or one tailed hypothesis test   For Formulations   and   we reject the  null only if the evidence indicates that the population parameter is respectively greater than or  less than     The alternative hypothesis has one side

2,663,Notice that in each case above we state the null and alternative hypotheses such that they  account for all possible values of the parameter  With Formulation   for example the  parameter is either equal to the hypothesized value     under the null hypothesis  or not equal to  the hypothesized value     under the alternative hypothesis   Those two statements logically  exhaust all possible values of the parameter 
3,663,Despite the different ways to formulate hypotheses we always conduct a test of the null  hypothesis at the point of equality         Whether the null is H          H          or H           we actually test         The reasoning is straightforward  Suppose the hypothesized value of  the parameter is    Consider H         with a  greater than  alternative hypothesis Ha         If  we have enough evidence to reject H         in favor of Ha        we definitely also have  enough evidence to reject the hypothesis that the parameter   is some smaller value such as      or    To review the calculation to test the null hypothesis is the same for all three  formulations  What is different for the three formulations we will see shortly is how the  calculation is evaluated to decide whether or not to reject the null 
4,663,How do we choose the null and alternative hypotheses  Probably most common are  not equal  to  alternative hypotheses  We reject the null because the evidence indicates that the parameter  is either larger or smaller than     Sometimes however we may have a  suspected  or  hoped  for  condition for which we want to find supportive evidence   In that case we can formulate  the alternative hypothesis as the statement that this condition is true  the null hypothesis that we  test is the statement that this condition is not true  If the evidence supports rejecting the null and  accepting the alternative we have statistically confirmed what we thought was true  For  example economic theory suggests that investors require a positive risk premium on stocks  the  risk premium is defined as the expected return on stocks minus the risk free rate   Following  the principle of stating the alternative as the  hoped for  condition we formulate the following  hypotheses 
5,663,H   The population mean risk premium on Canadian stocks is less than or equal to     Ha  The population mean risk premium on Canadian stocks is positive 
6,663,Note that  greater than  and  less than  alternative hypotheses reflect the beliefs of the  researcher more strongly than a  not equal to  alternative hypothesis  To emphasize an attitude  of neutrality the researcher may sometimes select a  not equal to  alternative hypothesis when  a one sided alternative hypothesis is also reasonable 
7,663,The second step in hypothesis testing is identifying the appropriate test statistic and its  probability distribution 
8,663,  Definition of Test Statistic  A test statistic is a quantity calculated based on a sample  whose value is the basis for deciding whether or not to reject the null hypothesis 
9,663,The focal point of our statistical decision is the value of the test statistic  Frequently  in all the  cases that we examine in this reading  the test statistic has the form
10,663,Equation    
11,663,Test statistic
12,663,  Sample statistic Value of the population parameter under H  Standard error of the sample statistic

2,664,For our risk premium example the population parameter of interest is the population mean risk  premium  RP  We label the hypothesized value of the population mean under H  as      Restating the hypotheses using symbols we test H    RP      versus Ha   RP       However  because under the null we are testing        we write H    RP     versus Ha   RP     
3,664,The sample mean provides an estimate of the population mean  Therefore we can use the  sample mean risk premium calculated from historical data    X RP  as the sample statistic in  Equation    The standard deviation of the sample statistic known as the  standard error  of the  statistic is the denominator in Equation    For this example the sample statistic is a sample  mean  For a sample mean    X  calculated from a sample generated by a population with standard  deviation   the standard error is given by one of two expressions 
4,664,Equation    
5,664,     X

9,664,Equation    
10,664,s    X  
11,664,s
12,664, n
13,664,when we do not know the population standard deviation and need to use the sample standard  deviation s to estimate it  For this example because we do not know the population standard  deviation of the process generating the return we use Equation    The test statistic is thus
14,664,   X RP     
15,664,s    X
16,664, 
17,664,   X RP     s  n
18,664,In making the substitution of   for    we use the fact already highlighted that we test any null  hypothesis at the point of equality as well as the fact that        here 
19,664,We have identified a test statistic to test the null hypothesis  What probability distribution does  it follow  We will encounter four distributions for test statistics in this reading 
20,664,  the t distribution  for a t test  
21,664,  the standard normal or z distribution  for a z test  
22,664,  the chi square      distribution  for a chi square test   and
23,664,  the F distribution  for an F test  
24,664,We will discuss the details later but assume we can conduct a z test based on the central limit  theorem because our Canadian sample has many observations   To summarize the test statistic  for the hypothesis test concerning the mean risk premium is    X RP s    X   We can conduct a z test  because we can plausibly assume that the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution

2,665,The third step in hypothesis testing is specifying the significance level  When the test statistic  has been calculated two actions are possible     We reject the null hypothesis or    we do not  reject the null hypothesis  The action we take is based on comparing the calculated test statistic  to a specified possible value or values  The comparison values we choose are based on the level  of significance selected  The level of significance reflects how much sample evidence we  require to reject the null  Analogous to its counterpart in a court of law the required standard of  proof can change according to the nature of the hypotheses and the seriousness of the  consequences of making a mistake  There are four possible outcomes when we test a null  hypothesis 
3,665,   We reject a false null hypothesis  This is a correct decision 
4,665,   We reject a true null hypothesis  This is called a Type I error 
5,665,   We do not reject a false null hypothesis  This is called a Type II error 
6,665,   We do not reject a true null hypothesis  This is a correct decision 
7,665,We illustrate these outcomes in Table   
8,665,Table    Type I and Type II Errors in Hypothesis Testing
9,665,Decision
10,665,Do not reject H  Reject H   accept Ha 
11,665,True Situation H  True H  False Correct Decision Type II Error Type I Error Correct Decision
12,665,When we make a decision in a hypothesis test we run the risk of making either a Type I or a  Type II error  These are mutually exclusive errors  If we mistakenly reject the null we can only  be making a Type I error  if we mistakenly fail to reject the null we can only be making a Type  II error 
13,665,The probability of a Type I error in testing a hypothesis is denoted by the Greek letter alpha     This probability is also known as the level of significance of the test  For example a level of  significance of      for a test means that there is a   percent probability of rejecting a true null  hypothesis  The probability of a Type II error is denoted by the Greek letter beta   
14,665,Controlling the probabilities of the two types of errors involves a trade off  All else equal if we  decrease the probability of a Type I error by specifying a smaller significance level  say       rather than       we increase the probability of making a Type II error because we will reject  the null less frequently including when it is false  The only way to reduce the probabilities of  both types of errors simultaneously is to increase the sample size n

2,666,Quantifying the trade off between the two types of error in practice is usually impossible  because the probability of a Type II error is itself hard to quantify  Consider H         versus  Ha         Because every true value of   greater than   makes the null hypothesis false each  value of   greater than   has a different    Type II error probability   In contrast it is sufficient  to state a Type I error probability for       the point at which we conduct the test of the null  hypothesis  Thus in general we specify only   the probability of a Type I error when we  conduct a hypothesis test  Whereas the significance level of a test is the probability of  incorrectly rejecting the null the power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the  null that is the probability of rejecting the null when it is false   When more than one test  statistic is available to conduct a hypothesis test we should prefer the most powerful all else  equal  
3,666,To summarize the standard approach to hypothesis testing involves specifying a level of  significance  probability of Type I error  only  It is most appropriate to specify this significance  level prior to calculating the test statistic  If we specify it after calculating the test statistic we  may be influenced by the result of the calculation which detracts from the objectivity of the  test 
4,666,We can use three conventional significance levels to conduct hypothesis tests            and        Qualitatively if we can reject a null hypothesis at the      level of significance we have  some evidence that the null hypothesis is false  If we can reject a null hypothesis at the       level we have strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false  And if we can reject a null  hypothesis at the      level we have very strong evidence that the null hypothesis is false  For  the risk premium example we will specify a      significance level 
5,666,The fourth step in hypothesis testing is stating the decision rule  The general principle is simply  stated  When we test the null hypothesis if we find that the calculated value of the test statistic  is more extreme than a given value or values determined by the specified level of significance    we reject the null hypothesis  We say the result is statistically significant  Otherwise we  do not reject the null hypothesis and we say the result is not statistically significant  The value  or values with which we compare the calculated test statistic to make our decision are the  rejection points  critical values  for the test   
6,666,  Definition of a Rejection Point  Critical Value  for the Test Statistic  A rejection point   critical value  for a test statistic is a value with which the computed test statistic is  compared to decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis 
7,666,For a one tailed test we indicate a rejection point using the symbol for the test statistic with a  subscript indicating the specified probability of a Type I error    for example z   For a two  tailed test we indicate z     To illustrate the use of rejection points suppose we are using a z test  and have chosen a      level of significance 
8,666,  For a test of H          versus Ha         two rejection points exist one negative and one  positive  For a two sided test at the      level the total probability of a Type I error must  sum to       Thus                of the probability should be in each tail of the  distribution of the test statistic under the null  Consequently the two rejection points are  z             and  z               Let z represent the calculated value of the test statistic   We reject the null if we find that z         or z         We do not reject if         z

2,667,  For a test of H          versus Ha         at the      level of significance the rejection  point is z              We reject the null hypothesis if z          The value of the standard  normal distribution such that   percent of the outcomes lie to the right is z             
3,667,  For a test of H          versus Ha         the rejection point is  z               We reject  the null hypothesis if z          
4,667,Figure   illustrates a test H          versus Ha         at the      significance level using a  z test  The  acceptance region  is the traditional name for the set of values of the test statistic  for which we do not reject the null hypothesis   The traditional name however is inaccurate   We should avoid using phrases such as  accept the null hypothesis  because such a statement  implies a greater degree of conviction about the null than is warranted when we fail to reject it      On either side of the acceptance region is a rejection region  or critical region   If the null  hypothesis that        is true the test statistic has a     percent chance of falling in the left  rejection region and a     percent chance of falling in the right rejection region  Any calculated  value of the test statistic that falls in either of these two regions causes us to reject the null  hypothesis at the      significance level  The rejection points of      and       are seen to be  the dividing lines between the acceptance and rejection regions

6,667,Figure   affords a good opportunity to highlight the relationship between confidence intervals  and hypothesis tests  A    percent confidence interval for the population mean   based on  sample mean    X  is given by    X        s    X to    X        s    X  where s    X is the standard error of  the sample mean  Equation

3,668,s    X
4,668,       
5,668,Here    is the hypothesized value of the population mean  The condition states that rejection is  warranted if the test statistic exceeds       Multiplying both sides by s    X  we have     X             s    X  or after rearranging    X        s    X       which we can also write as          X        s    X   This expression says that if the hypothesized population mean    is less  than the lower limit of the    percent confidence interval based on the sample mean we must  reject the null hypothesis at the   percent significance level  the test statistic falls in the  rejection region to the right  
6,668,Now we can take the other condition for rejecting the null hypothesis 
7,668,   X     
8,668,s    X
9,668,        
10,668,and using algebra as before rewrite it as         X        s    X   If the hypothesized population  mean is larger than the upper limit of the    percent confidence interval we reject the null  hypothesis at the   percent level  the test statistic falls in the rejection region to the left   Thus  an   significance level in a two sided hypothesis test can be interpreted in exactly the same way  as a         confidence interval 
11,668,In summary when the hypothesized value of the population parameter under the null is outside  the corresponding confidence interval the null hypothesis is rejected  We could use confidence  intervals to test hypotheses  practitioners however usually do not  Computing a test statistic   one number versus two numbers for the usual confidence interval  is more efficient  Also  analysts encounter actual cases of one sided confidence intervals only rarely  Furthermore only  when we compute a test statistic can we obtain a p value a useful quantity relating to the  significance of our results  we will discuss p values shortly  
12,668,To return to our risk premium test we stated hypotheses H    RP     versus Ha   RP      We  identified the test statistic as    X RP  s    X and stated that it follows a standard normal distribution   We are therefore conducting a one sided z test  We specified a      significance level  For this  one sided z test the rejection point at the      level of significance is        We will reject the  null if the calculated z statistic is larger than        Figure   illustrates this test

3,669,The fifth step in hypothesis testing is collecting the data and calculating the test statistic  The  quality of our conclusions depends not only on the appropriateness of the statistical model but  also on the quality of the data we use in conducting the test  We first need to check for  measurement errors in the recorded data  Some other issues to be aware of include sample  selection bias and time period bias  Sample selection bias refers to bias introduced by  systematically excluding some members of the population according to a particular attribute   One type of sample selection bias is survivorship bias  For example if we define our sample as  US bond mutual funds currently operating and we collect returns for just these funds we will  systematically exclude funds that have not survived to the present date  Nonsurviving funds are  likely to have underperformed surviving funds on average  as a result the performance reflected  in the sample may be biased upward  Time period bias refers to the possibility that when we use  a time series sample our statistical conclusion may be sensitive to the starting and ending dates  of the sample   
4,669,To continue with the risk premium hypothesis we focus on Canadian equities  According to  Dimson Marsh and Staunton        for the period      to      inclusive      annual  observations  the arithmetic mean equity risk premium for Canadian stocks relative to bond  returns    X RP  was     percent per year  The sample standard deviation of the annual risk  premiums was      percent  Using Equation   the standard error of the sample mean is  s    X   s  n                        The test statistic is z      X RP s    X                       
5,669,The sixth step in hypothesis testing is making the statistical decision  For our example because  the test statistic z        is larger than the rejection point of       we reject the null hypothesis  in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the risk premium on Canadian stocks is positive  The  first six steps are the statistical steps  The final decision concerns our use of the statistical  decision

2,670,The seventh and final step in hypothesis testing is making the economic or investment decision  The economic or investment decision takes into consideration not only the statistical decision  but also all pertinent economic issues  In the sixth step we found strong statistical evidence that  the Canadian risk premium is positive  The magnitude of the estimated risk premium      percent a year is economically very meaningful as well  Based on these considerations an  investor might decide to commit funds to Canadian equities  A range of nonstatistical  considerations such as the investor s tolerance for risk and financial position might also enter  the decision making process 
3,670,The preceding discussion raises an issue that often arises in this decision making step  We  frequently find that slight differences between a variable and its hypothesized value are  statistically significant but not economically meaningful  For example we may be testing an  investment strategy and reject a null hypothesis that the mean return to the strategy is zero  based on a large sample  Equation   shows that the smaller the standard error of the sample  statistic  the divisor in the formula  the larger the value of the test statistic and the greater the  chance the null will be rejected all else equal  The standard error decreases as the sample size  n increases so that for very large samples we can reject the null for small departures from it   We may find that although a strategy provides a statistically significant positive mean return  the results are not economically significant when we account for transaction costs taxes and  risk  Even if we conclude that a strategy s results are economically meaningful we should  explore the logic of why the strategy might work in the future before actually implementing it   Such considerations cannot be incorporated into a hypothesis test 
4,670,Before leaving the subject of the process of hypothesis testing we should discuss an important  alternative approach called the p value approach to hypothesis testing  Analysts and researchers  often report the p value  also called the marginal significance level  associated with hypothesis  tests 
5,670,  Definition of p Value  The p value is the smallest level of significance at which the null  hypothesis can be rejected 
6,670,For the value of the test statistic of      in the risk premium hypothesis test using a spreadsheet  function for the standard normal distribution we calculate a p value of          We can reject  the null hypothesis at that level of significance  The smaller the p value the stronger the  evidence against the null hypothesis and in favor of the alternative hypothesis  The p value for a  two sided test that a parameter equals zero is frequently generated automatically by statistical  and econometric software programs   
7,670,We can use p values in the hypothesis testing framework presented above as an alternative to  using rejection points  If the p value is less than our specified level of significance we reject the  null hypothesis  Otherwise we do not reject the null hypothesis  Using the p value in this  fashion we reach the same conclusion as we do using rejection points  For example because          is less than      we would reject the null hypothesis in the risk premium test  The  p value however provides more precise information on the strength of the evidence than does  the rejection points approach  The p value of         indicates that the null is rejected at a far  smaller level of significance than      
8,670,If one researcher examines a question using a      significance level and another researcher  uses a      significance level the reader may have trouble comparing the findings  This  concern has given rise to an approach to presenting the results of hypothesis tests that features  p values and omits specification of the significance level  Step     The interpretation of the  statistical results is left to the consumer of the research  This has sometimes been called the  p value approach to hypothesis testing

2,671,   HYPOTHESIS TESTS CONCERNING THE  MEAN
3,671,Hypothesis tests concerning the mean are among the most common in practice  In this section  we discuss such tests for several distinct types of problems  In one type  discussed in Section       we test whether the population mean of a single population is equal to  or greater or less  than  some hypothesized value  Then in Sections     and     we address inference on means  based on two samples  Is an observed difference between two sample means due to chance or  different underlying  population  means  When we have two random samples that are  independent of each other no relationship exists between the measurements in one sample and  the measurements in the other the techniques of Section     apply  When the samples are  dependent the methods of Section     are appropriate   
4,671,     Tests Concerning a Single Mean
5,671,An analyst who wants to test a hypothesis concerning the value of an underlying or population  mean will conduct a t test in the great majority of cases  A t test is a hypothesis test using a  statistic  t statistic  that follows a t distribution  The t distribution is a probability distribution  defined by a single parameter known as degrees of freedom  df   Each value of degrees of  freedom defines one distribution in this family of distributions  The t distribution is closely  related to the standard normal distribution  Like the standard normal distribution a  t distribution is symmetrical with a mean of zero  However the t distribution is more spread  out  It has a standard deviation greater than    compared to   for the standard normal    and  more probability for outcomes distant from the mean  it has fatter tails than the standard normal  distribution   As the number of degrees of freedom increases with sample size the spread  decreases and the t distribution approaches the standard normal distribution as a limit 
6,671,Why is the t distribution the focus for the hypothesis tests of this section  In practice  investment analysts need to estimate the population standard deviation by calculating a sample  standard deviation  That is the population variance  or standard deviation  is unknown  For  hypothesis tests concerning the population mean of a normally distributed population with  unknown variance the theoretically correct test statistic is the t statistic  What if a normal  distribution does not describe the population  The t test is robust to moderate departures from  normality except for outliers and strong skewness    When we have large samples departures  of the underlying distribution from the normal are of increasingly less concern  The sample  mean is approximately normally distributed in large samples according to the central limit  theorem whatever the distribution describing the population  In general a sample size of    or  more usually can be treated as a large sample and a sample size of    or less is treated as a  small sample

4,675,For large samples practitioners sometimes use a z test in place of a t test for tests concerning a  mean    The justification for using the z test in this context is twofold  First in large samples  the sample mean should follow the normal distribution at least approximately as we have  already stated fulfilling the normality assumption of the z test  Second the difference between  the rejection points for the t test and z test becomes quite small when sample size is large  For a  two sided test at the      level of significance the rejection points for a z test are      and         For a t test the rejection points are       and        for df       about a   percent  difference between the z and t rejection points  and       and        for df       about a      percent difference between the z and t rejection points   Because the t test is readily available as  statistical program output and theoretically correct for unknown population variance we present  it as the test of choice 
5,675,In a very limited number of cases we may know the population variance  in such cases the  z test is theoretically correct

4,677,The Effect of Control Deficiency Disclosures  under the Sarbanes Oxley Act on Share  Prices
5,677,The Sarbanes Oxley Act came into effect in      and introduced major changes to the  regulation of corporate governance and financial practice in the United States  One of  the requirements of this Act is for firms to periodically assess and report certain types of  internal control deficiencies to the audit committee external auditors and to the  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   When a company makes an internal  control weakness disclosure does it convey information that affects the market value of  the firm s stock 
6,677,Gupta and Nayar        addressed this question by studying a number of voluntary  disclosures made in the very early days of Sarbanes Oxley implementation  Their final  sample for this study consisted of    firms that had made control deficiency disclosures  to the SEC from March      to July       This    firm sample was termed the  full  sample   These firms were further examined to see if there were any other  contemporaneous announcements such as earnings announcements associated with the  control deficiency disclosures  Of the    firms    did not have any such confounding  announcements and the sample of these firms was termed the  clean sample  
7,677,The announcement day of the internal control weakness was designated t      If these  announcements provide new information useful for equity valuation the information  should cause a change in stock prices and returns once it is available  Only one  component of stock returns is of interest  the return in excess of that predicted given a  stock s market risk or beta called the abnormal return  Significant negative  positive   abnormal returns indicate that investors perceive unfavorable  favorable  corporate news  in the internal control weakness announcement  Although Gupta and Nayar examined  abnormal returns for various time horizons or event windows we report a selection of  their findings for the window        which includes a two day period of the day of and  the day after the announcement  The researchers chose to use z tests for statistical  significance

10,678,H   The population mean abnormal return during        equals   
11,678,Ha  The population mean abnormal return during        does not equal   
12,678,Solution to   
13,678,From the information on rejection points for z tests we know that we reject the null  hypothesis at the      significance level if z        or if z         and at the       significance level if z         or if z           The z statistic reported by the researchers  is        which is significant at the      and      levels  The null is rejected  The  control deficiency disclosures appear to contain valuation relevant information 
14,678,Because it is possible that significant results could be due to outliers the researchers  also reported the number of cases of positive and negative abnormal returns  The ratio of  cases of positive to negative abnormal returns was       which tends to support the  conclusion from the z test of statistically significant negative abnormal returns 
15,678,Solution to   
16,678,The z statistic reported by the researchers for the clean sample is        which is  significant at the      and      levels  Although both the mean abnormal return and the  z statistic are smaller in magnitude for the clean sample than for the full sample the  results continue to be statistically significant

7,679,     Tests Concerning Differences between Means
8,679,We often want to know whether a mean value for example a mean return differs between  two groups  Is an observed difference due to chance or to different underlying values for the  mean  We have two samples one for each group  When it is reasonable to believe that the  samples are from populations at least approximately normally distributed and that the samples  are also independent of each other the techniques of this section apply  We discuss two t tests  for a test concerning differences between the means of two populations  In one case the  population variances although unknown can be assumed to be equal  Then we efficiently  combine the observations from both samples to obtain a pooled estimate of the common but  unknown population variance  A pooled estimate is an estimate drawn from the combination of  two different samples  In the second case we do not assume that the unknown population  variances are equal and an approximate t test is then available  Letting    and    stand  respectively for the population means of the first and second populations we most often want  to test whether the population means although unknown are equal or whether one is larger than  the other  Thus we usually formulate the following hypotheses 
9,679,   H               versus Ha               the alternative is that         
10,679,   H               versus Ha               the alternative is that         
11,679,   H               versus Ha               the alternative is that         
12,679,We can however formulate other hypotheses such as H               versus Ha                The procedure is the same

22,684,     Tests Concerning Mean Differences
23,684,In the previous section we presented two t tests for discerning differences between population  means  The tests were based on two samples  An assumption for those tests  validity was that  the samples were independent i e  unrelated to each other  When we want to conduct tests on  two means based on samples that we believe are dependent the methods of this section apply 
24,684,The t test in this section is based on data arranged in paired observations and the test itself is  sometimes called a paired comparisons test  Paired observations are observations that are  dependent because they have something in common  A paired comparisons test is a statistical  test for differences in dependent items  For example we may be concerned with the dividend  policy of companies before and after a change in the tax law affecting the taxation of dividends   We then have pairs of  before  and  after  observations for the same companies  We may test a  hypothesis about the mean of the differences  mean differences  that we observe across  companies  In other cases the paired observations are not on the same units  For example we  may be testing whether the mean returns earned by two investment strategies were equal over a  study period  The observations here are dependent in the sense that there is one observation for  each strategy in each month and both observations depend on underlying market risk factors   Because the returns to both strategies are likely to be related to some common risk factors such  as the market return the samples are dependent  By calculating a standard error based on  differences the t test presented below takes account of correlation between the observations 
25,684,Letting A represent  after  and B  before  suppose we have observations for the random  variables XA and XB and that the samples are dependent  We arrange the observations in pairs   Let di denote the difference between two paired observations  We can use the notation di   xAi    xBi where xAi and xBi are the ith pair of observations i         n on the two variables  Let  d stand for the population mean difference  We can formulate the following hypotheses where   d  is a hypothesized value for the population mean difference

16,692,   A  greater than  or  less than  alternative hypothesis  Reject the null hypothesis at  the   significance level if the test statistic is greater than the upper   point of the  F distribution with the specified number of numerator and denominator degrees of  freedom 
17,692,Thus if we conduct a two sided test at the          level of significance we need to find the  rejection point in F tables at the                      significance level for a one sided test   Case     But a one sided test at      uses rejection points in F tables for           Case     As  an example suppose we are conducting a two sided test at the      significance level  We  calculate a value of F of      with    numerator and    denominator degrees of freedom  Using  the F tables for                in the back of the volume we find that the rejection point is        Because the value      is greater than      we reject the null hypothesis at the       significance level 
18,692,If the convention stated above is not followed and we are given a calculated value of F less than    can we still use F tables  The answer is yes  using a reciprocal property of F statistics we  can calculate the needed value  The easiest way to present this property is to show a calculation   Suppose our chosen level of significance is      for a two tailed test and we have a value of F of      with   numerator degrees of freedom and   denominator degrees of freedom  We take  the reciprocal                Then we look up this value in the F tables for        because it is  a two tailed test  with degrees of freedom reversed  F for   numerator and   denominator  degrees of freedom  In other words F       F   and      exceeds the critical value of      so  F          is significant at the      level

7,695,   OTHER ISSUES  NONPARAMETRIC  INFERENCE
8,695,The hypothesis testing procedures we have discussed to this point have two characteristics in  common  First they are concerned with parameters and second their validity depends on a  definite set of assumptions  Mean and variance for example are two parameters or defining  quantities of a normal distribution  The tests also make specific assumptions in particular  assumptions about the distribution of the population producing the sample  Any test or  procedure with either of the above two characteristics is a parametric test or procedure  In  some cases however we are concerned about quantities other than parameters of distributions   In other cases we may believe that the assumptions of parametric tests do not hold for the  particular data we have  In such cases a nonparametric test or procedure can be useful  A  nonparametric test is a test that is not concerned with a parameter or a test that makes  minimal assumptions about the population from which the sample comes   
9,695,We primarily use nonparametric procedures in three situations  when the data we use do not  meet distributional assumptions when the data are given in ranks or when the hypothesis we  are addressing does not concern a parameter

2,696,The first situation occurs when the data available for analysis suggest that the distributional  assumptions of the parametric test are not satisfied  For example we may want to test a  hypothesis concerning the mean of a population but believe that neither a t test nor a z test is  appropriate because the sample is small and may come from a markedly non normally  distributed population  In that case we may use a nonparametric test  The nonparametric test  will frequently involve the conversion of observations  or a function of observations  into ranks  according to magnitude and sometimes it will involve working with only  greater than  or   less than  relationships  using the signs   and   to denote those relationships    Characteristically one must refer to specialized statistical tables to determine the rejection  points of the test statistic at least for small samples    Such tests then typically interpret the  null hypothesis as a thesis about ranks or signs  In Table   we give examples of nonparametric  alternatives to the parametric tests we have discussed in this reading    The reader should  consult a comprehensive business statistics textbook for an introduction to such tests and a  specialist textbook for details

12,696,We pointed out that when we use nonparametric tests we often convert the original data into  ranks  In some cases the original data are already ranked  In those cases we also use  nonparametric tests because parametric tests generally require a stronger measurement scale  than ranks  For example if our data were the rankings of investment managers hypotheses  concerning those rankings would be tested using nonparametric procedures  Ranked data also  appear in many other finance contexts  For example Heaney Koga Oliver and Tran        studied the relationship between the size of Japanese companies  as measured by revenue  and  their use of derivatives  The companies studied used derivatives to hedge one or more of five  types of risk exposure  interest rate risk foreign exchange risk commodity price risk  marketable security price risk and credit risk  The researchers gave a  perceived scope of risk  exposure  score to each company that was equal to the number of types of risk exposure that  the company reported hedging  Although revenue is measured on a strong scale  a ratio scale   scope of risk exposure is measured on only an ordinal scale    The researchers thus employed  nonparametric statistics to explore the relationship between derivatives usage and size

2,697,A third situation in which we use nonparametric procedures occurs when our question does not  concern a parameter  For example if the question concerns whether a sample is random or not  we use the appropriate nonparametric test  a so called runs test   Another type of question  nonparametrics can address is whether a sample came from a population following a particular  probability distribution  using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test for example  
3,697,We end this reading by describing in some detail a nonparametric statistic that has often been  used in investment research the Spearman rank correlation 
4,697,     Tests Concerning Correlation  The Spearman Rank  Correlation Coefficient
5,697,In many contexts in investments we want to assess the strength of the linear relationship  between two variables the correlation between them  In a majority of cases we use the  correlation coefficient described in the readings on probability concepts and correlation and  regression  However the t test of the hypothesis that two variables are uncorrelated based on  the correlation coefficient relies on fairly stringent assumptions    When we believe that the  population under consideration meaningfully departs from those assumptions we can employ a  test based on the Spearman rank correlation coefficient rS  The Spearman rank correlation  coefficient is essentially equivalent to the usual correlation coefficient calculated on the ranks of the two variables  say X and Y  within their respective samples  Thus it is a number between     and    where         denotes a perfect inverse  positive  straight line relationship between  the variables and   represents the absence of any straight line relationship  no correlation   The  calculation of rS requires the following steps 
6,697,   Rank the observations on X from largest to smallest  Assign the number   to the  observation with the largest value the number   to the observation with second largest  value and so on  In case of ties we assign to each tied observation the average of the  ranks that they jointly occupy  For example if the third  and fourth largest values are  tied we assign both observations the rank of      the average of   and     Perform the  same procedure for the observations on Y 
7,697,   Calculate the difference di between the ranks of each pair of observations on X and Y

2,700,     Nonparametric Inference  Summary
3,700,Nonparametric statistical procedures extend the reach of inference because they make few  assumptions can be used on ranked data and may address questions unrelated to parameters   Quite frequently nonparametric tests are reported alongside parametric tests  The reader can  then assess how sensitive the statistical conclusion is to the assumptions underlying the  parametric test  However if the assumptions of the parametric test are met the parametric test   where available  is generally preferred to the nonparametric test because the parametric test  usually permits us to draw sharper conclusions    For complete coverage of all the  nonparametric procedures that may be encountered in the finance and investment literature it is  best to consult a specialist textbook   
4,700,SUMMARY
5,700,In this reading we have presented the concepts and methods of statistical inference and  hypothesis testing 
6,700,  A hypothesis is a statement about one or more populations 
7,700,  The steps in testing a hypothesis are as follows 
8,700,   Stating the hypotheses 
9,700,   Identifying the appropriate test statistic and its probability distribution 
10,700,   Specifying the significance level 
11,700,   Stating the decision rule 
12,700,   Collecting the data and calculating the test statistic 
13,700,   Making the statistical decision 
14,700,   Making the economic or investment decision 
15,700,  We state two hypotheses  The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested  the  alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis accepted when the null hypothesis is rejected 
16,700,  There are three ways to formulate hypotheses 
17,700,   H          versus Ha        
18,700,   H          versus Ha

2,701,where    is a hypothesized value of the population parameter and   is the true value of the  population parameter  In the above Formulation   is a two sided test and Formulations    and   are one sided tests 
3,701,  When we have a  suspected  or  hoped for  condition for which we want to find  supportive evidence we frequently set up that condition as the alternative hypothesis and  use a one sided test  To emphasize a neutral attitude however the researcher may select  a  not equal to  alternative hypothesis and conduct a two sided test 
4,701,  A test statistic is a quantity calculated on the basis of a sample whose value is the basis  for deciding whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis  To decide whether to  reject or not to reject the null hypothesis we compare the computed value of the test  statistic to a critical value  rejection point  for the same test statistic 
5,701,  In reaching a statistical decision we can make two possible errors  We may reject a true  null hypothesis  a Type I error  or we may fail to reject a false null hypothesis  a Type II  error  
6,701,  The level of significance of a test is the probability of a Type I error that we accept in  conducting a hypothesis test  The probability of a Type I error is denoted by the Greek  letter alpha    The standard approach to hypothesis testing involves specifying a level of  significance  probability of Type I error  only 
7,701,  The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null  rejecting the null  when it is false  
8,701,  A decision rule consists of determining the rejection points  critical values  with which to  compare the test statistic to decide whether to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis   When we reject the null hypothesis the result is said to be statistically significant 
9,701,  The         confidence interval represents the range of values of the test statistic for  which the null hypothesis will not be rejected at an   significance level 
10,701,  The statistical decision consists of rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis  The  economic decision takes into consideration all economic issues pertinent to the decision 
11,701,  The p value is the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis can be  rejected  The smaller the p value the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis  and in favor of the alternative hypothesis  The p value approach to hypothesis testing  does not involve setting a significance level  rather it involves computing a p value for  the test statistic and allowing the consumer of the research to interpret its significance 
12,701,  For hypothesis tests concerning the population mean of a normally distributed population  with unknown  known  variance the theoretically correct test statistic is the t statistic   z statistic   In the unknown variance case given large samples  generally samples of     or more observations  the z statistic may be used in place of the t statistic because of the  force of the central limit theorem 
13,701,  The t distribution is a symmetrical distribution defined by a single parameter  degrees of  freedom  Compared to the standard normal distribution the t distribution has fatter tails

2,702,  When we want to test whether the observed difference between two means is statistically  significant we must first decide whether the samples are independent or dependent   related   If the samples are independent we conduct tests concerning differences  between means  If the samples are dependent we conduct tests of mean differences   paired comparisons tests  
3,702,  When we conduct a test of the difference between two population means from normally  distributed populations with unknown variances if we can assume the variances are  equal we use a t test based on pooling the observations of the two samples to estimate  the common  but unknown  variance  This test is based on an assumption of independent  samples 
4,702,  When we conduct a test of the difference between two population means from normally  distributed populations with unknown variances if we cannot assume that the variances  are equal we use an approximate t test using modified degrees of freedom given by a  formula  This test is based on an assumption of independent samples 
5,702,  In tests concerning two means based on two samples that are not independent we often  can arrange the data in paired observations and conduct a test of mean differences  a  paired comparisons test   When the samples are from normally distributed populations  with unknown variances the appropriate test statistic is a t statistic  The denominator of  the t statistic the standard error of the mean differences takes account of correlation  between the samples 
6,702,  In tests concerning the variance of a single normally distributed population the test  statistic is chi square      with n     degrees of freedom where n is sample size 
7,702,  For tests concerning differences between the variances of two normally distributed  populations based on two random independent samples the appropriate test statistic is  based on an F test  the ratio of the sample variances  
8,702,  The F statistic is defined by the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom  The  numerator degrees of freedom  number of observations in the sample minus    is the  divisor used in calculating the sample variance in the numerator  The denominator  degrees of freedom  number of observations in the sample minus    is the divisor used in  calculating the sample variance in the denominator  In forming an F test a convention is  to use the larger of the two ratios s    or s     as the actual test statistic

11,702,  A parametric test is a hypothesis test concerning a parameter or a hypothesis test based on  specific distributional assumptions  In contrast a nonparametric test either is not  concerned with a parameter or makes minimal assumptions about the population from  which the sample comes 
12,702,  A nonparametric test is primarily used in three situations  when data do not meet  distributional assumptions when data are given in ranks or when the hypothesis we are  addressing does not concern a parameter 
13,702,  The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated on the ranks of two variables  within their respective samples

2,714,C  The appropriate test statistic is a z statistic because the sample comes from a  normally distributed population with known variance   The known population  standard deviation is used to compute the standard error of the mean using  Equation   in the text  
3,714,D  The appropriate test statistic is chi square      with             degrees of freedom 
4,714,E  The appropriate test statistic is the F statistic  the ratio of the sample variances  
5,714,F  The appropriate test statistic is a t statistic for a paired observations test  a paired  comparisons test  because the samples are correlated 
6,714,G  The appropriate test statistic is a t  statistic using a pooled estimate of the  population variance  The t statistic has                  degrees of freedom  This  statistic is appropriate because the populations are normally distributed with  unknown variances  because the variances are assumed equal the observations can  be pooled to estimate the common variance  The requirement of independent  samples for using this statistic has been met

5,715,D  This is a one sided test at a      significance level  In Part B of  Rejection Points  for a z Test  we find that the rejection point condition for a test with a  greater  than  alternative hypothesis is z         
6,715,A  As stated in the text we often set up the  hoped for  or  suspected  condition as  the alternative hypothesis  Here that condition is that the population value of  Willco s mean annual net income exceeds     million  Thus we have H           versus Ha         
7,715,B  Given that net income is normally distributed with unknown variance the  appropriate test statistic is t with n                 degrees of freedom 
8,715,C  In the t distribution table in the back of the book in the row for df     under           we read the rejection point  critical value  of        We will reject the null if t

2,716,The calculation of the z statistic with unknown variance as in this case is the same  as the calculation of the t statistic  The rejection point conditions for a two tailed  test are as follows  z        and z         at the      level  and z         and z           at the      level  Note that the z test is a less conservative test than the  t test so when the z test is used the null is easier to reject  Because z         is  greater than       we reject the null at the      level  we also reject the null at the       level 
3,716,In summary Analyst A s EPS forecasts appear to be biased upward they tend to  be too high 
4,716,C  For Analyst B the t test is based on t with               degrees of freedom  At  the      significance level we reject the null if t         or if t           At the       significance level we reject the null if t         or if t           We calculate  t                                                       or       Because              we reject the null at the      level  However      is not larger than        so we do not reject the null at the      level 
5,716,For a z test the rejection point conditions are the same as given in Part B and we  come to the same conclusions as with the t test  Because             we reject the  null at the      significance level  however because      is not greater than        we do not reject the null at the      level 
6,716,The mean forecast error of Analyst B is only        but because the test is based on  a large number of observations it is sufficient evidence to reject the null of mean  zero forecast errors at the      level

29,718,C  The  before  sample variance is larger so following a convention for calculating  F statistics the  before  sample variance goes in the numerator  F                          with               numerator and denominator degrees of freedom   Because this is a two tailed test we use F tables for the       level  df             Using the tables in the back of the volume the closest value to     is     degrees  of freedom  At the      level the rejection point is        Using the  Insert Function Statistical feature on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet we would find  FINV                           as the critical F value   Because       is not  greater than      we do not reject the null hypothesis that the  before  and  after   variances are equal 
30,718,    A is correct  The critical value in a decision rule is the rejection point for the test  It is the  point with which the test statistic is compared to determine whether to reject the null  hypothesis which is part of the fourth step in hypothesis testing 
31,718,    A is correct  The null hypothesis is the hypothesis to be tested  The null hypothesis is  considered to be true unless the evidence indicates that it is false in which case the  alternative hypothesis is accepted

2,719,    A is correct  If the population sampled has unknown variance and the sample is large a  z test may be used  Hypotheses involving  greater than  or  less than  postulations are  one sided  one tailed   In this situation the null and alternative hypotheses are stated as  H          and Ha         respectively  A one tailed t test is also acceptable in this  case 
3,719,    C is correct  For a one tailed hypothesis test there is a    critical value rejection region  in one tail of the distribution 
4,719,    B is correct  One tailed tests in which the alternative is  greater than  or  less than   represent the beliefs of the researcher more firmly than a  not equal to  alternative  hypothesis 
5,719,    A is correct  Calculated using a sample a test statistic is a quantity whose value is the  basis for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis 
6,719,    A is correct  The definition of a Type I error is when a true null hypothesis is rejected 
7,719,    B is correct  A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected 
8,719,    B is correct  The level of significance is used to establish the rejection points of the  hypothesis test 
9,719,   
10,719,A  We have a  not equal to  alternative hypothesis 
11,719,H         versus Ha       
12,719,B  We would use the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient to conduct  the test 
13,719,C  Mutual fund expense ratios are bounded from above and below and in practice  there is at least a lower bound on alpha  as any return cannot be less than       percent   These variables are markedly non normally distributed and the  assumptions of a parametric test are not likely to be fulfilled  Thus a nonparametric  test appears to be appropriate

29,720,We use Table    to tabulate the rejection points for a test on the Spearman rank  correlation  Given a sample size of   in a two tailed test at a      significance level  the upper tail rejection point is         we use the       column   Thus we reject  the null hypothesis if the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is less than          or greater than         Because rS is equal to        we do not reject the null  hypothesis 
30,720,    B is correct  Specifying a smaller significance level decreases the probability of a Type I  error  rejecting a true null hypothesis  but increases the probability of a Type II error  not  rejecting a false null hypothesis   As the level of significance decreases the null  hypothesis is less frequently rejected 
31,720,    B is correct  The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it  is false 
32,720,    B is correct  The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the  null when it is false  Failing to reject the null when it is false is a Type II error  Thus the  power of a hypothesis test is the probability of not committing a Type II error 
33,720,    C is correct  When a statistically significant result is also economically meaningful one  should further explore the logic of why the result might work in the future 
34,720,    A is correct  The hypothesis is a two tailed formulation  The t statistic of       falls  outside the critical rejection points of less than        and greater than       therefore  the null hypothesis is rejected  the result is statistically significant  However despite the  statistical results trying to profit on the strategy is not likely to be economically  meaningful because the return is near zero after transaction costs
35,720,    C is correct  When directly comparing the p value with the level of significance it can be  used as an alternative to using rejection points to reach conclusions on hypothesis tests  If  the p value is smaller than the specified level of significance the null hypothesis is  rejected  Otherwise the null hypothesis is not rejected 
36,720,    C is correct  The p value is the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis  can be rejected for a given value of the test statistic  The null hypothesis is rejected when  the p value is less than the specified significance level 
37,720,    A is correct  The p value is the smallest level of significance     at which the null  hypothesis can be rejected 
38,720,    C is correct  The p value is the smallest level of significance     at which the null  hypothesis can be rejected  If the p value is less than   the null can be rejected  The  smaller the p value the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis and in favor  of the alternative hypothesis  Thus the evidence for rejecting the null is strongest for Test

2,721,    B is correct  The z test is theoretically the correct test to use in those limited cases when  testing the population mean of a normally distributed population with known variance 
3,721,    A is correct  A t test is used if the sample is small and drawn from a normally or  approximately normally distributed population 
4,721,    B is correct  A t statistic is the most appropriate for hypothesis tests of the population  mean when the variance is unknown and the sample is small but the population is  normally distributed 
5,721,    A is correct  The t statistic value of        does not fall into the critical value rejection  regions           or           Instead it falls well within the acceptance region  Thus H  cannot be rejected  the result is not statistically significant at the      level 
6,721,    B is correct  The assumption that the variances are equal allows for the combining of both  samples to obtain a pooled estimate of the common variance 
7,721,    B is correct  A paired comparisons test is appropriate to test the mean differences of two  samples believed to be dependent 
8,721,    A is correct  The sample sizes for both the fund manager and the consultant s accounts  consists of forty quarterly periods of returns  However the consultant s client accounts  are a subset of the fund manager s entire account base  As such they are not independent  samples  When samples are dependent a paired comparisons test is appropriate to  conduct tests of the differences in dependent items 
9,721,    A is correct  A chi square test is used for tests concerning the variance of a single  normally distributed population 
10,721,    B is correct  An F test is used to conduct tests concerning the difference between the  variances of two normally distributed populations with random independent samples 
11,721,    A is correct  A non parametric test is used when the data are given in ranks 
12,721,    B is correct  There are only     monthly  observations over the one year of the sample  and thus the samples are small  Additionally the funds  returns are non normally  distributed  Therefore the samples do not meet the distributional assumptions for a  parametric test  The Mann Whitney U test  a nonparametric test  could be used to test the  differences between population means

2,722, Part of this discussion of the selection of hypotheses follows Bowerman O Connell and Murphree        
3,722, The central limit theorem says that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal  with mean   and variance    n when the sample size is large  The sample we will use for this example has      observations 
4,722, The power of a test is in fact   minus the probability of a Type II error 
5,722, We do not always have information on the relative power of the test for competing test statistics however 
6,722,   Rejection point  is a descriptive synonym for the more traditional term  critical value  
7,722,  The analogy in some courts of law  for example in the United States  is that if a jury does not return a verdict of  guilty  the alternative hypothesis  it is most accurate to say that the jury has failed to reject the null hypothesis  namely that the defendant is innocent 
8,722,  Just as with the hypothesis test we can use this confidence interval based on the standard normal distribution  when we have large samples  An alternative hypothesis test and confidence interval uses the t distribution which  requires concepts that we introduce in the next section 
9,722,  These issues are discussed further in the reading on sampling 
10,722,  We can use spreadsheets to calculate p values as well  In Microsoft Excel for example we may use the  worksheet functions TTEST NORMSDIST CHIDIST and FDIST to calculate p values for t tests z tests chi  square tests and F tests respectively 
11,722,  Davidson and MacKinnon        argued the merits of this approach   The P value approach does not  necessarily force us to make a decision about the null hypothesis  If we obtain a P value of say          we will  almost certainly want to reject the null  But if we obtain a P value of say      or even       we are not obliged to reject it  We may simply file the result away as information that casts some doubt on the null hypothesis but that  is not by itself conclusive  We believe that this somewhat agnostic attitude toward test statistics in which they are  merely regarded as pieces of information that we may or may not want to act upon is usually the most sensible one  to take    p     
12,722,  When we want to test whether the population means of more than two populations are equal we use analysis of  variance  ANOVA   We introduce ANOVA in its most common application regression analysis in the reading on  correlation and regression analysis 
13,722,  The formula for the variance of a t distribution is df  df      
14,722,  See Moore McCabe and Craig         A statistic is robust if the required probability calculations are  insensitive to violations of the assumptions 
15,722,  Although this generalization is useful we caution that the sample size needed to obtain an approximately normal  sampling distribution for the sample mean depends on how non normal the original population is  For some  populations  large  may be a sample size well in excess of    
16,722,  A technical note for reference is required  When the sample comes from a finite population estimates of the  standard error of the mean whether from Equation   or Equation   overestimate the true standard error  To  address this the computed standard error is multiplied by a shrinkage factor called the finite population correction  factor  fpc  equal to   N   n     N      where N is the population size and n is the sample size  When the  sample size is small relative to the population size  less than   percent of the population size  the fpc is usually  ignored  The overestimation problem arises only in the usual situation of sampling without replacement  after an  item is selected it cannot be picked again  as opposed to sampling with replacement 
17,722,  This measure represents the average length of time that the business must wait after making a sale before  receiving payment  The calculation is  Accounts receivable   Average sales per day

2,723,  These practitioners choose between t tests and z tests based on sample size  For small samples  n       they use  a t test and for large samples a z test 
3,723,  For example in Monte Carlo simulation we prespecify the probability distributions for the risk factors  If we  use a normal distribution we know the true values of mean and variance  Monte Carlo simulation involves the use  of a computer to represent the operation of a system subject to risk  we discuss Monte Carlo simulation in the  reading on common probability distributions 
4,723,  We can also use the following equivalent expression which makes use of the correlation between the two  variables  s  d    s  B    r  XA XB   sA sB  n where s  A is the sample variance of XA s  B is the sample  variance of XB and r XA XB  is the sample correlation between XA and XB 
5,723,A   s 
6,723,  Just as with other hypothesis tests the chi square test can be given a confidence interval interpretation  Unlike  confidence intervals based on z  or t statistics however chi square confidence intervals for variance are  asymmetric  A two sided confidence interval for population variance based on a sample of size n has a lower limit      and an upper limit U    n      s             Under the null hypothesis the hypothesized value  of the population variance should fall within these two limits 
7,723,L    n      s    
8,723,  The relationship between the chi square and F distributions is as follows  If      is one chi square random  variable with m degrees of freedom and      is another chi square random variable with n degrees of freedom then    n  follows an F distribution with m numerator and n denominator degrees of freedom 
9,723,  m       
10,723,F      
11,723,  Some writers make a distinction between  nonparametric  and  distribution free  tests  They refer to procedures  that do not concern the parameters of a distribution as nonparametric and to procedures that make minimal  assumptions about the underlying distribution as distribution free  We follow a commonly accepted inclusive  usage of the term nonparametric 
12,723,  For large samples there is often a transformation of the test statistic that permits the use of tables for the  standard normal or t distribution 
13,723,  In some cases there are several nonparametric alternatives to a parametric test 
14,723,  See for example Hettmansperger and McKean        or Siegel and Castellan        
15,723,  We discussed scales of measurement in the reading on statistical concepts and market returns 
16,723,  The t test is described in the reading on correlation and regression  The assumption of the test is that each  observation  x y  on the two variables  X Y  is a random observation from a bivariate normal distribution   Informally in a bivariate or two variable normal distribution each individual variable is normally distributed and  their joint relationship is completely described by the correlation   between them  For more details see for  example Daniel and Terrell        
17,723,  Calculating the usual correlation coefficient on the ranks would yield approximately the same result as Equation     
18,723,  The expense ratio  the ratio of a fund s operating expenses to average net assets  is bounded both from below   by zero  and from above  The Sharpe ratio is also observed within a limited range in practice  Thus neither  variable can be normally distributed and hence jointly they cannot follow a bivariate normal distribution  In short  the assumptions of a t test are not met 
19,723,  To use a concept introduced in an earlier section the parametric test is often more powerful

2,725,   INTRODUCTION
3,725,Technical analysis has been used by traders and analysts for centuries but it has only recently  achieved broad acceptance among regulators and the academic community  This reading gives a  brief overview of the field compares technical analysis with other schools of analysis and  describes some of the main tools in technical analysis  Some applications of technical analysis  are subjective  That is although certain aspects such as the calculation of indicators have  specific rules the interpretation of findings is often subjective and based on the long term  context of the security being analyzed  This aspect is similar to fundamental analysis which has  specific rules for calculating ratios for example but introduces subjectivity in the evaluation  phase 
4,725,   TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  DEFINITION AND  SCOPE
5,725,Technical analysis is a form of security analysis that uses price and volume data which is  often graphically displayed in decision making  Technical analysis can be used for securities in  any freely traded market around the globe  A freely traded market is one in which willing  buyers trade with willing sellers without external intervention or impediment  Prices are the  result of the interaction of supply and demand in real time  Technical analysis is used on a wide  range of financial instruments including equities bonds commodity futures and currency  futures 
6,725,The underlying logic of technical analysis is simple 
7,725,  Supply and demand determine prices 
8,725,  Changes in supply and demand cause changes in prices 
9,725,  Prices can be projected with charts and other technical tools 
10,725,Technical analysis of any financial instrument does not require detailed knowledge of that  instrument  As long as the chart represents the action in a freely traded market a technician  does not even need to know the name or type of the security to conduct the analysis  Technical  analysis can also be applied over any time frame from short term price movements to long  term movements of annual closing prices  Trends that are apparent in short term charts may  also appear over longer time frames  Because fundamental analysis is more time consuming  than technical analysis investors with short term time horizons such as traders tend to prefer  technical analysis but not always  For example fundamental analysts with long time frames  often perform technical analysis to time the purchase and sale of the securities they have  analyzed

2,726,     Principles and Assumptions
3,726,Technical analysis can be thought of as the study of collective investor psychology or  sentiment  Prices in any freely traded market are set by human beings or their automated  proxies  such as computerized trading programs  and price is set at the equilibrium between  supply and demand at any instant in time  Various fundamental theorists have proposed that  markets are efficient and rational but technicians believe that humans are often irrational and  emotional and that they tend to behave similarly in similar circumstances 
4,726,Although fundamental data are key inputs into the determination of value these data are  analyzed by humans who may be driven at least partially by factors other than rational  factors   Human behavior is often erratic and driven by emotion in many aspects of one s life  so technicians conclude that it is unreasonable to believe that investing is the one exception  where humans always behave rationally  Technicians believe that market trends and patterns  reflect this irrational human behavior  Thus technical analysis is the study of market trends or  patterns  And technicians believe the trends and patterns tend to repeat themselves and are  therefore somewhat predictable  So technicians rely on recognition of patterns that have  occurred in the past in an attempt to project future patterns of security prices 
5,726,Another tenet of technical analysis is that the market reflects the collective knowledge and  sentiment of many varied participants and the amount of buying and selling activity in a  particular security  In a freely traded market only those market participants who actually buy or  sell a security have an impact on price  And the greater the volume of a participant s trades the  more impact that market participant will have on price  Those with the best information and  most conviction have more say in setting prices than others because the informed traders trade  higher volumes  To make use of their information however they must trade  Technical analysis  relies on knowledgeable market participants putting this knowledge to work by trading in the  market thereby influencing prices and volume  Without trading the information is not captured  in the charts  Arguably although insider trading is illegal for a variety of reasons it improves  the efficiency of technical analysis 
6,726,Trades determine volume and price  The impact occurs instantaneously and frequently  anticipates fundamental developments correctly  So by studying market technical data price  and volume trends the technician is seeking to understand investor sentiment  The technician  is benefiting from the wide range of knowledge of market participants and the collective  conclusion of market participants about a security  In contrast the fundamental analyst must  wait for the release of financial statements to conduct financial statement analysis so a time lag  occurs between the market s activities and the analyst s conclusions 
7,726,Charles Dow creator in      of what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  described the collective action of participants in the markets as follows 
8,726,The market reflects all the jobber knows about the condition of the textile trade  all  the banker knows about the money market  all that the best informed president  knows of his own business together with his knowledge of all other businesses  it  sees the general condition of transportation in a way that the president of no single  railroad can ever see  it is better informed on crops than the farmer or even the  Department of Agriculture  In fact the market reduces to a bloodless verdict all  knowledge bearing on finance both domestic and foreign 
9,726,A similar notion was expressed by George A  Akerlof and Robert J  Shiller

2,727,To understand how economies work and how we can manage them and prosper we  must pay attention to the thought patterns that animate people s ideas and feelings  their animal spirits  We will never really understand important economic events  unless we confront the fact that their causes are largely mental in nature  
3,727,Market participants use many inputs and analytical tools before trading  Fundamental analysis  is a key input in determining security prices but it is not the only one  Technical analysts  believe that emotions play a role  Investors with a favorable fundamental view may nonetheless  sell a financial instrument for other reasons including pessimistic investor sentiment margin  calls and requirements for their capital for example to pay for a child s college tuition   Technicians do not care why market participants are buying or selling just that they are doing  so 
4,727,Some financial instruments have an associated income stream that contributes to the security s  intrinsic value  Bonds have regular coupon payments and equity shares may have underlying  cash flows or dividend streams  A fundamental analyst can adjust these cash flows for risk and  use standard time value of money techniques to determine a present value  Other assets such as  a bushel of wheat gallon of crude oil or ounce of silver do not have underlying financial  statements or an income stream so valuation models cannot be used to derive their fundamental  intrinsic values  For these assets technical analysis is the only form of analysis possible  So  whereas fundamental analysis is widely used in the analysis of fixed income and equity  securities technical analysis is widely used in the analysis of commodities currencies and  futures 
5,727,Market participants attempt to anticipate economic developments and enter into trades to profit  from them  Technicians believe that security price movements occur before fundamental  developments unfold certainly before they are reported  This belief is reflected in the fact that  stock prices are one of the    components of the National Bureau of Economic Research s  Index of Leading Economic Indicators  A key tenet of technical analysis is that the equity  market moves roughly six months ahead of inflection points in the broad economy 
6,727,     Technical and Fundamental Analysis
7,727,Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are both useful and valid but they approach the  market in different ways  Technicians focus solely on analyzing markets and the trading of  financial instruments  Fundamental analysis is a much wider field encompassing financial and  economic analysis as well as analysis of societal and political trends  Technicians analyze the  result of this extensive fundamental analysis in terms of how it affects market prices  A  technician s analysis is derived solely from price and volume data whereas a fundamental  equity analyst analyzes a company and incorporates data that are external to the market and then  uses this analysis to predict security price movements  As the quotation from Dow in Section      illustrates technical analysis assumes that all of the factors considered by a fundamental  analyst are reflected in the price of a financial instrument through buying and selling activity

2,728,A key distinction between technical analysis and fundamental analysis is that the technician has  more concrete data primarily price and volume data to work with  The financial statements  analyzed by fundamental analysts are not objective data but are the result of numerous estimates  and assumptions that have been added together to arrive at the line items in the financial  statements  Even the cash line on a balance sheet is subject to corporate management s opinion  about which securities are liquid enough to be considered  cash   This opinion must be agreed  to by auditors and in many countries regulators  who sometimes differ with the auditors    Financial statements are subject to restatements because of such issues as changes in accounting  assumptions and even fraud  But the price and volume data used in technical analysis are  objective  When the data become subject to analysis however both types of analysis become  subjective because judgment is exercised when a technician analyzes a price chart and when a  fundamental analyst analyzes an income statement 
3,728,Fundamental analysis can be considered to be the more theoretical approach because it seeks to  determine the underlying long term  or intrinsic  value of a security  Technical analysis can be  considered to be the more practical because a technician studies the markets and financial  instruments as they exist even if trading activity appears at times to be irrational  Technicians  seek to project the level at which a financial instrument will trade whereas fundamental  analysts seek to predict where it should trade 
4,728,Being a fundamental analyst can be lonely if the analyst is the first to arrive at a fundamental  conclusion even though it is correct because deviations from intrinsic value can persist for  long periods  The reason these deviations may persist is that it takes buying activity to raise  or  lower  the price of a security in a freely traded market 
5,728,A drawback of technical analysis is that technicians are limited to studying market movements  and do not use other predictive analytical methods such as interviewing the customers of a  subject company to determine future demand for a company s products  Technicians study  market trends and are mainly concerned with a security s price trend  Is the security trading up  down or sideways  Trends are driven by collective investor psychology however and can  change without warning  Additionally it can take some time for a trend to become evident   Thus technicians may make wrong calls and have to change their opinions  Technicians are  better at identifying market moves after the moves are already under way 
6,728,Moreover trends and patterns must be in place for some time before they are recognizable so a  key shortcoming of technical analysis is that it can be late in identifying changes in trends or  patterns  This shortcoming mirrors a key shortcoming of fundamental analysis in that securities  often overshoot fundamental fair values in an uptrend and undershoot fundamental fair values  in a downtrend  Strictly relying on price targets obtained by fundamental analysis can lead to  closing profitable investment positions too early because investors may irrationally bid  securities prices well above or well below intrinsic value 
7,728,Fundamental analysis is a younger field than technical analysis because reliable fundamental  data are a relatively new phenomenon  In contrast the first recorded use of technical analysis  was in Japan in the     s where it was used to analyze trading in the rice market  The Japanese  developed a detailed field of technical analysis with their own chart design and patterns  These  tools were translated and widely understood outside Japan only in the     s

2,729,Western use of technical analysis was pioneered by Dow who was also the first editor of the  Wall Street Journal in the     s  At the time publicly traded companies were under no  requirement to release their financial information even to shareholders and insider trading was  common and legal  Dow created the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Railroad  Average  now the Transportation Average  as a proxy to gauge the health of the economy  because fundamental data were not available  By his logic if industrial stocks were doing well  industrial companies themselves must be doing well and if railroad stocks were doing well  railroad companies must be doing well  And if both manufacturers and the companies that  transported goods to market were prospering the economy as a whole must be prospering 
3,729,Not until the Securities Exchange Act of      were public companies in the United States  required to regularly file financial statements that were available to the public  In that year  Benjamin Graham published his seminal work Security Analysis and three years later he and  several others founded one of the first societies devoted to fundamental analysis the New York  Society of Security Analysts   Fundamental analysis quickly overtook technical analysis in  terms of acceptance by practitioners regulators and academics 
4,729,Acceptance of technical analysis by practitioners was revived in the     s with the creation of  the Market Technicians Association in New York and the International Federation of Technical  Analysts a few years later  Only in the last decade however has the field started to achieve  widespread acceptance by regulators and academics  An important impediment to acceptance  by academics is the difficulty of capturing the subjectivity involved in technical analysis  The  human brain can recognize analyze and interpret technical information that is difficult for  statistical computer models to recognize and test 
5,729,Although technical analysis can be applied to any freely traded security it does have its limits   In markets that are subject to large outside manipulation the application of technical analysis is  limited  For example the central banks of many countries intervene in their currency markets  from time to time to maintain exchange rate stability  Interestingly traders claim to have been  able to successfully predict interventions in some countries especially those where the central  bank is itself using technical analysis  Technical analysis is also limited in illiquid markets  where even modestly sized trades can have an inordinate impact on prices  For example in  considering a thinly traded American Depositary Receipt  ADR  analyzing the more heavily  traded local security frequently yields a better analysis   Another example of when technical  analysis may give an incorrect reading is in the case of a company that has declared bankruptcy  and announced that its shares will have zero value in a restructuring  A positive technical trend  may appear in such cases as investors who hold short positions buy shares to close out their  positions 
6,729,A good example of when technical analysis is a superior tool to fundamental analysis is in the  case of securities fraud such as occurred at Enron Corporation and WorldCom  These  companies were issuing fraudulent financial statements but many fundamental analysts  continued to hold favorable views of the companies  equity securities even as the share prices  declined  Simultaneously a small group of investors came to the opposite view and expressed  this view through high volume sales of the securities  The result was clearly negative chart  patterns that could then be discerned by technical analysis

2,730,   TECHNICAL ANALYSIS TOOLS
3,730,The primary tools used in technical analysis are charts and indicators  Charts are the graphical  display of price and volume data and the display may be done in a number of ways  Charts are  then subjected to various analyses including the identification of trends patterns and cycles   Technical indicators include a variety of measures of relative price level for example price  momentum market sentiment and funds flow  We will discuss charts first 
4,730,     Charts
5,730,Charts are an essential component of the technical analyst s toolkit  Charts provide information  about past price behavior and provide a basis for inferring likely future price behavior  A  variety of charts can be useful in studying the markets  The selection of the chart to use in  technical analysis is determined by the intended purpose of the analysis 
6,730,       Line Chart
7,730,Line charts are familiar to all types of analysts and are a simple graphic display of price trends  over time  Usually the chart is a plot of data points such as share price with a line connecting  these points  Line charts are typically drawn with closing prices as the data points  The vertical  axis  y axis  reflects price level and the horizontal axis  x axis  is time  Even though the line  chart is the simplest chart an analyst can quickly glean information from this chart 
8,730,The chart in Exhibit   is a quarterly chart of the FTSE     Index from      through mid        Up years and down years are clearly evident  The strong rally from      through      and the  market decline from late      to late      are also clearly visible  The           rally did not  exceed the high reached in      which suggests that investors were not willing to pay as high a  price for stocks on the London Stock Exchange during that rally as they were in the prior rally   This information provides a broad overview of investor sentiment and can lead to further  analysis  Importantly the analyst can access and analyze this information quickly  Collecting  and analyzing the full array of data normally incorporated in fundamental analysis would take  much longer

3,731,A line chart has one data point per time interval  A bar chart in contrast has four bits of data  in each entry the high and low price encountered during the time interval plus the opening and  closing prices  Such charts can be constructed for any time period but they are customarily  constructed from daily data 
4,731,As Exhibit   shows a vertical line connects the high and low price of the day  a cross hatch to  the right indicates the closing price and a cross hatch to the left indicates the opening price   The appeal of this chart is that the analyst immediately gets a sense of the nature of that day s  trading  A short bar indicates little price movement during the day  that is the high low and  close were near the opening price  A long bar indicates a wide divergence between the high and  the low for the day

5,732,Candlestick charts trace their roots to Japan where technical analysis has been in use for  centuries  Like a bar chart a candlestick chart also provides four prices per data point entry   the opening and closing prices and the high and low prices during the period  As shown in  Exhibit   a vertical line represents the range through which the security price traveled during  the time period  The line is known as the wick or shadow  The body of the candle is shaded if  the opening price was higher than the closing price and the body is clear if the opening price  was lower than the closing price

2,734,The advantage of the candlestick chart over the bar chart is that price moves are much more  visible in the candlestick chart which allows faster analysis  The bar chart indicates market  volatility only by the height of each bar but in candlestick charts the difference between  opening and closing prices and their relationship to the highs and lows of the day are clearly  apparent  Compare the sixth candle with the twelfth in Exhibit    In the sixth candle the analyst  can see significant volatility because the high of the day and low of the day are so far apart  The  stock opened near the low of the day and closed near the high suggesting a steady rally during  the day  In contrast the twelfth candle shows that the shares opened and closed at the same  price creating a cross pattern  In Japanese terminology used in candlestick charting this pattern  is called a doji  The doji signifies that after a full day of trading the positive price influence of  buyers and the negative price influence of sellers exactly counteracted each other which tells  the analyst that this market is in balance  If a doji occurs at the end of a long uptrend or  downtrend it signals that the trend will probably reverse 
3,734,       Point and Figure Chart
4,734,Point and figure charts were widely used in the United States in the early     s and were  favored because they were easy to create and update manually in the era before computers  As  with any technical analysis tool these charts can be used with equities fixed income securities  commodities or foreign exchange 
5,734,Who originated the point and figure chart is unclear  they are referred to in a number of  books in the United States dating back to       The methodology evolved until      when the  first book was published on the topic  The Point and Figure Method of Anticipating Stock Price  Movements by Victor de Villiers and Owen Taylor  With the advent of powerful charting  software and internet websites complex chart types such as the candlestick chart have become  more popular  But point and figure charts still offer tremendous value if one knows their  limitations and their advantages  The key reason this knowledge is necessary as explained  below is that point and figure charts are constructed differently from other charts  they have a  clear focus on entry and exit levels but no focus on holding periods 
6,734,As illustrated in Exhibit   a point and figure chart is drawn on a grid and consists of columns of  X s alternating with columns of O s  Neither time nor volume are represented on this type of  chart and the horizontal axis represents the number of changes in price not time  Movement  along the horizontal axis does reflect the passage of time but not in any uniform fashion  The  analyst makes entries on a point and figure chart only when the price changes by the  box size   which is explained below  This lack of a normal time dimension is perhaps the most unusual  characteristic of a point and figure chart

3,735,Note  The box size is HK   and the reversal size is three 
4,735,To construct a point and figure chart the analyst must determine both the box size and the  reversal size  Box size refers to the change in price represented by the height of each box  boxes  are generally square but the width has no meaning   In Exhibit   the box size is HK    The  reversal size is used to determine when to create a new column  In Exhibit   the reversal size is  three meaning a reversal in price of three or more boxes 
5,735,Although a point and figure chart can be constructed in several ways these charts are always  drawn on graph paper to facilitate seeing the  columns and rows  nature of the data  The  vertical axis measures discrete increments of price  For example an analyst in Europe might  draw a    chart a    chart or any other increment  In a    chart boxes would be    apart  e g                whereas in a    chart they would be    apart                The most  commonly used box size is   unit of currency which is used when prices range from    to      per share of the currency 
6,735,The next decision the technician needs to make is the reversal size  The most common size is  three meaning a reversal in price of three or more boxes     in the case of a box size of       This use of a multibox reversal helps eliminate  noise  in the price data   Noise refers to short  term trading volatility that does not alter the long term trend of the security

2,736,In a point and figure chart X represents an increase in price and O represents a decline in price   In constructing a chart the technician draws an X in a column of boxes every time the security  price closes up by the amount of the box size   Ideally all security prices are considered on an  intraday basis but this practice has given way to using closing prices only   If the price  increases by twice the box size the technician draws two X s to fill in two boxes one on top of  the other  The technician fills in more boxes for larger price moves  The resulting column starts  at the opening price level and extends to the closing price level  As long as the security keeps  closing at higher prices the technician keeps filling in boxes with X s which makes the column  higher and higher  If the price does not increase by at least the box size no indication is made  on the chart  Thus in some cases the chart is not updated for long periods but no indication of  this passage of time is made on the chart 
3,736,The reversal size determines when to create a new column  In the case of a    box size and  three box reversal size a decline of    or more would result in the technician shifting to the  next column over and beginning a column of O s  The first box to be filled in is to the right and  below the highest X in the prior column  The technician then fills in an O to bring the column  down to the price level at the close  Again each filled in box  if the box size is     represents a     decline in the security price  As long as the downtrend continues without a    increase in  price the technician continues adding O s to the column below the prior O s  A reversal in the  downtrend by at least the amount of the reversal size prompts the technician to move to the next  column and begin drawing a series of X s again  Computer technology makes the process easy  but many technicians prefer to keep point and figure charts on their wall and update them  manually because doing so provides a vivid reminder of the market trend 
4,736,Point and figure charts are particularly useful for making trading decisions because they clearly  illustrate price levels that may signal the end of a decline or advance  They also clearly show  price levels at which a security may frequently trade  In using the point size and reversal size to  make trading decisions for uptrends or columns of X s the practitioner would maintain long  positions  The reversal size could be considered the amount of loss that would prompt the  closing of a long position and the establishment of a new short position  The larger the reversal  size the fewer columns in the chart and the longer uptrends and downtrends will run 
5,736,The box size can be varied in relation to the security price  For a security with a very low  price say below    a    box size might mean few or no updates on the chart because the  price would only rarely change by this amount  Thus the technician could reduce the box size  to cents  For highly priced securities much larger box sizes could be used  The reversal size is a  multiple of the box size so if the box size is changed the reversal size changes  Practitioners  who want fewer columns or trade signals can use a large reversal size 
6,736,Analysis of a point and figure chart is relatively straightforward as long as the technician  understands its construction and limitations  The chart is relatively simple and repeated high  and low prices are evident  Congestion areas where a security trades up and down in a narrow  range are evidenced by a series of short columns of X s and O s spanning roughly the same  price range  Major sustained price moves are represented by long columns of X s  when prices  are moving up  or O s  when prices are moving down

2,737,       Scale
3,737,For any chart line bar or candlestick the vertical axis can be constructed with either a  linear scale  also known as an arithmetic scale  or a logarithmic scale depending on how  you want to view the data  With a logarithmic scale equal vertical distances on the chart  correspond to an equal percentage change  A logarithmic scale is appropriate when the data  move through a range of values representing several orders of magnitude  e g  from    to          a linear scale is better suited for narrower ranges  e g  prices from     to       The  share price history of a particular company for instance is usually best suited to a linear scale  because the data range is usually narrow 
4,737,The horizontal axis shows the passage of time  The appropriate time interval depends on the  nature of the underlying data and the specific use of the chart  An active trader for instance  may find    minute   minute or even tick by tick data useful but other technical analysts may  prefer daily or weekly data  In general the greater the volatility of the data the greater the  likelihood that an analyst can find useful information in more frequent data sampling 
5,737,Consider Exhibits   and   which both show the yearly history of the Dow Jones Industrial  Average  DJIA  from      to       Plotting the index on a linear scale as in Exhibit   makes  it difficult to gather much information from the first    years of the data series  Analysts can see  a slight uptrend but not much else  The eye is drawn to the bull market of the     s the  subsequent dot com bubble and the recent era of the subprime crisis  When plotted on a  logarithmic scale as in Exhibit   however many people would find that the data tell a more  comprehensive story  The Great Depression of the     s stands out but over the following     years the data follow a relatively stable upward trend

3,738,       Volume
4,738,Volume is an important characteristic that is included at the bottom of many charts  see for  example Exhibit    Volume is used to assess the strength or conviction of buyers and sellers in  determining a security s price  For example on a daily price chart below the price section  would be a column chart showing the volume traded for that day 
5,738,Some technicians consider volume information to be crucial  If volume increases during a time  frame in which price is also increasing that combination is considered positive and the two  indicators are said to  confirm  each other  The signal would be interpreted to mean that over  time more and more investors are buying the financial instrument and they are doing so at  higher and higher prices  This pattern is considered a positive technical development 
6,738,Conversely if volume and price diverge for example if a stock s price rises while its volume  declines the implication is that fewer and fewer market participants are willing to buy that  stock at the new price  If this trend in volume continues the price rally will soon end because  demand for the security at higher prices will cease  Exhibit   shows a chart for Toronto  Dominion Bank  TD Bank  with volume displayed separately

3,739,       Time Intervals
4,739,Most of the chart examples in this reading are daily price charts in that they show the price and  volume on a daily basis  Daily frequency is not required however because charts can be  constructed by using any time interval  For short term trading the analyst can create charts with  one minute or shorter intervals  For long term investing the analyst can use weekly monthly  or even annual intervals  The same analytical approach applies irrespective of the time interval   Using long intervals allows the analyst to chart longer time periods than does using short time  intervals for the simple reason that long intervals contain fewer data points so a longer time  frame can be presented on the chart  Using short intervals allows the analyst to see more detail   A useful step for many analysts is to begin the analysis of a security with the chart for a long  time frame such as a weekly or monthly chart and then construct charts with shorter and  shorter time intervals such as daily or hourly charts

6,739,Relative strength analysis is widely used to compare the performance of a particular asset  such as a common stock with that of some benchmark such as in the case of common stocks  the FTSE     the Nikkei     or the S P     Index or the performance of another security   The intent is to show out  or underperformance of the individual issue relative to some other  index or asset  Typically the analyst prepares a line chart of the ratio of two prices with the  asset under analysis as the numerator and with the benchmark or other security as the  denominator  A rising line shows the asset is performing better than the index or other stock  a  declining line shows the opposite  A flat line shows neutral performance

4,740,The units on the vertical axis are not significant  the ratio is a function of the relative prices of  the assets under consideration  The important information is how the ratio has changed  This  type of chart allows an analyst to make a visual determination of that change  As Exhibit    illustrates Harley Davidson was a strong performer in March and April but lagged the index  beginning in May  In contrast the stock of Rodman and Renshaw began a significant rise in  mid May that outperformed the market average

2,741,     Trend
3,741,The concept of a trend is perhaps the most important aspect of technical analysis  Trend  analysis is based on the observation that market participants tend to act in herds and that trends  tend to stay in place for some time  A security can be considered to be in an upward trend a  downward trend a sideways trend or no apparent trend  Not all securities are in a trend and  little useful forecasting information can be gleaned from technical analysis when a security is  not in a trend  Not every chart will have obvious or clear implications so the analyst must avoid  the temptation to force a conclusion from every chart and thus reach a wrong interpretation 
4,741,An uptrend for a security is when the price goes to higher highs and higher lows  As the  security moves up in price each subsequent new high is higher than the prior high and each  time there is a retracement which is a reversal in the movement of the security s price it must  stop at a higher low than the prior lows in the trend period  To draw an uptrend line a  technician draws a line connecting the lows of the price chart  Major breakdowns in price  however when the price drops through and below the trendline by a significant amount  many  technicians use      percent below the trendline  indicate that the uptrend is over and may  signal a further decline in the price  Minor breakthroughs below previous lows simply call for  the line to be moderately adjusted over time  Time is also a consideration in trends  The longer  the security price stays below the trendline the more meaningful the breakdown is considered  to be 
5,741,In an uptrend the forces of demand are greater than the forces of supply  So traders are willing  to pay higher and higher prices for the same asset over time  Presumably the strong demand  indicates that investors believe the intrinsic value of the security is increasing 
6,741,A downtrend is when a security makes lower lows and lower highs  As the security moves  down in price each subsequent new high must be lower than the prior high and each time there  is a retracement it must stop at a lower low than the prior lows in the trend period  To draw a  downtrend line a technician draws a line connecting the highs of the price chart  Major  breakouts above the downtrend line  e g       percent  indicate that the downtrend is over and  a rise in the security s price may occur  And as with an uptrend the longer the security price  stays above the trendline the more meaningful the breakout is considered to be 
7,741,In a downtrend supply is overwhelming demand  Over time sellers are willing to accept lower  and lower prices to exit long positions or enter new short positions  Both motives of the sellers  generally indicate deteriorating investor sentiment about the asset  However selling may be  prompted by factors not related to the fundamental or intrinsic value of the stock  For example  investors may be forced to sell to meet margin calls in their portfolios  From a purely technical  standpoint the reason is irrelevant  The downtrend is assumed to continue until contrary  technical evidence appears  Combining fundamental analysis with technical analysis in such a  case however might reveal a security that has attractive fundamentals but a currently negative  technical position  In uptrends however a security with an attractive technical position but  unattractive fundamentals is rare because most buying activity is driven by traders who expect  the security price to increase in the future  The rare exception is covering short positions after a  sizable decline in the share price 
8,741,A security may trade in a fairly narrow range moving sideways on the price chart without much  upward or downward movement  This pattern indicates a relative balance between supply and  demand  A technical analyst may not expect to profit from long or short trades in such securities  but might devise profitable option strategies for short term investors with the ability to accept  the risks

2,742,Exhibit    shows the application of trend analysis  Depicted is an uptrend line for the shares of  China Mobile Limited  Note that through late      every rally took the shares to a new high  whereas sell offs stopped at increasingly higher levels  The first sign of trouble came in the  spring of      when the rally terminated at a lower price point than the prior rally of late        This movement was followed by the shares breaking through the trendline

4,742,The chart in Exhibit    covers roughly seven years and would most likely be used by investors  with a long time horizon  Investors with a shorter horizon might use a chart with a shorter time  frame and would thus obtain a different trendline as well as a different trendline breakdown 
5,742,Two concepts related to trend are support and resistance  Support is defined as a low price  range in which buying activity is sufficient to stop the decline in price  It is the opposite of  resistance which is a price range in which selling is sufficient to stop the rise in price  The  psychology behind the concepts of support and resistance is that investors have come to a  collective consensus about the price of a security  Support and resistance levels can be sloped  lines as in trendlines or horizontal lines 
6,742,A key tenet of support and resistance as a part of technical analysis is the change in polarity  principle which states that once a support level is breached it becomes a resistance level  The  same holds true for resistance levels  once breached they become support levels  For example  if the price of a security never rises above SFr   over a long period of time and begins to  decline each time it reaches this level but then finally breaks through this level by a significant  amount the point to which the price rises becomes a support level

2,743,Support and resistance levels are commonly round numbers  Support indicates that at some  price level investors consider a security to be an attractive investment and are willing to buy  even in the wake of a sharp decline  and for resistance at some level investors are not willing  to buy even in an uptrend   The fact that these price points tend to be round numbers strongly  suggests that human sentiment is at work 
3,743,One of the most widely publicized examples of support and resistance is when the DJIA broke  through the       mark in      shown in Exhibit     Previously       had been viewed as a  resistance line but from      through the end of the chart in            served as a support  level

5,743,     Chart Patterns
6,743,Chart patterns are formations that appear in price charts that create some type of recognizable  shape  Common patterns appear repeatedly and often lead to similar subsequent price  movements  Thus the identification and analysis of chart patterns is a common aspect of  technical analysis used to predict security prices  An important connection to understand is that  patterns form as a result of the behavior of market participants and that these patterns represent  graphical depictions of the collective psychology of the market at a given time

2,744,The recurring patterns that appear in charts can be used as a basis for market forecasting  The  reason chart patterns have predictive value is that they are graphic representations of human  trading activity and human behavior is frequently repeated especially trading activity that is  driven by fear  in market sell offs  or hope and greed  as evidenced in bubbles that is rallies  that extend well beyond valuation levels that would be derived by fundamental values   An  example of a rally driven by greed is the recent real estate bubble which took home prices to  unsustainably high levels  This bubble started a few years after the internet stock bubble of the      s which also took prices to unsustainably high levels  In bubbles investors driven by hope  and greed drive the price of an asset to irrationally high levels in the expectation that another  buyer will be willing to pay an even higher price for the asset  The housing bubble was notable  because it so closely followed the internet stock bubble despite all that had been written about  the  irrational exuberance  of the internet bubble of the     s 
3,744,Chart patterns can be divided into two categories  reversal patterns and continuation  patterns  These terms refer to the trend for the security in question prior to the formation of the  pattern  The most important concept to understand in using chart patterns is that without a clear  trend in place prior to the pattern the pattern has no predictive value  This aspect is frequently  forgotten by investors who are so eager to identify and use patterns that they forget the proper  application of charts 
4,744,       Reversal Patterns
5,744,As the name implies a reversal pattern signals the end of a trend a change in direction of the  financial instrument s price  Evidence that the trend is about to change direction is obviously  important so reversal patterns are noteworthy 
6,744,         Head and Shoulders
7,744,Perhaps the most widely recognized reversal pattern is the head and shoulders pattern  The  pattern consists of three segments  Volume is an important characteristic in interpreting this  pattern  Because head and shoulders indicates a trend reversal a clear trend must exist prior to  the formation of the pattern in order for the pattern to have predictive validity  For a head and  shoulders pattern the prior trend must be an uptrend  Later we will discuss the inverse head  and shoulders pattern  preceded by a downtrend  
8,744,Exhibit    depicts a head and shoulders pattern for Marvell Technology Group during        The three parts of the pattern are as follows 
9,744,  Left shoulder  This part appears to show a strong rally with the slope of the rally being  greater than the prior uptrend on strong volume  The rally then reverses back to the price  level where it started forming an inverted V pattern but on lower volume 
10,744,  Head  The head is a more pronounced version of the left shoulder  A rally following the  first shoulder takes the security to a higher high than the left shoulder by a significant  enough margin to be clearly evident on the price chart  Volume is typically lower in this  rally however than in the one that formed the first upward side of the left shoulder  This  second rally also fails with price falling back to the same level at which the left shoulder  began and ended  This price level is called the neckline  This price level also will be  below the uptrend line formed by connecting the low prices in the uptrend preceding the  beginning of the head and shoulders pattern  This head pattern is the first signal that the  rally may be coming to an end and that a reversal may be starting

2,745,  Right shoulder  The right shoulder is a mirror image  or close to a mirror image  of the  left shoulder but on lower volume signifying less buying enthusiasm  The price rallies up  to roughly the same level as the first shoulder but the rally reverses at a lower high price  than the rally that formed the head

2,746,Rarely will an analyst see a perfectly formed head and shoulders pattern  variations include two  tops on the shoulders or on the head  The head however should rise to a higher price level than  either shoulder whereas the shoulders should be roughly symmetrical  In terms of the neckline  price level the first rally should begin at this level and the left shoulder and head should also  decline to roughly this level  But necklines may not always form exactly horizontal lines  These  imperfect variations make this  and other  technical patterns difficult for quantitative analysts or  academicians to model but the human brain can detect the pattern even if it is imperfectly  formed 
3,746,Volume is important in analyzing head and shoulders patterns  A new high in price at the top of  the head without a new high in volume signals fewer bullish market participants  When one  indicator is making a new high  or low  but another is not this situation is called divergence   In divergence the right shoulder will have even lower volume signaling that buying interest or  demand is tapering off and will soon be overwhelmed by supply  The result will be a price  decline 
4,746,Once the head and shoulders pattern has formed the expectation is that the share price will  decline down through the neckline price  Technicians tend to use filtering rules to make sure  that a clear breakdown of the neckline has occurred  These rules may take the form of waiting  to trade until the price falls to a meaningful level below the neckline    percent or   percent are  commonly used  and or a time limit for the price to remain below the neckline before trading   when a daily price chart is used the rule may be several days to a week  Prices commonly  rebound to the neckline levels even after a decline has exceeded the filter levels  Prices  generally stop however at or around the neckline  The neckline was a support level and under  the change in polarity principle once a support level is breached it becomes a resistance level

2,747,         Inverse Head and Shoulders
3,747,The head and shoulders pattern can also form upside down and act as a reversal pattern for a  preceding downtrend  The three parts of the inverse head and shoulders are as follows 
4,747,  Left shoulder  This shoulder appears to show a strong decline with the slope of the  decline greater than the prior downtrend on strong volume  The rally then reverses back  to the price level where it started forming a V pattern but on lower volume 
5,747,  Head  The head is a more pronounced version of the left shoulder  Another decline  follows but on diminishing volume which takes the price to a lower low than the prior  shoulder by a significant enough margin that it is clearly evident on the price chart  This  second decline also reverses with price rising to the same level at which the left shoulder  began and ended  This price level the neckline will also be above the downtrend line  formed by connecting the high prices in the downtrend preceding the beginning of the  inverse head and shoulders pattern  This pattern is the first signal that the decline may be  coming to an end and that a reversal may be near 
6,747,  Right shoulder  The right shoulder is roughly a mirror image of the left shoulder but on  lower volume signifying less selling enthusiasm  The price declines down to roughly the  same level as the first shoulder but the rally reverses at a higher low price than the rally  that formed the head 
7,747,         Setting Price Targets with Head and Shoulders Pattern
8,747,As with all technical patterns the head and shoulders pattern must be analyzed from the  perspective of the security s long term price trend  The rally that happened before the formation  of the pattern must be large enough for there to be something to reverse  The stronger and more  pronounced the rally was the stronger and more pronounced the reversal is likely to be   Similarly once the neckline is breached the security is expected to decline by the same amount  as the change in price from the neckline to the top of the head  If the preceding rally started at a  price higher than the neckline however the correction is unlikely to bring the price lower than  the price level at the start of the rally  Because a head and shoulders formation is a bearish  indicator  i e  a technician would expect the previously established uptrend to end and a  downtrend to commence  a technician would seek to profit by shorting the security under  analysis  When attempting to profit from the head and shoulders pattern a technician will often  use the price differences between the head and the neckline to set a price target which is the  price at which the technician anticipates closing the investment position  The price target for the  head and shoulders pattern is calculated as follows 
9,747,Price target   Neckline    Head   Neckline 
10,747,For example in Exhibit    the high price reached at the top of the head is roughly     and the  neckline formed at roughly     for a difference of      So a technician would expect the price  to decline to a level     below the neckline or to      that is

4,748,Danielle Waterhouse is the technical analyst at Kanektok Securities  One of the  companies her firm follows is LPA Petroleum  Waterhouse believes that a graph of  LPA s share prices over the past six months reveals a classic head and shoulders pattern   The share price peaked at US     and she estimates the neckline at US     At today s  close the shares traded at US     Based on the head and shoulders pattern what price  target should Waterhouse estimate 
5,748,Solution 
6,748,Waterhouse estimates the neckline at US    which is US     minus US    or US     lower than the head  Her price target is thus US    minus US    which is US      Waterhouse would attempt to sell LPA short at today s price of US    and anticipate  closing the position at US    for a profit of US    per share  not accounting for  transaction costs  
7,748,         Setting Price Targets with Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern
8,748,Calculating price targets for inverse head and shoulders patterns is similar to the process for  head and shoulders patterns but in this case because the pattern predicts the end of a  downtrend the technician calculates how high the price is expected to rise once it breaches the  neckline  Exhibit    illustrates an inverse head and shoulders pattern

4,749,Price target   Neckline    Neckline   Head 
5,749,For example in the price chart in Exhibit    the low price reached at the bottom of the head is  roughly US      and the neckline formed at roughly US       The target can thus be found  as                                  In this case a technician might have taken a long  position in the summer of      with the hope of eventually exiting the position at about  US       for a profit 
6,749,         Double Tops and Bottoms
7,749,A double top is when an uptrend reverses twice at roughly the same high price level   Typically volume is lower on the second high than on the first high signaling a diminishing of  demand  The longer the time is between the two tops and the deeper the sell off is after the first  top the more significant the pattern is considered to be  Price targets can be calculated from this  pattern in a manner similar to the calculation for the head and shoulders pattern  For a double  top price is expected to decline below the low of the valley between the two tops by at least the  distance from the valley low to the high of the double tops

3,750,Richard Dupuis is a technician who trades Eurodollar futures for his own account  He  analyzes charts based on one minute time intervals looking for short term trading  opportunities  Eurodollar futures contracts have been trending upward most of the  morning but Dupuis now observes what he believes is a double top pattern  After  peaking at US       the futures contract price fell to US       climbed again to  US       and then started a decline  Because of the double top Dupuis anticipates a  reversal from the uptrend to a downtrend  Dupuis decides to open a short position to  capitalize on the anticipated trend reversal  What price target should Dupuis estimate for  closing the position 
4,750,Solution 
5,750,Dupuis estimates the price target as                                     
6,750,Double bottoms are formed when the price reaches a low rebounds and then sells off back to  the first low level  Exhibit    depicts a double bottom pattern for Time Warner  Technicians  use the double bottom to predict a change from a downtrend to an uptrend in security prices   For double bottoms the price is expected to appreciate above the peak between the two bottoms  by at least the distance from the valley lows to the peak

2,751,The reason these patterns are significant is that they show that at some price point investors  step in to reverse trends that are under way  For an uptrend a double top implies that at some  price point enough traders are willing to either sell positions  or enter new short positions  that  their activities overwhelm and reverse the uptrend created by demand for the shares  A  reasonable conclusion is that this price level has been fundamentally derived and that it  represents the intrinsic value of the security that is the consensus of investors  With double  bottoms if a security ceases to decline at the same price point on two separate occasions the  analyst can conclude that the market consensus is that at that price point the security is now  cheap enough that it is an attractive investment 
3,751,         Triple Tops and Bottoms
4,751,Triple tops consist of three peaks at roughly the same price level and triple bottoms consist  of three troughs at roughly the same price level  A triple top for Rockwell Automation during       is shown in Exhibit

6,751,One of the challenges in double top and triple top patterns and one of the valid criticisms of  technical analysis in general is that an analyst cannot know which pattern will result until after  the fact  For example after the broad equity market sell off in the first quarter of      a  number of investment professionals were quoted as calling for a  retest of the lows  in  technical terms a double bottom

2,752,There is no evidence that market corrections  or rallies  must end with a double bottom  or  double top in the case of an uptrend  and there is no generally accepted technical theory that  predicts whether a low will be repeated once or even twice before a reversal occurs  A double  bottom is considered to be a more significant pattern than a single bottom because traders have  stepped in on two occasions to halt declines  However traders have no way to determine  whether a double top or bottom will be followed by a third top or bottom  Triple tops and triple  bottoms are rare but when they occur they are more significant reversal patterns than double  tops or double bottoms  On three separate occasions traders stepped in to sell or buy shares  with enough volume to end a rally or decline under way at the time  Nevertheless the greater  the number of times the price reverses at the same level and the greater the time interval over  which this pattern occurs the greater the significance of the pattern 
3,752,       Continuation Patterns
4,752,A continuation pattern is used to predict the resumption of a market trend that was in place  prior to the formation of a pattern  From a supply and demand standpoint a continuation  pattern indicates a change in ownership from one group of investors to another  For example if  a positive trend was in place prior to a pattern and then one group of investors begins selling  the negative impact on price is quickly offset by other investors buying so the forces of supply  and demand go back and forth in terms of their impact on price  But neither has an  overwhelming advantage  This type of pattern is often called  a healthy correction  because the  long term market trend does not change and because while one set of investors is seeking to  exit they are replaced by another set of investors willing to take their positions at roughly the  same share price 
5,752,         Triangles
6,752,Triangle patterns are a type of continuation pattern  They come in three forms symmetrical  triangles ascending triangles and descending triangles  A triangle pattern forms as the range  between high and low prices narrows visually forming a triangle  In old terminology triangles  were referred to as  coils   which was also synonymous with  springs   because a triangle was  considered analogous to a spring being wound up tighter and tighter and storing energy that  would at some point be released  In a triangle a trendline connects the highs and a trendline  connects the lows  As the distance between the highs and lows narrows the trendlines meet  forming a triangle  In a daily price chart a triangle pattern usually forms over a period of  several weeks 
7,752,In an ascending triangle as shown in Exhibit    the trendline connecting the high prices is  horizontal and the trendline connecting the low prices forms an uptrend  What this pattern  means is that market participants are selling the stock at the same price level over a period of  time putting a halt to rallies at the same price point but that buyers are getting more and more  bullish and stepping in at increasingly higher prices to halt sell offs instead of waiting for  further price declines  An ascending triangle typically forms in an uptrend  The horizontal line  represents sellers taking profits at around the same price point presumably because they believe  that this price represents the fundamental intrinsic value of the security  The fact that the rally  continues beyond the triangle may be a bullish signal  it means that another set of investors is  presumably willing to buy at an even higher price because their analysis suggests the intrinsic  value of the security is higher  Alternatively the fundamental facts themselves may have  changed  that is the security s fundamental value may be increasing over time  The technician  does not care which explanation is true  the technician is relying solely on the information  conveyed by the security price itself not the underlying reason

3,753,Exhibit     Ascending Triangle Pattern
4,753,In the descending triangle shown in Exhibit    the low prices form a horizontal trendline and  the high prices form a series of lower and lower highs  Typically a descending triangle will  form in a downtrend  At some point in the sell offs buyers appear with enough demand to halt  sell offs each time they occur at around the same price  Again this phenomenon may be the  result of fundamental analysts believing that the security has reached a price where it represents  a significant discount to its intrinsic value and these analysts step in and buy  As the triangle  forms each rally ceases at a lower and lower high price point suggesting the selling demand is  exerting greater price influence than buying demand

2,754,In a symmetrical triangle the trendline formed by the highs angles down and the trendline  formed by the lows angles up both at roughly the same angle forming a symmetrical pattern   Exhibit    contains a symmetrical triangle formed by the price for Transocean in early        What this triangle indicates is that buyers are becoming more bullish while simultaneously  sellers are becoming more bearish so they are moving toward a point of consensus  Because the  sellers are often dominated by long investors exiting positions  as opposed to short sellers  creating new short positions  the pressure to sell diminishes once the sellers have sold the  security  Thus the pattern ends in the same direction as the trend that preceded it either uptrend  or downtrend

3,755,The term  measuring implication  refers to the height of a triangle as illustrated with a dark  vertical bar in Exhibit     The measuring implication is derived by calculating the difference in  price from the two trendlines at the start of the triangle  Once the pattern is broken and the price  breaks through one of the trendlines that form the triangle the analyst expects the price to move  by at least the amount of the breakthrough above or below the trendline  Typically price breaks  out of a triangle pattern between halfway and three quarters of the way through the pattern  The  longer the triangle pattern persists the more volatile and sustained the subsequent price  movement is likely to be 
4,755,         Rectangle Pattern
5,755,A rectangle pattern is a continuation pattern formed by two parallel trendlines one formed by  connecting the high prices during the pattern and the other formed by the lows  Exhibit    shows two rectangle patterns  As is the case with other patterns the rectangle pattern is a  graphical representation of what has been occurring in terms of collective market sentiment   The horizontal resistance line that forms the top of the rectangle shows that investors are  repeatedly selling shares at a specific price level bringing rallies to an end  The horizontal  support line forming the bottom of the rectangle indicates that traders are repeatedly making  large enough purchases at the same price level to reverse declines  The support level in a bullish  rectangle is natural because the long term trend in the market is bullish  The resistance line may  simply represent investors taking profits  Conversely in a bearish rectangle the support level  may represent investors buying the security  Again the technician is not concerned with why a  pattern has formed only with the likely next price movement once the price breaks out of the  pattern

3,756,         Flags and Pennants
4,756,Flags and pennants are considered minor continuation patterns because they form over short  periods of time on a daily price chart typically over a week  They are similar to each other  and have the same uses  A flag is formed by parallel trendlines in the same way that most  countries  flags are rectangular and create a parallelogram  Typically the trendlines slope in a  direction opposite to the trend up to that time  for example in an uptrend they slope down  A  pennant formation is similar except that the trendlines converge to form a triangle similar to the  pennants of many sports teams or pennants flown on ships  The key difference between a  triangle and pennant is that a pennant is a short term formation whereas a triangle is a long term  formation 
5,756,The expectation for both flags and pennants is that the trend will continue after the pattern in  the same direction it was going prior to the pattern  The price is expected to change by at least  the same amount as the price change from the start of the trend to the formation of the flag or  pennant  In Exhibit    a downtrend begins at point A which is       At point B which is      a pennant begins to form  The distance from point A to point B is      The pennant ends at  point C which is      The price target is     minus     which is     the line labeled D

3,757,     Technical Indicators
4,757,The technical analyst uses a variety of technical indicators to supplement the information  gleaned from charts  A technical indicator is any measure based on price market sentiment or  funds flow that can be used to predict changes in price  These indicators often have a supply  and demand underpinning  that is they measure how potential changes in supply and demand  might affect a security s price 
5,757,       Price Based Indicators
6,757,Price based indicators somehow incorporate information contained in the current and past  history of market prices  Indicators of this type range from simple  e g  a moving average  to  complex  e g  a stochastic oscillator  
7,757,         Moving Average
8,757,A moving average is the average of the closing price of a security over a specified number of  periods  Moving averages smooth out short term price fluctuations giving the technician a  clearer image of market trend  Technicians commonly use a simple moving average which  weights each price equally in the calculation of the average price  Some technicians prefer to  use an exponential moving average  also called an exponentially smoothed moving average   which gives the greatest weight to recent prices while giving exponentially less weight to older  prices

2,758,The number of data points included in the moving average depends on the intended use of the  moving average  A    day moving average is commonly used because a month contains  roughly    trading days  Also    days is commonly used because it represents a quarter year   three months  of trading activity 
3,758,Moving averages can be used in conjunction with a price trend or in conjunction with one  another  Moving averages are also used to determine support and resistance 
4,758,Because a moving average is less volatile than price this tool can be used in several ways  First  whether price is above or below its moving average is important  A security that has been  trending down in price will trade below its moving average and a security that has been  trending up will trade above its moving average  Second the distance between the moving  average line and price is also significant  Once price begins to move back up toward its moving  average line this line can serve as a resistance level  The    day moving average line is  commonly cited in the press and when the price approaches the moving average line many  investors become concerned that a rally will stall so they sell the security 
5,758,Two or more moving averages can be used in conjunction  Exhibit    shows the price chart of  Gazprom SP European Depositary Receipts  EDRs  on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange overlaid  with    day and    day EDR moving averages for late      to mid        Note that the longer  the time frame used in the creation of a moving average the smoother and less volatile the line   Investors often use moving average crossovers as a buy or sell signal  When a short term  moving average crosses from underneath a longer term average this movement is considered  bullish and is termed a golden cross  Conversely when a short term moving average crosses  from above a longer term moving average this movement is considered bearish and is called a  dead cross  In the case shown in Exhibit    a trading strategy of buying on golden crosses  and selling on dead crosses would have been profitable

2,759,Moving averages are easy to construct and simple trading rules can be derived for using them   Computers can optimize what time lengths to set when using two moving averages  This  optimization may take the form of changing the number of days included in each moving  average or adding filter rules such as waiting several days after a trade signal is given to make  a trade  Reasons for optimization include the desire to manage capital drawdowns to maximize  gains or to minimize losses  Once the moving average is optimized even if a profitable trading  system is devised for that security the strategy is unlikely to work for other securities  especially if they are dissimilar  Also as market conditions change a previously optimized  trading system may no longer work 
3,759,         Bollinger Bands
4,759,Market veteran John Bollinger combined his knowledge of technical analysis with his  knowledge of statistics to create an indicator called Bollinger Bands  Bollinger Bands consist  of a moving average plus a higher line representing the moving average plus a set number of  standard deviations from average price  for the same number of periods as used to calculate the  moving average  and a lower line that is a moving average minus the same number of standard  deviations  Exhibit    depicts Bollinger Bands for the Gazprom EDR

2,760,The more volatile the security being analyzed becomes the wider the range becomes between  the two outer lines or bands  Similar to moving averages Bollinger Bands can be used to create  trading strategies that can be easily computerized and tested  A common use is as a contrarian  strategy in which the investor sells when a security price reaches the upper band and buys  when it reaches the lower band  This strategy assumes that the security price will stay within the  bands 
3,760,This type of strategy is likely to lead to a large number of trades but it also limits risk because  the trader can quickly exit unprofitable trades  In the event of a sharp price move and a change  in trend however a contrarian strategy based on Bollinger Bands would be unprofitable  So  long term investors might actually buy on a significant breakout above the upper boundary  band because a major breakout would imply a change in trend likely to persist for some time   The long term investor would sell on a significant breakout below the lower band  In this  strategy significance would be defined as breaking above or below the band by a certain  percentage  say   percent or    percent  and or for a certain period of time  say a week for a  daily price chart   Again such rules can easily be computerized and tested 
4,760,       Momentum Oscillators
5,760,One of the key challenges in using indicators overlaid on a price chart is the difficulty of  discerning changes in market sentiment that are out of the ordinary  Momentum oscillators are intended to alleviate this problem  They are constructed from price data but they are  calculated so that they either oscillate between a high and low  typically   and      or oscillate  around a number  such as   or       Because of this construction extreme highs or lows are  easily discernible  These extremes can be viewed as graphic representations of market sentiment  when selling or buying activity is more aggressive than historically typical  Because they are  price based momentum oscillators also can be analyzed by using the same tools technicians use  to analyze price such as the concepts of trend support and resistance 
6,760,Technicians also look for convergence or divergence between oscillators and price   Convergence is when the oscillator moves in the same manner as the security being analyzed  and divergence is when the oscillator moves differently from the security  For example when  price reaches a new high this sign is considered bullish but if the momentum oscillator being  used does not also reach a new high at the same time this pattern is divergence  It is considered  to be an early warning of weakness an indication that the uptrend may soon end 
7,760,Momentum oscillators should be used in conjunction with an understanding of the existing  market  price  trend  Oscillators alert a trader to overbought or oversold conditions  In an  overbought condition market sentiment is unsustainably bullish  In an oversold condition  market sentiment is unsustainably bearish  In other words the oscillator range must be  considered separately for every security  Some securities may experience wide variations and  others may experience only minor variations 
8,760,Oscillators have three main uses  First oscillators can be used to determine the strength of a  trend  Extreme overbought levels are warning signals for uptrends and extreme oversold levels  are warning signals for downtrends  Second when oscillators reach historically high or low  levels they may be signaling a pending trend reversal  For oscillators that move above and  below   crossing the   level signals a change in the direction of the trend  For oscillators that  move above and below     crossing the     level signals a change in the direction of the trend   Third in a non trending market oscillators can be used for short term trading decisions that  is to sell at overbought levels and to buy at oversold levels

2,761,         Momentum or Rate of Change Oscillator
3,761,The terms momentum oscillator and rate of change oscillator are synonymous   Rate of  change  is often abbreviated ROC  The ROC oscillator is calculated by taking the most recent  closing price subtracting the closing price from a prior date that is a set number of days in the  past and multiplying the result by     
4,761,M    V   Vx       
5,761,where
6,761,M   momentum oscillator value
7,761,V   last closing price
8,761,Vx   closing price x days ago typically    days
9,761,When the ROC oscillator crosses zero in the same direction as the direction of the trend this  movement is considered a buy or sell signal  For example if the ROC oscillator crosses into  positive territory during an uptrend it is a buy signal  If it enters into negative territory during a  downtrend it is considered a sell signal  The technician will ignore crossovers in opposition to  the trend because the technician must always first take into account the general trend when  using oscillators 
10,761,An alternative method of constructing this oscillator is to set it so that it oscillates above and  below     instead of   as follows

3,762,In Exhibit    the calculation method for the ROC oscillator for Toyota stock traded on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange is for the oscillator to move around     and x is    days  Note that for  this stock the ROC oscillator tends to maintain a range between     and       So episodes  when the oscillator moves outside this range are of particular interest to the technician  An  extreme high means that the stock has posted its highest gain in any    day period at this point  and an extreme low reading means it has posted its greatest loss over any    day period  When  investors bid up the price of a security too rapidly the indication is that sentiment may be  unduly bullish and the market may be overbought  Exhibit    shows that overbought levels of  the ROC oscillator coincide with temporary highs in the stock price  So those levels would  have been signals to sell the stock  The other notable aspect of Exhibit    is the divergence  when the share price hit a new low in December      but the ROC oscillator did not  This  divergence would have been a bullish signal and would have been interpreted to mean that  although the share price hit a new low investor sentiment was actually higher than it had been  previously  In itself this information would not have been enough to warrant buying the shares  because a downtrend in price was still in place but it alerted the technician to the fact that the  trend might end soon  The technician could then look for further indication of the trend s end  and with confirmation might buy the stock

2,763,         Relative Strength Index
3,763,A relative strength index  RSI  is computed over a rolling time period   It graphically  compares a security s gains with its losses over the set period  The creator of the RSI Welles  Wilder suggested a    day time period and this period is generally the period used in most  technical analysis software  The technician should understand that this variable can be changed  and that the optimal time range should be determined by how the technician intends to use the  RSI information  Factors that influence selection of the time period are similar to those that  influence the selection of a time period for moving averages  Short time periods  such as     days  provide information about short term price behavior  If     days is used this short term  information will be smoothed out and perhaps will not be apparent at all 
4,763,RSI is a momentum oscillator and is not to be confused with the charting method called   relative strength analysis  in which the ratio of two security prices is plotted over time  The  RSI provides information on whether or not an asset is overbought  The formula for the RSI is  not intuitive and is best understood with an example  The formula is

12,764,The index construction forces the RSI to lie within   and      A value above    represents an  overbought situation  Values below    suggest the asset is oversold  Again as is the case with  most technical tools an analyst cannot simply learn the default settings and use them in every  case  The       range is a good rule of thumb but because the oscillator is a measure of  volatility less volatile stocks  such as utilities  may normally trade in a much narrower range   More volatile stocks  such as small capitalization technology stocks  may trade in a wider  range  The range also does not have to be symmetrical around     For example in an uptrend  one might see a range of       but in downtrends a range of       
13,764,The RSI measure often appears at the bottom or top of a price chart  Exhibit    shows a  candlestick chart of Ford stock in      with the corresponding RSI

2,765,The candlestick chart of Ford stock prices in Exhibit    illustrates several aspects of the use of  an RSI  For example because the RSI oscillator was higher than    on    March so the stock  was overbought at that time a simple reading of the chart might have led to the conclusion that  the trader should sell the stock  Doing so however would have caused the trader to miss a  significant advance in the shares  A more careful technical analysis that took into account the  trend would have indicated that the stock was in an uptrend so RSI readings above    could be  expected 
3,765,Because RSI is a price based oscillator the trader can also apply trend lines to analyze it  Note  in Exhibit    that both the share price and the RSI oscillator were in uptrends from February  until April but that the RSI uptrend was broken on    April a potential warning that the uptrend  in price might also break downward  In June the share price broke its uptrend support line 
4,765,         Stochastic Oscillator
5,765,The stochastic oscillator is based on the observation that in uptrends prices tend to close at or  near the high end of their recent range and in downtrends they tend to close near the low end   The logic behind these patterns is that if the shares of a stock are constantly being bid up during  the day but then lose value by the close continuation of the rally is doubtful  If sellers have  enough supply to overwhelm buyers the rally is suspect  If a stock rallies during the day and is  able to hold on to some or most of those gains by the close that sign is bullish 
6,765,The stochastic oscillator oscillates between   and     and has a default setting of a    day  period which again might be adjusted for the situation as we discussed for the RSI  The  oscillator is composed of two lines called  K and  D that are calculated as follows 
7,765,  K        
8,765,C   L   H     L

2,766,C   latest closing price
3,766,L     lowest price in past    days
4,766,H     highest price in past    days
5,766, D   average of the last three  K values calculated daily
6,766,Analysts should think about the  D in the same way they would a long term moving average  line in conjunction with a short term line  That is  D because it is the average of three  K  values is the slower moving smoother line and is called the signal line  And  K is the faster  moving line  The  K value means that the latest closing price  C  was in the  K percentile of  the high low range  L   to H    
7,766,The default oversold overbought range for the stochastic oscillator is based on reading the  signal line relative to readings of    and    but warnings about always using the default range  for the RSI oscillator also apply in the case of the stochastic oscillator  In fact noted technician  Constance Brown has coined a term called the  stochastics default club  to refer to neophyte  technicians who trade based solely on these defaults   She has reported being able to develop  successful trading strategies by using a time frame shorter than the    day default to calculate  the stochastic oscillator  Apparently enough traders are basing trades on the defaults to move  the market for certain stocks  So using shorter time frames than the default she could trade  ahead of the traders in the default stochastic club and generate a profit  Of course other traders  might be tempted to use an even shorter time frame but there is a drawback to using a short  time frame  namely the shorter the time frame is the more volatile the oscillator becomes and  the more false signals it generates 
8,766,The stochastic oscillator should be used with other technical tools such as trend analysis or  pattern analysis  If both methods suggest the same conclusion the trader has convergence  or  confirmation  but if they give conflicting signals the trader has divergence which is a warning  signal suggesting that further analysis is necessary 
9,766,The absolute level of the two lines should be considered in light of their normal range   Movements above this range indicate to a technician an overbought security and are considered  bearish  movements below this range indicate an oversold security and are considered bullish   Crossovers of the two lines can also give trading signals the same way crossovers of two  moving averages give signals  When the  K moves from below the  D line to above it this  move is considered a bullish short term trading signal  conversely when  K moves from above  the  D line to below it this pattern is considered bearish  In practice a trader can use technical  analysis software to adjust trading rules and optimize the calculation of the stochastic oscillator  for a particular security and investment purpose  e g  short term trading or long term  investing  
10,766,The reason technicians use historical data to test their trading rules and find the optimal  parameters for each security is that each security is different  The group of market participants  actively trading differs from security to security  Just as each person has a different personality  so do groups of people  In effect the groups of active market participants trading each security  are imparting their personality on the trading activity for that security  As this group changes  over time the ideal parameters for a particular security may change

2,767,Exhibit    provides a good example of how the stochastic oscillator can be used together with  trend analysis  The exhibit provides the weekly price chart and stochastic oscillator for Petroleo  Brasileiro ADRs which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange for June      through  June       Note that during the downtrend on the left side of the chart the stochastic oscillator  often moved below     Each time it reached    however it provided a valid sell signal  When  the downtrend ended in November      and an uptrend began the stochastic oscillator was  regularly moving above    but each time the  K line moved above  D a valid buy signal was  given

4,767,         Moving Average Convergence Divergence Oscillator
5,767,The moving average convergence divergence oscillator is commonly referred to as
6,767,MACD which is pronounced Mack Dee  The MACD is the difference between a short term  and a long term moving average of the security s price  The MACD is constructed by  calculating two lines the MACD line and the signal line 
7,767,  MACD line  difference between two exponentially smoothed moving averages generally     and    days

2,768,The indicator oscillates around zero and has no upper or lower limit  Rather than using a set  overbought oversold range for MACD the analyst compares the current level with the  historical performance of the oscillator for a particular security to determine when a security is  out of its normal sentiment range 
3,768,MACD is used in technical analysis in three ways  The first is to note crossovers of the MACD  line and the signal line as discussed for moving averages and the stochastic oscillator   Crossovers of the two lines may indicate a change in trend  The second is to look for times  when the MACD is outside its normal range for a given security  The third is to use trend lines  on the MACD itself  When the MACD is trending in the same direction as price this pattern is  convergence and when the two are trending in opposite directions the pattern is divergence 
4,768,Exhibit    shows a daily price chart of Exxon Mobil  at the top  with the MACD oscillator for  March through October of       Note the convergence in the bottoming of both the oscillator  and price in May which provided confirmation of a change in trend  This change was further  confirmed by the MACD line crossing above the signal line  A bearish signal was given in  September with the change in trend of both price and the oscillator and the crossover of the  signal line by the MACD line  The fact that the MACD oscillator was moving up to a level that  was unusually high for this stock would have been an early warning signal in September

6,768,       Sentiment Indicators
7,768,Sentiment indicators attempt to gauge investor activity for signs of increasing bullishness or  bearishness  Sentiment indicators come in two forms investor polls and calculated statistical  indexes

2,769,         Opinion Polls
3,769,A wide range of services conduct periodic polls of either individual investors or investment  professionals to gauge their sentiment about the equity market  The most common of the polls  are the Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment reports Market Vane Bullish Consensus  Consensus Bullish Sentiment Index and Daily Sentiment Index all of which poll investment  professionals and reports of the American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  which  polls individual investors  All but the AAII survey are subscription based services  Barron s magazine publishes data from four of these surveys on a weekly basis 
4,769,By regularly polling compiling these data over time and presenting it graphically these  services provide technicians with an analyzable snapshot of investor sentiment over time   Technicians look at prior market activity and compare it with highs or lows in sentiment as  well as inflection points in sentiment as a gauge when they are forecasting the future direction  of the market 
5,769,The most widely used investor polls are all US based  One reason is that interpretation of the  surveys is determined by comparing the survey results with market performance over time  To  gauge a survey s usefulness in predicting major market turns the survey must have been  published over several cycles and each of the surveys mentioned here based on US data has  been available for several decades 
6,769,         Calculated Statistical Indexes
7,769,The other category of sentiment indicators are indicators that are calculated from market data  such as security prices  The two most commonly used are derived from the options market  they  are the put call ratio and the volatility index  Additionally many analysts look at margin debt  and short interest 
8,769,The put call ratio is the volume of put options traded divided by the volume of call options  traded for a particular financial instrument  Investors who buy put options on a security are  presumably bearish and investors who buy call options are presumably bullish  The volume in  call options is greater than the volume traded in put options over time so the put call ratio is  normally below      The ratio is considered to be a contrarian indicator meaning that higher  values are considered bearish and lower values are considered bullish  But its usefulness as a  contrarian indicator is limited except at extreme low or high levels in relation to the historical  trading level of the put call ratio for a particular financial instrument  The actual value of the  put call ratio and its normal range differs for each security or market so no standard  definitions of overbought or oversold levels exist  At extreme lows where call option volume is  significantly greater than put option volume market sentiment is said to be so overly positive  that a correction is likely  At extreme highs in the put call ratio market sentiment is said to be  so extremely negative that an increase in price is likely 
9,769,The CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  is a measure of near term market volatility calculated by the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  Since      it has been calculated from option prices on the  stocks in the S P      The VIX rises when market participants become fearful of an impending  market decline  These participants then bid up the price of puts and the result is an increase in  the VIX level  Technicians use the VIX in conjunction with trend pattern or oscillator tools  and it is interpreted from a contrarian perspective  When other indicators suggest that the  market is oversold and the VIX is at an extreme high this combination is considered bullish   Exhibit    shows the VIX from March      to December

3,770,Margin debt is also often used as an indication of sentiment  As a group investors have a  history of buying near market tops and selling at the bottom  When the market is rising and  indexes reach new highs investors are motivated to buy more equities in the hope of  participating in the market rally  A margin account permits an investor to borrow part of the  investment cost from the brokerage firm  This debt magnifies the gains or losses resulting from  the investment 
4,770,Investor psychology plays an important role in the intuition behind margin debt as an indicator   When stock margin debt is increasing investors are aggressively buying and stock prices will  move higher because of increased demand  Eventually the margin traders use all of their  available credit so their buying power  and therefore demand  decreases which fuels a price  decline  Falling prices may trigger margin calls and forced selling thereby driving prices even  lower 
5,770,Brokerage firms must report activity in their customers  margin accounts so keeping track of  borrowing behavior is relatively easy  Exhibit    provides a    year comparison of margin debt  with the S P      The correlation is striking  Rising margin debt is generally associated with a  rising index level and falling margin debt is associated with a falling index level  In fact for the      months shown in Exhibit    the correlation coefficient between the levels of margin debt  and the S P     is      percent  When margin debt peaked in the summer of      the market  also topped out  Margin debt dropped sharply during the latter part of      as the subprime  crisis took the market down  Investors began to use borrowed funds again in the first half of       when heavily discounted shares became increasingly attractive  Margin debt was still well  below the average of the last decade but the upturn would be viewed as a bullish sign by  advocates of this indicator

4,771,Short interest is another commonly used sentiment indicator  Investors sell shares short when  they believe the share prices will decline  Brokerage firms must report short sale activity and  these statistics are aggregated and reported by the exchanges and the financial press on a  monthly basis  The number of shares of a particular security that are currently sold short is  called  short interest   The short interest ratio represents the number of days of trading activity  represented by short interest  To facilitate comparisons of large and small companies common  practice is to  normalize  this value by dividing short interest by average daily trading volume  to get the short interest ratio 
5,771,Short interest ratio   Short interest Average daily trading volume

2,772,Solution 
3,772,The short interest ratio for Goldman Sachs was          divided by         or      days  For TD Bank the short interest ratio was          divided by         or        days 
4,772,There are differences of opinion about how to interpret short interest as an indicator  It is  considered to show market sentiment and to be a contrarian indicator  Some people believe that  if a large number of shares are sold short and the short interest ratio is high the market should  expect a falling price for the shares because of so much negative sentiment about them  A  counter argument is that although the short sellers are bearish on the security the effect of their  short sales has already been felt in the security price  The short sellers  next action will be to  buy shares back to cover their short positions  When the short sellers cover their positions those  actions will provide a boost to the share price  Therefore the short interest ratio constitutes  future  and known  demand for the shares 
5,772,Regardless of the analyst s perspective in Example   the TD Bank short interest ratio of  approximately    is more noteworthy than the much lower figure for Goldman Sachs 
6,772,       Flow of Funds Indicators
7,772,Technicians look at fund flows as a way to gauge the potential supply and demand for equities   Demand can come in the form of margin borrowing against current holdings or cash holdings  by mutual funds and other groups that are normally large holders of equities such as insurance  companies and pension funds  The more cash these groups hold the more bullish is the  indication for equities  One caveat in looking at potential sources of demand is that although  these data indicate the potential buying power of various large investor groups the data say  nothing about the likelihood that the groups will buy 
8,772,On the supply side technicians look at new or secondary issuance of stock because these  activities put more securities into the market and increase supply 
9,772,         Arms Index
10,772,A common flow of funds indicator is the Arms Index also called the TRIN  for  short term  trading index     This indicator is applied to a broad market  such as the S P      to measure  the relative extent to which money is moving into or out of rising and declining stocks  The  index is a ratio of two ratios

14,774,         Margin Debt
15,774,The previous section discussed the use of margin debt as an indicator of market sentiment   Margin debt is also widely used as a flow of funds indicator because margin loans may increase  the purchases of stocks and declining margin balances may force the selling of stocks 
16,774,         Mutual Fund Cash Position
17,774,Mutual funds hold a substantial proportion of all investable assets  Some analysts use the  percentage of mutual fund assets held in cash as a predictor of market direction  It is called the   mutual fund cash position indicator   Mutual funds must hold some of their assets in cash in  order to pay bills and send redemption checks to account holders  Cash arrives on a daily basis  from customer deposits interest earned and dividends received  Cash also increases after a  fund manager sells a position and holds the funds before reinvesting them  During a bull  market the manager wants to buy shares as quickly as possible to avoid having a cash  drag   hurt the fund s performance  If prices are trending lower however the manager may hold funds  in cash to improve the fund s performance 
18,774,Exhibit    shows year end mutual fund cash in the United States as a percentage of assets from       through       Over this period the average cash percentage was     percent  An analyst s  initial intuition might be that when cash is relatively low fund managers are bullish and  anticipate rising prices but when fund managers are bearish they conserve cash to wait for  lower prices  Advocates of this technical indicator argue exactly the opposite  When the mutual  fund cash position is low fund managers have already bought and the effects of their purchases  are already reflected in security prices  When the cash position is high however that money  represents buying power that will move prices higher when the money is used to add positions  to the portfolio  The mutual fund cash position is another example of a contrarian indicator

3,775,Some analysts modify the value of the cash percentage to account for differences in the level of  interest rates  Cash is not sitting in a desk drawer  it is on deposit somewhere earning interest   When interest rates are low holding cash can be a substantial drag on the fund s performance if  the broad market advances  When interest rates are high holding cash is less costly

8,776,Of the four indicators one is bullish one is bearish and two are neutral  Most analysts  would view this result as  net neutral  and would recommend continuing to hold the  stock  An alternative point of view might be that seeing a bullish indicator for the stock  while the indicator for the overall market is bearish could be an argument for  overweighting the stock 
9,776,         New Equity Issuance
10,776,When a company s owners decide to take a company public and offer shares for sale the  owners want to put those shares on the market at a time when investors are eager to buy  That  is the owners want to offer the shares when they can sell them at a premium price  Premium  prices occur near market tops  The new equity issuance indicator suggests that as the number of  initial public offerings  IPOs  increases the upward price trend may be about to turn down 
11,776,A supply and demand effect is also at work  Putting more shares on the market increases the  aggregate supply of shares available for investors to purchase  The investment community has a  finite quantity of cash to spend so an increase in IPOs may be viewed as a bearish factor 
12,776,         Secondary Offerings
13,776,Technicians also monitor secondary offerings to gauge potential changes in the supply of  equities  Although secondary offerings do not increase the supply of shares because existing  shares are sold by insiders to the general public they do increase the supply available for  trading or the float  So from a market perspective secondary offerings of shares have the  potential to change the supply and demand equation as much as IPOs do

2,777,     Cycles
3,777,Over the centuries technicians have noted recurring cycles of various frequencies in the capital  markets  The study of cycles in the markets is part of broader cycle studies that exist in  numerous fields of study  Many observed cycles such as one in US equities tied to the cycle of  US presidential elections have an obvious and rational justification  Other cycles do not   However why cycles in fields seemingly unrelated to finance such as astronomy or weather  patterns may influence the economy  and thus the capital markets  may have a logical  explanation  For example sun spots affect weather patterns on earth which in turn affect  agriculture and therefore capital markets because they are related to agriculture 
4,777,       Kondratieff Wave
5,777,The longest of the widely recognized cycles was identified by Nikolai Kondratieff in the     s   Kondratieff was an economist in the Soviet Union who suggested that Western economies had a     year cycle  He traced cycles from the     s to the time he published this theory in the      s and the economic depression of the     s was consistent with the cycle he identified   His theory was mainly tied to economic cycles and commodity prices but cycles can also be  seen in the prices of equities during the time of his work 
6,777,Kondratieff was executed in a Soviet purge in      but his ideas have come into widespread  acceptance particularly since his works were translated into English in the     s  Two  economists at the London School of Economics E  H  Phelps Brown and Sheila Hopkins  identified a       year economic cycle in the United Kingdom  Together with Kondratieff  credit should be given to two Dutch economists Jacob van Gelderen and Samuel de Wolff who  wrote about a       year economic cycle but published their work earlier in       Their work  came to light only recently however so the long    year economic cycle is known as the
7,777,Kondratieff Wave or K Wave 
8,777,          Year Cycle
9,777,The    year cycle is interesting because three    year cycles make up the longer    year  Kondratieff Wave  The    year cycle is most often mentioned in connection with real estate  prices but it can also be found in equities and other markets 
10,777,       Decennial Pattern
11,777,The decennial pattern is the pattern of average stock market returns  based on the DJIA  broken  down on the basis of the last digit in the year  Years ending with a   have had the worst  performance and years ending with a   have been by far the best  The DJIA was up every year  ending in a   from      until      but it declined     percent in

2,778,       Presidential Cycle
3,778,This cycle in the United States connects the performance of the DJIA with presidential  elections  In this theory years are grouped into categories on the basis of whether they were  election years or the first second or third year following an election  The third year is the year  prior to the next election  The third year shows the best performance  in fact the DJIA  experienced a positive return in every pre election year from      through       One  explanation for this outcome is that with so many politicians up for re election they inject  stimulus into the economy in an attempt to improve their chances to be re elected   Election  years are also usually positive years for the stock market but with less consistency  Post  election years and the so called midterm year have the worst performance 
4,778,These long cycles are important to keep in mind when using other technical analysis tools   However the long cycles described here and other theories about long cycles present a number  of problems  The primary problem is the small sample size  Only    presidential elections have  been held in the United States and only   completed Kondratieff cycles have occurred in US  history  Another problem is that even with the small number of cycles the data do not always  fit the cycle theory and when they do that fit may not be obvious 
5,778,   ELLIOTT WAVE THEORY
6,778,In a theory proposed by R  N  Elliott in      the market moves in regular repeated waves or  cycles  He identified and categorized these waves and wrote in detail about aspects of market  cycles  Elliott was an accountant by training but in      after he contracted a progressive  intestinal illness at age    while working in Latin America he was forced to retire  Then he  turned his attention to a detailed study of equity prices in the United States 
7,778,A decade later in      he published his findings in a book titled The Wave Principle  In  developing the concept that the market moves in waves Elliott relied heavily on Charles Dow s  early work  Elliott described how the market moved in a pattern of five waves moving up in a  bull market in the following pattern      up     down     up     down and     up  He called  this wave the  impulse wave   The impulse wave was followed by a corrective wave with three  components  a   down b   up and c   down 
8,778,When the market is a bear market as defined in Dow Theory that is with both of Dow s  major indices in bear markets the downward movements are impulse waves and are broken  into five waves with upward corrections broken into three subwaves 
9,778,Elliott also noted that each wave could be broken down into smaller and smaller subwaves 
10,778,The longest of the waves is called the  grand supercycle  and takes place over centuries  Elliott  traced grand supercycles back to the founding of the United States and his successors have  continued his work  Each grand supercycle can be broken down into subcycles until ending  with the  subminuette  which unfolds over several minutes  The major cycles are

6,779,  Minute
7,779,  Minuette
8,779,  Subminuette
9,779,An important aspect of Elliott s work is that he discovered that market waves follow patterns  that are ratios of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence  Leonardo Fibonacci was an   th  century Italian mathematician who explained this sequence in his book Liber Abaci but the  sequence was known to mathematicians as far back as     BCE in India  The Fibonacci  sequence starts with the numbers       and then each subsequent number in the sequence is  the sum of the two preceding numbers 
10,779,                        
11,779,Elliott was more interested in the ratios of the numbers in the sequence because he found that  the ratio of the size of subsequent waves was generally a Fibonacci ratio  The ratios of one  Fibonacci number to the next that Elliott considered most important are the following 
12,779,                                                           
13,779,He also noticed that the ratio of a Fibonacci sequence number to its preceding number is  important 
14,779,                                                        
15,779,These ratios converge around        In mathematics       is called the  golden ratio  and it  can be found throughout nature in astronomy biology botany and many other fields  It is  also widely used in art and architecture  The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids on the basis  of this ratio and the ancient Greeks used it widely 
16,779,As noted Elliott numbered the impulse waves     and the corrective waves a b and c  Exhibit     depicts the impulse and corrective waves in a bull market

2,780,Elliott described the characteristics of each wave  Note the following as shown in Exhibit    
3,780,  Wave   starts as a basing pattern and displays an increase in price volume and  breadth    Wave   consists of five smaller waves 
4,780,  Wave   moves down retracing much of the gain in Wave   but not all of it  Common  percentage retracements are Fibonacci ratios such as    percent or    percent  Wave    never erases all of the gains from Wave    Wave   consists of three smaller waves 
5,780,  Wave   moves above the high of the first wave and has strong breadth volume and price  movement  Most of the price movement in an uptrend typically occurs in Wave    Wave    consists of five smaller waves  Wave   often moves prices       times higher than the  length of Wave   which is a Fibonacci ratio 
6,780,  Wave   is again a correction and the ratio of the change in price during this wave to the  price change during the third wave is also generally a Fibonacci ratio  Wave   commonly  reverses    percent of the gain in Wave    Wave   is also an up wave  Generally the  price movement in Wave   is not as great as that in Wave    The exception to the rule is  that Wave   may become extended as when euphoria overtakes the market  Wave    consists of five smaller waves 
7,780,After Wave   is completed the market traces out a series of three corrective waves labeled a b  and c in Exhibit    
8,780,  Wave a is a down wave in a bull market  Wave a itself breaks down into three waves

2,781,  Wave b is an upward movement and breaks down into five waves  Wave b is a false rally  and is often called a  bull trap  
3,781,  Wave c is the final corrective wave  In a bull market it does not move below the start of  the prior Wave   pattern  Wave c breaks down into three subwaves 
4,781,This description of the waves applies to bull markets  in bear markets the impulse waves are  labeled A through E and the corrective waves are labeled     and    Waves in the direction of  the trend consist of five subwaves and counter waves consist of three subwaves 
5,781,In practice a good deal of time is required to become proficient with Elliott Wave Theory   Wave counts may not become evident at first and Elliotticians often have to renumber their  wave counts on the basis of changes in market trends  This theory is widely used however and  the patterns Elliott described can still be observed today 
6,781,As a technician begins to make initial judgments on wave counts the next step is to draw lines  representing Fibonacci ratios on the charts  These lines alert the technician to the levels at  which trends may change in the future and can be used in conjunction with other technical tools  for forecasting  Positive price movements generally take prices up by some Fibonacci ratio of  prior highs  e g      or       and price declines generally reverse prices by a Fibonacci ratio   e g       or         Elliott Wave Theory is used in practice with Dow Theory trend analysis  pattern analysis and oscillator analysis to provide a sense of the general trend in the market  As  Elliott s nine cycles imply Elliott Wave Theory can be applied in both very short term trading  as well as in very long term economic analysis as is the case with most tools used in technical  analysis 
7,781,   INTERMARKET ANALYSIS
8,781,Intermarket analysis is a field within technical analysis that combines analysis of major  categories of securities namely equities bonds currencies and commodities to identify  market trends and possible inflections in a trend  Intermarket analysis also looks at industry  subsectors such as the nine sectors the S P     is divided into and the relationships among  the major stock markets of countries with the largest economies such as the New York  London and Tokyo stock exchanges 
9,781,Intermarket analysis relies heavily on the field of economic analysis for its theoretical  underpinning  The field was pioneered by John Murphy with his      book Intermarket  Technical Analysis  Murphy noted that all markets are inter related and that these relationships  are strengthening with the globalization of the world economy   
10,781,Stock prices are affected by bond prices  High bond prices are a positive for stock  prices since this means low interest rates  Lower interest rates benefit companies  with lower borrowing costs and lead to higher equity valuations in the calculation  of intrinsic value using discounted cash flow analysis in fundamental analysis   Thus rising bond prices are a positive for stock prices and declining bond prices  are a bearish indicator

2,782,Bond prices impact commodity prices  Bond prices move inversely to interest rates   Interest rates move in proportion to expectations to future prices of commodities or  inflation  So declining bond prices are a signal of possible rising commodity prices 
3,782,Currencies impact commodity prices  Most commodity trading is denominated in  US dollars and so prices are commonly quoted in US dollars  As a result a strong  dollar results in lower commodity prices and vice versa 
4,782,In intermarket analysis technicians often look for inflection points in one market as a warning  sign to start looking for a change in trend in a related market  To identify these intermarket  relationships a commonly used tool is relative strength analysis which charts the price of one  security divided by the price of another 
5,782,Exhibit    shows the relative price of    year US Treasury bonds compared with the S P       The rise in T bond price relative to the S P     can be clearly seen  The inflection point in this  chart occurs in March       This point would signal that the time had come to move  investments from bonds to stocks 
6,782,Exhibit     Relative Strength of    Year T Bonds vs  S P     September       July     
7,782,Exhibit    is a relative strength chart depicting the ratio between the S P     and commodity  prices  It shows a clear top and reversal of trend in December       This inflection point shows  US stocks weakening relative to commodities and would indicate that allocating funds away  from the US stocks and into commodities might be appropriate

2,783,In addition to the preceding comparisons once an asset category has been identified relative  strength analysis can be used to identify the strongest performing securities in a sector  For  example if commodities look promising an investor can analyze each of the major  commodities relative to a broad commodity index in order to find the strongest commodity 
3,783,Intermarket analysis can also be used to identify sectors of the equity market to invest in often  in connection with technical observations of the business cycle at any time  The equities of  certain industry sectors tend to perform best at the beginning of an economic cycle  These  sectors include utilities financials consumer nondurables and transportation stocks  As an  economic recovery gets under way retailers manufacturers health care and consumer durables  tend to outperform  Lagging sectors include those tied to commodity prices such as energy and  basic industrial commodities and also technology stocks 
4,783,Observations based on intermarket analysis can also help in allocating funds across national  markets  Certain countries  economies are closely tied to commodities for example Australia  Canada and South Africa  As economies evolve these relationships change  So the  relationships must be monitored closely 
5,783,SUMMARY
6,783,  Technical analysis is a form of security analysis that uses price and volume market data  often graphically displayed 
7,783,  Technical analysis can be used for any freely traded security in the global market and is  used on a wide range of financial instruments such as equities bonds commodity  futures and currency futures

2,784,  Technical analysis is the study of market trends or patterns and relies on recognition of  patterns that have worked in the past in an attempt to predict future security prices   Technicians believe that market trends and patterns repeat themselves and are somewhat  predictable because human behavior tends to repeat itself and is somewhat predictable 
3,784,  Another tenet of technical analysis is that the market brings together the collective  wisdom of multiple participants weights it according to the size of the trades they make  and allows analysts to understand this collective sentiment  Technical analysis relies on  knowledgeable market participants putting this knowledge to work in the market and  thereby influencing prices and volume 
4,784,  Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are equally useful and valid but they  approach the market in different ways  Technical analysis focuses solely on analyzing  markets and the trading of financial instruments whereas fundamental analysis is a much  wider ranging field encompassing financial and economic analysis as well as analysis of  societal and political trends 
5,784,  Technical analysis relies primarily on information gathered from market participants that  is expressed through the interaction of price and volume  Fundamental analysis relies on  information that is external to the market  e g  economic data company financial  information  in an attempt to evaluate a security s value relative to its current price 
6,784,  The usefulness of technical analysis is diminished by any constraints on the security  being freely traded by large outside manipulation of the market and in illiquid markets 
7,784,  Charts provide information about past price behavior and provide a basis for inferences  about likely future price behavior  Various types of charts can be useful in studying the  markets  line charts bar charts candlestick charts and point and figure charts 
8,784,  Relative strength analysis is based on the ratio of the prices of a security to a benchmark  and is used to compare the performance of one asset with the performance of another  asset 
9,784,  Many technicians consider volume information to be very important and watch for the  confirmation in volume of a price trend or the divergence of volume from a price trend 
10,784,  The concept of trend is perhaps the most important aspect of technical analysis  An  uptrend is defined as a security making higher highs and higher lows  To draw an uptrend  line a technician draws a line connecting the lows of the price chart  A downtrend is  defined as a security making lower highs and lower lows  To draw a downtrend line a  technician draws a line connecting the highs of the price chart 
11,784,  Support is defined as a low price range in which the price stops declining because of  buying activity  It is the opposite of resistance which is a price range in which price stops  rising because of selling activity 
12,784,  Chart patterns are formations appearing in price charts that create some type of  recognizable shape 
13,784,  Reversal patterns signal the end of a trend  Common reversal patterns are the head and  shoulders the inverse head and shoulders double tops and bottoms and triple tops and  bottoms

2,785,  Continuation patterns indicate that a market trend in place prior to the pattern formation  will continue once the pattern is completed  Common continuation patterns are triangles  rectangles flags and pennants 
3,785,  Price based indicators incorporate information contained in market prices  Common  price based indicators are the moving average and Bollinger Bands 
4,785,  Momentum oscillator indicators are constructed from price data but they are calculated  so that they fluctuate either between a high and low typically   and     or around   or       Some examples are momentum  or rate of change  oscillators the RSI stochastic  measures and MACD 
5,785,  Sentiment indicators attempt to gauge investor activity for signs of increasing bullishness  or bearishness  Sentiment indicators come in two forms investor polls and calculated  statistical indexes  Opinion polls to gauge investors  sentiment toward the equity market  are conducted by a variety of services  Commonly used calculated statistical indexes are  the put call ratio the VIX margin debt and the short interest ratio 
6,785,  Flow of funds indicators help technicians gauge potential changes in supply and demand  for securities  Some commonly used indicators are the ARMS Index  also called the  TRIN  margin debt  also a sentiment indicator  mutual fund cash positions new equity  issuance and secondary equity offerings 
7,785,  Many technicians use various observed cycles to predict future movements in security  prices  these cycles include Kondratieff waves decennial patterns and the US  presidential cycle 
8,785,  Elliott Wave Theory is an approach to market forecasting that assumes that markets form  repetitive wave patterns which are themselves composed of smaller and smaller  subwaves  The relationships among wave heights are frequently Fibonacci ratios 
9,785,  Intermarket analysis is based on the principle that all markets are interrelated and  influence each other  This approach involves the use of relative strength analysis for  different groups of securities  e g  stocks versus bonds sectors in an economy and  securities from different countries  to make allocation decisions

4,791,B  The first year following a presidential election

6,791,    What is a major problem with long term cycle theories 
7,791,A  The sample size is small 
8,791,B  The data are usually hard to observe 
9,791,C  They occur over such a long period that they are difficult to discern

19,791,A  stochastic oscillators 
20,791,B  Fibonacci ratios 
21,791,C  relative strength analysis 
22,791,SOLUTIONS
23,791,   A is correct  Almost all technical analysis relies on these data inputs 
24,791,   A is correct  Technical analysis works because markets are not efficient and rational and  because human beings tend to behave similarly in similar circumstances  The result is  market trends and patterns that repeat themselves and are somewhat predictable 
25,791,   A is correct  Trends generally must be in place for some time before they are  recognizable  Thus some time may be needed for a change in trend to be identified

2,792,   A is correct  Commodities and currencies do not have underlying financial statements or  an income stream  thus fundamental analysis is useless in determining theoretical values  for them or whether they are over  or undervalued 
3,792,   C is correct  The top and bottom of the bars indicate the highs and lows for the day  the  line on the left indicates the opening price and the line on the right indicates the closing  price 
4,792,   C is correct  Dark and light shading is a unique feature of candlestick charts 
5,792,   C is correct  Rising volume shows conviction by many market participants which is  likely to lead to a continuation of the trend 
6,792,   A is correct  The price of gold in nominal dollars was several orders of magnitude  cheaper     years ago than it is today  roughly US    then versus US      today    Such a wide range of prices lends itself well to being graphically displayed on a  logarithmic scale 
7,792,   B is correct  A downtrend line is constructed by drawing a line connecting the highs of  the price chart 
8,792,    B is correct  It is demonstrated in the following chart 
9,792,Exhibit    Candlestick Chart  GreatWall Information Industry Co  Ltd   Price Data November      September        Price Measured in RMB      
10,792,    B is correct 
11,792,    C is correct  As shown in the following chart Barclays shares traded up to    p on three  occasions each several weeks apart and declined thereafter each time

6,793,    A is correct  A large increase in the number of IPOs increases the supply of equity and if  overall demand remains the same puts downward pressure on equities  Also companies  tend to issue shares of equity when the managers believe they will receive a premium  price which is also an indicator of a market top 
7,793,    B is correct  A value below     is a bullish sign  it means more volume is in rising shares  than in declining ones  The TRIN is calculated as   Advancing issues Declining issues    Volume of advancing issues Volume of declining issues

2,794,    C is correct  Bollinger Bands consist of a moving average and a higher line representing  the moving average plus a set number of standard deviations from average price  for the  same number of periods as used to calculate the moving average  and a lower line that is  a moving average minus the same number of standard deviations 
3,794,    C is correct  Bollinger Bands are price based indicators not momentum oscillators which  are constructed so that they oscillate between a high and a low or around   or     
4,794,    A is correct  Triangles are one of several continuation patterns 
5,794,    C is correct  It is one of several reversal patterns 
6,794,    A is correct  Volume is necessary to confirm the various market rallies and reversals  during the formation of the head and shoulders pattern 
7,794,    B is correct 
8,794,    A is correct  The decennial pattern theory states that years ending with a   will have the  best performance of any of the    years in a decade and that those ending with a zero will  have the worst 
9,794,    C is correct  A possible reason for the superior performance in the third year is that the  US presidential election occurs together with a number of other elections in a four year  cycle so the politicians desiring to be reelected inject money into the economy in the  third year to improve their chances of winning the following year 
10,794,    A is correct  Long term cycles require many years to complete  thus not many cycles are  available to observe 
11,794,    B is correct 
12,794,    A is correct  This is the term for a separate cycle theory 
13,794,    C is correct  Relative strength analysis is often used to compare two asset classes or two  securities
