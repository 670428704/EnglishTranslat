4,17,INTRODUCTION
5,17,Financial analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions   including those related to buying and selling assets   Generally the decisions involve  trading securities  currencies  contracts  commodities  and real assets such as real  estate  Consider several examples      Fixed income analysts evaluate issuer credit  worthiness and macroeconomic  prospects to determine which bonds and notes to buy or sell to preserve capital  while obtaining a fair rate of return     Stock analysts study corporate values to determine which stocks to buy or sell  to maximize the value of their stock portfolios      Corporate treasurers analyze exchange rates  interest rates  and credit condi  tions to determine which currencies to trade and which notes to buy or sell to  have funds available in a needed currency     Risk managers work for producers or users of commodities to calculate how  many commodity futures contracts to buy or sell to manage inventory risks   Financial analysts must understand the characteristics of the markets in which their  decisions will be executed  This reading  by examining those markets from the analyst s  perspective provides that understanding   This reading is organized as follows   Section   examines the functions of the  financial system  Section   introduces assets that investors  information  motivated  traders  and risk managers use to advance their financial objectives and presents ways  practitioners classify these assets into markets   These assets include such financial  instruments as securities  currencies  and some contracts   certain commodities    and real assets   Financial analysts must know the distinctive characteristics of these  trading assets   Section   is an overview of financial intermediaries  entities that facilitate the  functioning of the financial system   Section   discusses the positions that can be  obtained while trading assets   You will learn about the benefits and risks of long and  short positions  how these positions can be financed and how the financing affects  their risks   Section   discusses how market participants order trades and how mar  kets process those orders   These processes must be understood to achieve trading  objectives while controlling transaction costs   Section   focuses on describing primary markets   Section   describes the struc  tures of secondary markets in securities   Sections   and    close the reading with  discussions of the characteristics of a well  functioning financial system and of how  regulation helps make financial markets function better  A summary reviews the  reading  s major ideas and points  and practice problems conclude

7,17,THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
8,17,The financial system includes markets and various financial intermediaries that help  transfer financial assets  real assets  and financial risks in various forms from one entity  to another from one place to another and from one point in time to another  These  transfers take place whenever someone exchanges one asset or financial contract for  another  The assets and contracts that people  people act on behalf of themselves   companies  charities  governments  etc  so the term  people  has a broad definition  in this reading  trade include notes  bonds  stocks  exchange  traded funds  currencies 
1,18,The Functions of the Financial System
2,18, 
3,18,                
4,18,forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  swap contracts  and certain  commodities   When the buyer and seller voluntarily arrange their trades  as is usually  the case the buyer and the seller both expect to be better off  People use the financial system for six main purposes   to save money for the future  to borrow money for current use  to raise equity capital  to manage risks   to exchange assets for immediate and future deliveries   and to trade on information  The main functions of the financial system are to facilitate  the achievement of the purposes for which people use the financial system  the discovery of the rates of return that equate aggregate savings with aggregate  borrowings   and    the allocation of capital to the best uses   These functions are extremely important to economic welfare  In a well  functioning  financial system transaction costs are low analysts can value savings and investments   and scarce capital resources are used well  Sections     through     expand on these three functions   The six subsections of  Section     cover the six main purposes for which people use the financial system and  how the financial system facilitates the achievement of those purposes   Sections     and      discuss determining rates of return and capital allocation efficiency respectively 
5,18,    
6,18,    Helping People Achieve Their Purposes in Using the  Financial System
7,18,People often arrange transactions to achieve more than one purpose when using the  financial system  For example an investor who buys the stock of an oil producer may  do so to move her wealth from the present to the future to hedge the risk that she  will have to pay more for energy in the future and to exploit insightful research that  she conducted that suggests the company  s stock is undervalued in the marketplace   If the investment proves to be successful she will have saved money for the future  managed her energy risk exposure and obtained a return on her research  The separate discussions of each of the six main uses of the financial system by  people will help you better identify the reasons why people trade  Your ability to iden  tify the various uses of the financial system will help you avoid confusion that often  leads to poor financial decisions   The financial intermediaries that are mentioned in  these discussions are explained further in Section   
8,18,      Saving
9,18,People often have money that they choose not to spend now and that they want  available in the future  For example workers who save for their retirements need  to move some of their current earnings into the future  When they retire they will  use their savings to replace the wages that they will no longer be earning   Similarly  companies save money from their sales revenue so that they can pay vendors when  their bills come due repay debt  or acquire assets  for example other companies or  machinery  in the future  To move money from the present to the future savers buy notes  certificates of  deposit  bonds  stocks  mutual funds  or real assets such as real estate  These alter  natives generally provide a better expected rate of return than simply storing money 
1,19, 
2,19,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,19,Savers then sell these assets in the future to fund their future expenditures   When  savers commit money to earn a financial return they commonly are called investors    They invest when they purchase assets  and they divest when they sell them  Investors require a fair rate of return while their money is invested  The required  fair rate of return compensates them for the use of their money and for the risk that  they may lose money if the investment fails or if inflation reduces the real value of  their investments   The financial system facilitates savings when institutions create investment vehicles   such as bank deposits  notes  stocks  and mutual funds  that investors can acquire and  sell without paying substantial transaction costs   When these instruments are fairly  priced and easy to trade investors will use them to save more 
4,19,      Borrowing
5,19,People companies  and governments often want to spend money now that they do  not have  They can obtain money to fund projects that they wish to undertake now by  borrowing it  Companies can also obtain funds by selling ownership or equity interests   covered in Section         Banks and other investors provide those requiring funds  with money because they expect to be repaid with interest or because they expect to  be compensated with future disbursements  such as dividends and capital gains  as  the ownership interest appreciates in value  People may borrow to pay for such items as vacations  homes  cars  or education   They generally borrow through mortgages and personal loans  or by using credit cards    People typically repay these loans with money they earn later  Companies often require money to fund current operations or to engage in new  capital projects   They may borrow the needed funds in a variety of ways  such as  arranging a loan or a line of credit with a bank  or selling fixed income securities to  investors   Companies typically repay their borrowing with income generated in the  future  In addition to borrowing  companies may raise funds by selling ownership  interests   Governments may borrow money to pay salaries and other expenses  to fund  projects  to provide welfare benefits to their citizens and residents  and to subsidize  various activities   Governments borrow by selling bills  notes  or bonds   Governments  repay their debt using future revenues from taxes and in some instances from the  projects funded by these debts   Borrowers can borrow from lenders only if the lenders believe that they will be  repaid  If the lenders believe however that repayment in full with interest may not  occur they will demand higher rates of interest to cover their expected losses and  to compensate them for the discomfit they experience wondering whether they will  lose their money  To lower the costs of borrowing  borrowers often pledge assets as  collateral for their loans   The assets pledged as collateral often include those that will  be purchased by the proceeds of the loan  If the borrowers do not repay their loans   the lenders can sell the collateral and use the proceeds to settle the loans   Lenders often will not loan to borrowers who intend to invest in risky projects   especially if the borrowers cannot pledge other collateral  Investors may still be willing  to supply capital for these risky projects if they believe that the projects will likely  produce valuable future cash flows   Rather than lending money however they will  contribute capital in exchange for equity in the projects   The financial system facilitates borrowing   Lenders aggregate from savers the funds  that borrowers require  Borrowers must convince lenders that they can repay their  loans  and that  in the event they cannot  lenders can recover most of the funds lent    Credit bureaus  credit rating agencies  and governments promote borrowing  credit  bureaus and credit rating agencies do so by collecting and disseminating information  that lenders need to analyze credit prospects and governments do so by establishing  bankruptcy codes and courts that define and enforce the rights of borrowers and

3,20,lenders   When the transaction costs of loans  i e  the costs of arranging  monitoring   and collecting them  are low borrowers can borrow more to fund current expenditures  with credible promises to return the money in the future 
4,20,      Raising Equity Capital
5,20,Companies often raise money for projects by selling  issuing  ownership interests  e g    corporate common stock or partnership interests   Although these equity instruments  legally represent ownership in companies rather than loans to the companies  selling  equity to raise capital is simply another mechanism for moving money from the future  to the present   When shareholders or partners contribute capital to a company the  company obtains money in the present in exchange for equity instruments that will  be entitled to distributions in the future  Although the repayment of the money is  not scheduled as it would be for loans  equity instruments also represent potential  claims on money in the future  The financial system facilitates raising equity capital  Investment banks help com  panies issue equities  analysts value the securities that companies sell and regulatory  reporting requirements and accounting standards attempt to ensure the production of  meaningful financial disclosures   The financial system helps promote capital formation  by producing the financial information needed to determine fair prices for equity   Liquid markets help companies raise capital  In these markets  shareholders can easily  divest their equities as desired  When investors can easily value and trade equities   they are more willing to fund reasonable projects that companies wish to undertake 
6,20,EXAMPLE  
7,20,Financing Capital Projects
8,20,As a chief financial officer  CFO  of a large industrial firm you need to raise  cash within a few months to pay for a project to expand existing and acquire  new manufacturing facilities   What are the primary options available to you 
9,20,Solution 
10,20,Your primary options are to borrow the funds or to raise the funds by selling own  ership interests   If the company borrows the funds  you may have the company  pledge some or all of the project as collateral to reduce the cost of borrowing  
11,20,      Managing Risks
12,20,Many people companies  and governments face financial risks that concern them   These risks include default risk and the risk of changes in interest rates  exchange  rates  raw material prices  and sale prices  among many other risks   These risks are  often managed by trading contracts that serve as hedges for the risks   For example a farmer and a food processor both face risks related to the price of  grain  The farmer fears that prices will be lower than expected when his grain is ready  for sale whereas the food processor fears that prices will be higher than expected when  she has to buy grain in the future  They both can eliminate their exposures to these  risks if they enter into a binding forward contract for the farmer to sell a specified  quantity of grain to the food processor at a future date at a mutually agreed upon  price  By entering into a forward contract that sets the future trade price they both  eliminate their exposure to changing grain prices   In general hedgers trade to offset or insure against risks that concern them  In  addition to forward contracts  they may use futures contracts  option contracts  or  insurance contracts to transfer risk to other entities more willing to bear the risks
1,21,  
2,21,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,21, these contracts will be covered in Section       Often the hedger and the other entity  face exactly the opposite risks  so the transfer makes both more secure as in the grain  example  The financial system facilitates risk management when liquid markets exist in which  risk managers can trade instruments that are correlated  or inversely correlated  with  the risks that concern them without incurring substantial transaction costs   Investment  banks  exchanges  and insurance companies devote substantial resources to designing  such contracts and to ensuring that they will trade in liquid markets   When such  markets exist  people are better able to manage the risks that they face and often are  more willing to undertake risky activities that they expect will be profitable

5,21,People and companies often trade one asset for another that they rate more highly or  equivalently that is more useful to them  They may trade one currency for another  currency or money for a needed commodity or right   Following are some examples  that illustrate these trades      Volkswagen pays its German workers in euros  but the company receives dollars  when it sells cars in the United States   To convert money from dollars to euros   Volkswagen trades in the foreign exchange markets      A Mexican investor who is worried about the prospects for peso inflation or a  potential devaluation of the peso may buy gold in the spot gold market    This  transaction may hedge against the risk of devaluation of the peso because the  value of gold may increase with inflation      A plastic producer must buy carbon credits to emit carbon dioxide when  burning fuel to comply with environmental regulations   The carbon credit is a  legal right that the producer must have to engage in activities that emit carbon  dioxide  In each of these cases  the trades are considered spot market trades because  the instruments trade for immediate delivery  The financial system facilitates these  exchanges when liquid spot markets exist in which people can arrange and settle  trades without substantial transaction costs  
6,21,      Information  Motivated Trading
7,21,Information  motivated traders trade to profit from information that they believe  allows them to predict future prices   Like all other traders  they hope to buy at low  prices and sell at higher prices   Unlike pure investors  however they expect to earn  a return on their information in addition to the normal return expected for bearing  risk through time  Active investment managers are information  motivated traders who collect and  analyze information to identif y securities  contracts  and other assets that their  analyses indicate are under  or overvalued  They then buy those that they consider  undervalued and sell those that they consider overvalued  If successful they obtain a  greater return than the unconditional return that would be expected for bearing the  risk in their positions   The return that they expect to obtain is a conditional return  earned on the basis of the information in their analyses   Practitioners often call this  process active portfolio management   Note that the distinction between pure investors and information  motivated  traders depends on their motives for trading and not on the risks that they take or  their expected holding periods   Investors trade to move wealth from the present to  the future whereas information  motivated traders trade to profit from superior infor  mation about future values   When trading to move wealth forward the time period  may be short or long   For example a bank treasurer may only need to move money

3,22,overnight and might use money market instruments trading in an interbank funds  market to accomplish that   A pension fund however may need to move money     years forward and might do that by using shares trading in a stock market   Both are  investors although their expected holding periods and the risks in the instruments  that they trade are vastly different   In contrast  information  motivated traders trade because their information  based  analyses suggest to them that prices of various instruments will increase or decrease  in the future at a rate faster than others without their information or analytical models  would expect   After establishing their positions  they hope that prices will change  quickly in their favor so that they can close their positions  realize their profits  and  redeploy their capital  These price changes may occur almost instantaneously or they  may take years to occur if information about the mispricing is difficult to obtain or  understand  The two categories of traders are not mutually exclusive  Investors also are often  information  motivated traders   Many investors who want to move wealth forward  through time collect and analyze information to select securities that will allow them  to obtain conditional returns that are greater than the unconditional returns expected  for securities in their assets classes   If they have rational reasons to expect that their  efforts will indeed produce superior returns  they are information  motivated traders    If they consistently fail to produce such returns  their efforts will be futile and they  would have been better off simply buying and holding well  diversified portfolios  
4,22,EXAMPLE  
5,22,Investing versus Information  Motivated Trading
6,22,The head of a large labor union with a pension fund asks you a pension consul  tant  to distinguish between investing and information  motivated trading   You  are expected to provide an explanation that addresses the financial problems  that she faces   How would you respond 
7,22,Solution 
8,22,The object of investing for the pension fund is to move the union s pension assets  from the present to the future when they will be needed to pay the union s retired  pensioners   The pension fund managers will typically do this by buying stocks   bonds  and perhaps other assets   The pension fund managers expect to receive a  fair rate of return on the pension fund s assets without paying excessive transac  tion costs and management fees   The return should compensate the fund for the  risks that it bears and for the time that other people are using the fund s money  The object of information  motivated trading is to earn a return in excess of  the fair rate of return  Information  motivated traders analyze information that  they collect with the hope that their analyses will allow them to predict better  than others where prices will be in the future  They then buy assets that they  think will produce excess returns and sell those that they think will underperform   Active investment managers are information  motivated traders   The characteristic that most distinguishes investors from information   motivated traders is the return that they expect   Although both types of traders  hope to obtain extraordinary returns  investors rationally expect to receive only  fair returns during the periods of their investments   In contrast  information   motivated traders expect to make returns in excess of required fair rates of return   Of course not all investing or information  motivated trading is successful  in  other words  the actual returns may not equal or exceed the expected returns

2,23,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,23,The financial system facilitates information  motivated trading when liquid mar  kets allow active managers to trade without significant transaction costs   Accounting  standards and reporting requirements that produce meaningful financial disclosures  reduce the costs of being well informed but do not necessarily help informed traders  profit because they often compete with each other  The most profitable well  informed  traders are often those that have the most unique insights into future values  
4,23,      Summary
5,23,People use the financial system for many purposes  the most important of which are  saving  borrowing  raising equity capital managing risk  exchanging assets in spot  markets  and information  motivated trading   The financial system best facilitates these  uses when people can trade instruments that interest them in liquid markets  when  institutions provide financial services at low cost  when information about assets and  about credit risks is readily available and when regulation helps ensure that everyone  faithfully honors their contracts  
6,23,    Determining Rates of Return
7,23,Saving  borrowing  and selling equity are all means of moving money through time   Savers move money from the present to the future whereas borrowers and equity  issuers move money from the future to the present   Because time machines do not exist  money can travel forward in time only if an  equal amount of money is travelling in the other direction  This equality always occurs  because borrowers and equity sellers create the securities in which savers invest   For  example the bond sold by a company that needs to move money from the future to  the present is the same bond bought by a saver who needs to move money from the  present to the future  The aggregate amount of money that savers will move from the present to the future  is related to the expected rate of return on their investments   If the expected return  is high they will forgo current consumption and move more money to the future   Similarly the aggregate amount of money that borrowers and equity sellers will move  from the future to the present depends on the costs of borrowing funds or of giving  up ownership  These costs can be expressed as the rate of return that borrowers and  equity sellers are expected to deliver in exchange for obtaining current funds   It is the  same rate that savers expect to receive when delivering current funds   If this rate is  low borrowers and equity sellers will want to move more money to the present from  the future  In other words  they will want to raise more funds   Because the total money saved must equal the total money borrowed and received  in exchange for equity the expected rate of return depends on the aggregate supply  of funds through savings and the aggregate demand for funds   If the rate is too high  savers will want to move more money to the future than borrowers and equity issuers  will want to move to the present  The expected rate will have to be lower to discourage  the savers and to encourage the borrowers and equity issuers   Conversely if the rate  is too low savers will want to move less money forward than borrowers and equity  issuers will want to move to the present   The expected rate will have to be higher to  encourage the savers and to discourage the borrowers and equity issuers   Between  rates too high and too low an expected rate of return exists  in theory in which the  aggregate supply of funds for investing  supply of funds saved  and the aggregate  demand for funds through borrowing and equity issuing are equal  Economists call this rate the equilibrium interest rate  It is the price for moving  money through time  Determining this rate is one of the most important functions of  the financial system  The equilibrium interest rate is the only interest rate that would  exist if all securities were equally risky had equal terms  and were equally liquid  In  fact the required rates of return for securities vary by their risk characteristics  terms

3,24,and liquidity  For a given issuer investors generally require higher rates of return for  equity than for debt  for long  term securities than for short  term securities  and for  illiquid securities than for liquid ones   Financial analysts recognize that all required  rates of return depend on a common equilibrium interest rate plus adjustments for risk

7,24,Solution 
8,24,Savers have money now that they will want to use in the future  Borrowers  want to use money now that they do not have but they expect that they will  have money in the future  Borrowers are loaned money by savers and promise  to repay it in the future  The interest rate is the return that lenders  the savers  expect to receive from  borrowers for allowing borrowers to use the savers  money  The interest rate is  the price of using money  Interest rates depend on the total amount of money that people want to  borrow and the total amount of money that people are willing to lend  Interest  rates are high when in aggregate people value having money now substantially  more than they value having money in the future  In contrast  if many people  with money want to use it in the future and few people presently need more  money than they have interest rates will be low 
9,24,    Capital Allocation Efficiency
10,24,Primary capital markets  primary markets  are the markets in which companies and
11,24,governments raise capital  funds   Companies may raise funds by borrowing money  or by issuing equity  Governments may raise funds by borrowing money  Economies are said to be allocationally efficient when their financial systems allocate  capital  funds  to those uses that are most productive  Although companies may be  interested in getting funding for many potential projects  not all projects are worth  funding   One of the most important functions of the financial system is to ensure  that only the best projects obtain scarce capital funds   the funds available from savers  should be allocated to the most productive uses   In market  based economies  savers determine directly or indirectly which proj  ects obtain capital  Savers determine capital allocations directly by choosing which  securities they will invest in  Savers determine capital allocations indirectly by giving  funds to financial intermediaries that then invest the funds   Because investors fear  the loss of their money they will lend at lower interest rates to borrowers with the  best credit prospects or the best collateral and they will lend at higher rates to other  borrowers with less secure prospects   Similarly they will buy only those equities that  they believe have the best prospects relative to their prices and risks   To avoid losses  investors carefully study the prospects of the various investment  opportunities available to them  The decisions that they make tend to be well informed  which helps ensure that capital is allocated efficiently  The fear of losses by investors

4,25,and by those raising funds to invest in projects ensures that only the best projects  tend to be funded  The process works best when investors are well informed about  the prospects of the various projects   In general investors will fund an equity project if they expect that the value of  the project is greater than its cost  and they will not fund projects otherwise  If the  investor expectations are accurate only projects that should be undertaken will be  funded and all such projects will be funded  Accurate market information thus leads  to efficient capital allocation

7,25,How can poor information about the value of a project result in poor capital  allocation decisions 
8,25,Solution 
9,25,Projects should be undertaken only if their value is greater than their cost   If  investors have poor information and overestimate the value of a project in which  its true value is less than its cost a wealth  diminishing project may be undertaken   Alternatively if investors have poor information and underestimate the value  of a project in which its true value is greater than its cost  a wealth  enhancing  project may not be undertaken 
10,25,ASSETS AND CONTRACTS
11,25,People companies  and governments use many different assets and contracts to fur  ther their financial goals and to manage their risks   The most common assets include  financial assets  such as bank deposits  certificates of deposit  loans  mortgages  cor  porate and government bonds and notes  common and preferred stocks  real estate  investment trusts  master limited partnership interests  pooled investment products   and exchange  traded funds  currencies  certain commodities  such as gold and oil   and real assets  such as real estate   The most common contracts are option futures   forward swap and insurance contracts   People companies  and governments use these  assets and contracts to raise funds  to invest  to profit from information  motivated  trading  to hedge risks  and or to transfer money from one form to another 
12,25,    Classifications of Assets and Markets
13,25,Practitioners often classify assets and the markets in which they trade by various  common characteristics to facilitate communications with their clients  with each  other and with regulators   The most actively traded assets are securities  currencies  contracts  and commod  ities   In addition real assets are traded  Securities generally include debt instruments   equities  and shares in pooled investment vehicles   Currencies are monies issued by  national monetary authorities   Contracts are agreements to exchange securities  cur  rencies  commodities or other contracts in the future  Commodities include precious  metals  energy products  industrial metals  and agricultural products   Real assets are  tangible properties such as real estate airplanes  or machinery  Securities  currencies   and contracts are classified as financial assets whereas commodities and real assets  are classified as physical assets  
1,26,Assets and Contracts
2,26,  
3,26,Securities are further classified as debt or equity  Debt instruments  also called  fixed  income instruments  are promises to repay borrowed money  Equities represent  ownership in companies   Pooled investment vehicle shares represent ownership of an  undivided interest in an investment portfolio  The portfolio may include securities   currencies  contracts  commodities  or real assets   Pooled investment vehicles  such  as exchange  traded funds  which exclusively own shares in other companies  generally  are also considered equities   Securities are also classified by whether they are public or private securities   Public  securities are those registered to trade in public markets  such as on exchanges or  through dealers   In most jurisdictions  issuers must meet stringent minimum regu  latory standards  including reporting and corporate governance standards  to issue  publicly traded securities   Private securities are all other securities   Often only specially qualified investors  can purchase private equities and private debt instruments   Investors may purchase  them directly from the issuer or indirectly through an investment vehicle specifically  formed to hold such securities   Issuers often issue private securities when they find  public reporting standards too burdensome or when they do not want to conform  to the regulatory standards associated with public equity  Venture capital is private  equity that investors supply to companies when or shortly after they are founded   Private securities generally are illiquid  In contrast  many public securities trade in  liquid markets in which sellers can easily find buyers for their securities   Contracts are derivative contracts if their values depend on the prices of other  underlying assets   Derivative contracts may be classified as physical or financial  depending on whether the underlying instruments are physical products or finan  cial securities   Equity derivatives are contracts whose values depend on equities or  indexes of equities   Fixed  income derivatives are contracts whose values depend on  debt securities or indexes of debt securities   Practitioners classif y markets by whether the markets trade instruments for  immediate delivery or for future delivery  Markets that trade contracts that call for  delivery in the future are forward or futures markets   Those that trade for immediate  delivery are called spot markets to distinguish them from forward markets that trade  contracts on the same underlying instruments   Options markets trade contracts that  deliver in the future but delivery takes place only if the holders of the options choose  to exercise them  When issuers sell securities to investors  practitioners say that they trade in the  primary market  When investors sell those securities to others  they trade in the  secondary market  In the primary market  funds flow to the issuer of the security  from the purchaser  In the secondary market  funds flow between traders   Practitioners classify financial markets as money markets or capital markets   Money  markets trade debt instruments maturing in one year or less   The most common  such instruments are repurchase agreements  defined in Section        negotiable  certificates of deposit  government bills  and commercial paper  In contrast  capital  markets trade instruments of longer duration such as bonds and equities  whose  values depend on the credit  worthiness of the issuers and on payments of interest or  dividends that will be made in the future and may be uncertain  Corporations generally  finance their operations in the capital markets  but some also finance a portion of their  operations by issuing short  term securities  such as commercial paper  Finally practitioners distinguish between traditional investment markets and  alternative investment markets  Traditional investments include all publicly traded  debts and equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles that hold publicly traded  debts and or equities   Alternative investments include hedge funds private equi  ties  including venture capital  commodities  real estate securities and real estate  properties  securitized debts  operating leases  machinery collectibles  and precious  gems   Because these investments are often hard to trade and hard to value they may

5,27,Asset and Market Classification
6,27,The investment policy of a mutual fund only permits the fund to invest in pub  lic equities traded in secondary markets   Would the fund be able to purchase    Common stock of a company that trades on a large stock exchange    Common stock of a public company that trades only through dealers    A government bond    A single stock futures contract    Common stock sold for the first time by a properly registered public  company    Shares in a privately held bank with     billion of capital 
7,27,Solution to   
8,27,Yes   Common stock is equity  Those common stocks that trade on large exchanges  invariably are public equities that trade in secondary markets  
9,27,Solution to   
10,27,Yes   Dealer markets are secondary markets and the security is a public equity 
11,27,Solution to   
12,27,No  Although government bonds are public securities  they are not equities    They are debt securities  
13,27,Solution to   
14,27,No  Although the underlying instruments for single stock futures are invariably  public equities  single stock futures are derivative contracts  not equities  
15,27,Solution to   
16,27,No  The fund would not be able to buy these shares because a purchase from  the issuer would be in the primary market   The fund would have to wait until  it could buy the shares from someone other than the issuer 
17,27,Solution to   
18,27,No  These shares are private equities  not public equities   The public prominence  of the company does not make its securities public securities unless they have  been properly registered as public securities  
19,27,    Securities
20,27,People companies  and governments sell securities to raise money  Securities include  bonds  notes  commercial paper mortgages  common stocks  preferred stocks  warrants   mutual fund shares  unit trusts  and depository receipts   These can be classified broadly  as fixed  income instruments  equities  and shares in pooled investment vehicles   Note

3,28,that the legal definition of a security varies by country and may or may not coincide  with the usage here  Securities that are sold to the public or that can be resold to the  public are called issues   Companies and governments are the most common issuers  
4,28,      Fixed Income
5,28,Fixed  income instruments contractually include predetermined payment schedules  that usually include interest and principal payments   Fixed  income instruments  generally are promises to repay borrowed money but may include other instruments  with payment schedules  such as settlements of legal cases or prizes from lotteries    The payment amounts may be pre  specified or they may vary according to a fixed  formula that depends on the future values of an interest rate or a commodity price   Bonds  notes  bills  certificates of deposit  commercial paper repurchase agreements   loan agreements  and mortgages are examples of promises to repay money in the  future  People companies  and governments create fixed  income instruments when  they borrow money  Corporations and governments issue bonds and notes   Fixed  income securities with  shorter maturities are called  notes   those with longer maturities are called  bonds     The cutoff is usually at    years   In practice however the terms are generally used  interchangeably  Both become short  term instruments when the remaining time until  maturity is short  usually taken to be one year or less   Some corporations issue convertible bonds  which are typically convertible into  stock  usually at the option of the holder after some period  If stock prices are high so  that conversion is likely convertibles are valued like stock   Conversely if stock prices  are low so that conversion is unlikely convertibles are valued like bonds   Bills  certificates of deposit  and commercial paper are respectively issued by  governments  banks  and corporations   They usually mature within a year of being  issued  certificates of deposit sometimes have longer initial maturities   Repurchase agreements  repos  are short  term lending instruments   The term can  be as short as overnight   A borrower seeking funds will sell an instrument typically  a high quality bond to a lender with an agreement to repurchase it later at a slightly  higher price based on an agreed upon interest rate  Practitioners distinguish between short  term intermediate  term and long  term  fixed  income securities   No general consensus exists about the definition of short   term intermediate  term and long  term  Instruments that mature in less than one  to two years are considered short  term instruments whereas those that mature in  more than five to ten years are considered long  term instruments   In the middle are  intermediate  term instruments   Instruments trading in money markets are called money market instruments   Such  instruments are traded debt instruments maturing in one year or less   Money market  funds and corporations seeking a return on their short  term cash balances typically  hold money market instruments  
6,28,      Equities
7,28,Equities represent ownership rights in companies   These include common and pre  ferred shares   Common shareholders own residual rights to the assets of the company   They have the right to receive any dividends declared by the boards of directors  and  in the event of liquidation any assets remaining after all other claims are paid  Acting  through the boards of directors that they elect  common shareholders usually can  select the managers who run the corporations   Preferred shares are equities that have preferred rights  relative to common shares   to the cash flows and assets of the company  Preferred shareholders generally have  the right to receive a specific dividend on a regular basis   If the preferred share is a  cumulative preferred equity the company must pay the preferred shareholders any  previously omitted dividends before it can pay dividends to the common shareholders  
1,29,  
2,29,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,29,Preferred shareholders also have higher claims to assets relative to common share  holders in the event of corporate liquidation  For valuation purposes  financial analysts  generally treat preferred stocks as fixed  income securities when the issuers will clearly  be able to pay their promised dividends in the foreseeable future  Warrants are securities issued by a corporation that allow the warrant holders to  buy a security issued by that corporation if they so desire usually at any time before  the warrants expire or if not  upon expiration  The security that warrant holders can  buy usually is the issuer  s common stock  in which case the warrants are considered  equities because the warrant holders can obtain equity in the company by exercising  their warrants   The warrant exercise price is the price that the warrant holder must  pay to buy the security

5,29,Securities
6,29,What factors distinguish fixed  income securities from equities 
7,29,Solution 
8,29,Fixed  income securities generate income on a regular schedule  They derive  their value from the promise to pay a scheduled cash flow  The most common  fixed  income securities are promises made by people companies  and govern  ments to repay loans   Equities represent residual ownership in companies after all other claims  including any fixed  income liabilities of the company have been satisfied  For  corporations  the claims of preferred equities typically have priority over the  claims of common equities   Common equities have the residual ownership in  corporations  
9,29,      Pooled Investments
10,29,Pooled investment vehicles are mutual funds  trusts  depositories  and hedge funds   that issue securities that represent shared ownership in the assets that these entities  hold  The securities created by mutual funds  trusts  depositories  and hedge fund  are respectively called shares units depository receipts and limited partnership  interests but practitioners often use these terms interchangeably  People invest in  pooled investment vehicles to benefit from the investment management services of  their managers and from diversification opportunities that are not readily available  to them on an individual basis   Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from many investors for  investment in a portfolio of securities   They are often legally organized as investment  trusts or as corporate investment companies   Pooled investment vehicles may be  open  ended or closed  ended  Open  ended funds issue new shares and redeem existing  shares on demand usually on a daily basis   The price at which a fund redeems and  sells the fund s shares is based on the net asset value of the fund s portfolio which  is the difference between the fund s assets and liabilities  expressed on a per share  basis   Investors generally buy and sell open  ended mutual funds by trading with the  mutual fund  In contrast closed  end funds issue shares in primary market offerings that the fund  or its investment bankers arrange  Once issued investors cannot sell their shares of  the fund back to the fund by demanding redemption  Instead investors in closed  end  funds must sell their shares to other investors in the secondary market  The secondary  market prices of closed  end funds may differ sometimes quite significantly from  their net asset values   Closed  end funds generally trade at a discount to their net asset
1,30,Assets and Contracts
2,30,  
3,30,values   The discount reflects the expenses of running the fund and sometimes investor  concerns about the quality of the management   Closed  end funds may also trade at  a discount or a premium to net asset value when investors believe that the portfolio  securities are overvalued or undervalued  Many financial analysts thus believe that  discounts and premiums on closed  end funds measure market sentiment   Exchange  traded funds  ETFs  and exchange  traded notes  ETNs  are open  ended  funds that investors can trade among themselves in secondary markets   The prices at  which ETFs trade rarely differ much from net asset values because a class of investors   known as authorized participants  APs  has the option of trading directly with the  ETF  If the market price of an equity ETF is sufficiently below its net asset value APs  will buy shares in the secondary market at market price and redeem shares at net  asset value with the fund  Conversely if the price of an ETF is sufficiently above its  net asset value APs will buy shares from the fund at net asset value and sell shares  in the secondary market at market price  As a result  the market price and net asset  values of ETFs tend to converge  Many ETFs permit only in  kind deposits and redemptions   Buyers who buy directly  from such a fund pay for their shares with a portfolio of securities rather than with  cash  Similarly sellers receive a portfolio of securities   The transaction portfolio gen  erally is very similar often essentially identical to the portfolio held by the fund   Practitioners sometimes call such funds  depositories  because they issue depository  receipts for the portfolios that traders deposit with them  The traders then trade the  receipts in the secondary market   Some warehouses holding industrial materials and  precious metals also issue tradable warehouse receipts   Asset  backed securities are securities whose values and income payments are  derived from a pool of assets  such as mortgage bonds  credit card debt  or car loans    These securities typically pass interest and principal payments received from the pool  of assets through to their holders on a monthly basis   These payments may depend  on formulas that give some classes of securities called tranches backed by the pool  more value than other classes   Hedge funds are investment funds that generally organize as limited partnerships    The hedge fund managers are the general partners   The limited partners are qualified  investors who are wealthy enough and well informed enough to tolerate and accept  substantial losses  should they occur  The regulatory requirements to participate in a  hedge fund and the regulatory restrictions on hedge funds vary by jurisdiction  Most  hedge funds follow only one investment strategy but no single investment strategy  characterizes hedge funds as a group  Hedge funds exist that follow almost every  imaginable strategy ranging from long short arbitrage in the stock markets to direct  investments in exotic alternative assets   The primary distinguishing characteristic of hedge funds is their management  compensation scheme  Almost all funds pay their managers with an annual fee that is  proportional to their assets and with an additional performance fee that depends on  the wealth that the funds generate for their shareholders   A secondary distinguishing  characteristic of many hedge funds is the use of leverage to increase risk exposure  and to hopefully increase returns  
4,30,    Currencies
5,30,Currencies are monies issued by national monetary authorities   Approximately      currencies are currently in use throughout the world  Some of these currencies are  regarded as reserve currencies   Reserve currencies are currencies that national central  banks and other monetary authorities hold in significant quantities   The primary reserve  currencies are the US dollar and the euro  Secondary reserve currencies include the  British pound the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc

2,31,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,31,Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets   In spot currency transactions  one  currency is immediately or almost immediately exchanged for another  The rate of  exchange is called the spot exchange rate  Traders typically negotiate institutional trades  in multiples of large quantities  such as US    million or      million  Institutional  trades generally settle in two business days   Retail currency trades most commonly take place through commercial banks when  their customers exchange currencies at a location of the bank  use ATM machines  when travelling to withdraw a different currency than the currency in which their  bank accounts are denominated or use credit cards to buy items priced in different  currencies   Retail currency trades also take place at airport kiosks  at store front  currency exchanges  or on the street  
4,31,    Contracts
5,31,A contract is an agreement among traders to do something in the future  Contracts  include forward futures  swap option and insurance contracts   The values of most  contracts depend on the value of an underlying asset   The underlying asset may be  a commodity a security an index representing the values of other instruments  a  currency pair or basket  or other contracts   Contracts provide for some physical or cash settlement in the future  In a phys  ically settled contract  settlement occurs when the parties to the contract physically  exchange some item such as tomatoes  pork bellies  or gold bars   Physical settlement  also includes the delivery of such financial instruments as bonds  equities  or futures  contracts even though the delivery is electronic  In contrast  cash settled contracts  settle through cash payments   The amount of the payment depends on formulas  specified in the contracts   Financial analysts classify contracts by whether they are physical or financial based  on the nature of the underlying asset   If the underlying asset is a physical product   the contract is a physical  otherwise the contract is a financial  Examples of assets  classified as physical include contracts for the delivery of petroleum lumber and gold   Examples of assets classified as financial include option contracts  and contracts on  interest rates  stock indexes  currencies  and credit default swaps   Contracts that call for immediate delivery are called spot contracts  and they trade  in spot markets   Immediate delivery generally is three days or less  but depends on  each market   All other contracts involve what practitioners call futurity  They derive  their values from events that will take place in the future

8,31,Contracts for difference  CFD  allow people to speculate on price changes for  an underlying asset  such as a common stock or an index   Dealers generally  sell CFDs to their clients   When the clients sell the CFDs back to their dealer  they receive any appreciation in the underlying asset s price between the time  of purchase and sale  open and close  of the contract   If the underlying asset s  price drops over this interval the client pays the dealer the difference    Are contracts for difference derivative contracts    Are contracts for difference based on copper prices cash settled or physi  cally settled 
1,32,  
2,32,Assets and Contracts
3,32,Solution to   
4,32,Contracts for difference are derivative contracts because their values are derived  from changes in the prices of the underlying asset on which they are based 
5,32,Solution to   
6,32,All contracts for difference are cash settled contracts regardless of the under  lying asset on which they are based because they settle in cash and not in the  underlying asset  
7,32,      Forward Contracts
8,32,A forward contract is an agreement to trade the underlying asset in the future at a  price agreed upon today  For example a contract for the sale of wheat after the harvest  is a forward contract   People often use forward contracts to reduce risk   Before plant  ing wheat  farmers like to know the price at which they will sell their crop  Similarly  before committing to sell flour to bakers in the future millers like to know the prices  that they will pay for wheat   The farmer and the miller both reduce their operating  risks by agreeing to trade wheat forward  Practitioners call such traders hedgers because they use their contractual com  mitments to hedge their risks   If the price of wheat falls  the wheat farmer  s crop will  drop in value on the spot market but he has a contract to sell wheat in the future at  a higher fixed price  The forward contract has become more valuable to the farmer   Conversely if the price of wheat rises  the miller  s future obligation to sell flour will  become more burdensome because of the high price he would have to pay for wheat  on the spot market  but the miller has a contract to buy wheat at a lower fixed price   The forward contract has become more valuable to the miller  In both cases  fluc  tuations in the spot price are hedged by the forward contract   The forward contract  offsets the operating risks that the hedgers face  Consider a simple example of hedging   A tomato farmer in southern Ontario  Canada  grows tomatoes for processing into tomato sauce  The farmer expects to harvest         bushels and that the price at harvest will be        That price however could  fluctuate significantly before the harvest   If the price of tomatoes drops to       the  farmer would lose       per bushel                 relative to his expectations  or a  total of         Now suppose that the farmer can sell tomatoes forward to Heinz at        for delivery at the harvest   If the farmer sells        bushels forward and the  price of tomatoes drops to       the farmer would still be able to sell his tomatoes  for       and thus would not suffer from the drop in price of tomatoes

10,32,Hedging Gold Production
11,32,An Indonesian gold producer invests in a mine expansion project on the expec  tation that gold prices will remain at or above       rupiah per gram when the  new project starts producing ore    What risks does the gold producer face with respect to the price of gold    How might the gold producer hedge its gold price risk 
12,32,Solution to   
13,32,The gold producer faces the risk that the price of gold could fall below        rupiah before it can sell its new production  If so the investment in the expan  sion project will be less profitable than expected and may even generate losses  for the mine 
1,33,  
2,33,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,33,Solution to   
4,33,The gold producer could hedge the gold price risk by selling gold forward  hopefully at a price near       rupiah  Even if the price of gold falls  the gold  producer would get paid the contract price 
5,33,Forward contracts are very common but two problems limit their usefulness for  many market participants   The first problem is counterparty risk   Counterparty risk  is the risk that the other party to a contract will fail to honor the terms of the contract   Concerns about counterparty risk ensure that generally only parties who have long   standing relationships with each other execute forward contracts   Trustworthiness  is critical when prices are volatile because after a large price change one side or the  other may prefer not to settle the contract   The second problem is liquidity  Trading out of a forward contract is very difficult  because it can only be done with the consent of the other party  The liquidity problem  ensures that forward contracts tend to be executed only among participants for whom  delivery is economically efficient and quite certain at the time of contracting so that  both parties will want to arrange for delivery  The counterparty risk problem and the liquidity problem often make it difficult for  market participants to obtain the hedging benefits associated with forward contract  ing   Fortunately futures contracts have been developed to mitigate these problems  
6,33,      Futures Contracts
7,33,A futures contract is a standardized forward contract for which a clearinghouse  guarantees the performance of all traders   The buyer of a futures contract is the side  that will take physical delivery or its cash equivalent   The seller of a futures contract  is the side that is liable for the delivery or its cash equivalent   A clearinghouse is an  organization that ensures that no trader is harmed if another trader fails to honor  the contract   In effect  the clearinghouse acts as the buyer for every seller and as the  seller for every buyer  Buyers and sellers  therefore can trade futures without wor  rying whether their counterparties are creditworthy  Because futures contracts are  standardized a buyer can eliminate his obligation to buy by selling his contract to  anyone  A seller similarly can eliminate her obligation to deliver by buying a contact  from anyone  In either case the clearinghouse will release the trader from all future  obligations if his or her long and short positions exactly offset each other  To protect against defaults  futures clearinghouses require that all participants  post with the clearinghouse an amount of money known as initial margin when  they enter a contract   The clearinghouse then settles the margin accounts on a daily  basis   All participants who have lost on their contracts that day will have the amount  of their losses deducted from their margin by the clearinghouse  The clearinghouse  similarly increases margins for all participants who gained on that day  Participants  whose margins drop below the required maintenance margin must replenish their  accounts   If a participant does not provide sufficient additional margin when required  the participant s broker will immediately trade to offset the participant s position   These variation margin payments ensure that the liabilities associated with futures  contracts do not grow large

2,34,Assets and Contracts
3,34,EXAMPLE  
4,34,Futures Margin
5,34,NYMEX s Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contract specifies the delivery of       barrels of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil when the contract finally settles    A broker requires that its clients post an initial overnight margin of       per  contract and an overnight maintenance margin of       per contract   A client  buys ten contracts at     per barrel through this broker  On the next day the  contract settles for     per barrel  How much additional margin will the client  have to provide to his broker 
6,34,Solution 
7,34,The client lost three dollars per barrel  he is the side committed to take delivery  or its cash equivalent at     per barrel   This results in a       loss on each  of his    contracts  and a total loss of         His initial margin of        is  reduced by        leaving        in his margin account   Because his account  has dropped below the maintenance margin requirement of        the client  will get a margin call  The client must provide an additional                           to replenish his margin account   the account is replenished to the  amount of the initial margin  The client will only receive another margin call if  his account drops to below        again 
8,34,Futures contracts have vastly improved the efficiency of forward contracting mar  kets   Traders can trade standardized futures contracts with anyone without worrying  about counterparty risk  and they can close their positions by arranging offsetting  trades   Hedgers for whom the terms of the standard contract are not ideal generally  still use the futures markets because the contracts embody most of the price risk that  concerns them  They simply offset  close out  their futures positions  at the same time  they enter spot contracts on which they make or take ultimate delivery 
9,34,EXAMPLE   
10,34,Forward and Futures Contracts
11,34,What feature most distinguishes futures contracts from forward contracts 
12,34,Solution 
13,34,A futures contract is a standardized forward contract for which a clearinghouse  guarantees the performance of all buyers and sellers   The clearinghouse reduces  the counterparty risk problem  The clearinghouse allows a buyer who has bought  a contract from one person and sold the same contract to another person to  net out the two obligations so that she is no longer liable for either side of the  contract   the positions are closed  The ability to trade futures contracts provides  liquidity in futures contracts compared with forward contracts  
14,34,      Swap Contracts
15,34,A swap contract is an agreement to exchange payments of periodic cash flows that  depend on future asset prices or interest rates   For example in a typical interest rate  swap at periodic intervals  one party makes fixed cash payments to the counterparty  in exchange for variable cash payments from the counterparty  The variable payments  are based on a pre  specified variable interest rate such as the London Interbank Offered
1,35,  
2,35,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,35,Rate  Libor   This swap effectively exchanges fixed interest payments for variable  interest payments   Because the variable rate is set in the future the cash flows for  this contract are uncertain when the parties enter the contract   Investment managers often enter interest rate swaps when they own a fixed long   term income stream that they want to convert to a cash flow that varies with current  short  term interest rates  or vice versa   The conversion may allow them to substantially  reduce the total interest rate risk to which they are exposed  Hedgers often use swap  contracts to manage risks   In a commodity swap one party typically makes fixed payments in exchange for  payments that depend on future prices of a commodity such as oil  In a currency  swap the parties exchange payments denominated in different currencies   The pay  ments may be fixed or they may vary depending on future interest rates in the two  countries   In an equity swap the parties exchange fixed cash payments for payments  that depend on the returns to a stock or a stock index  
4,35,EXAMPLE   
5,35,Swap and Forward Contracts
6,35,What feature most distinguishes a swap contract from a cash  settled forward  contract 
7,35,Solution 
8,35,Both contracts provide for the exchange of cash payments in the future  A  forward contract only has a single cash payment at the end that depends on an  underlying price or index at the end  In contrast  a swap contract has several  scheduled periodic payments  each of which depends on an underlying price or  index at the time of the payment  
9,35,      Option Contracts
10,35,An option contract allows the holder  the purchaser  of the option to buy or sell  depending on the type of option an underlying instrument at a specified price at or  before a specified date in the future  Those that do buy or sell are said to exercise their  contracts   An option to buy is a call option and an option to sell is a put option  The  specified price is called the strike price  exercise price   If the holders can exercise  their contracts only when they mature they are European  style contracts   If they can  exercise the contracts earlier they are American  style contracts   Many exchanges list  standardized option contracts on individual stocks  stock indexes  futures contracts   currencies  swaps  and precious metals   Institutions also trade many customized option  contracts with dealers in the over  the  counter derivative market   Option holders generally will exercise call options if the strike price is below the  market price of the underlying instrument  in which case they will be able to buy at a  lower price than the market price  Similarly they will exercise put options if the strike  price is above the underlying instrument price so that they sell at a higher price than  the market price  Otherwise option holders allow their options to expire as worthless   The price that traders pay for an option is the option premium  Options can be  quite expensive because unlike forward and futures contracts  they do not impose  any liability on the holder  The premium compensates the sellers of options called  option writers for giving the call option holders the right to potentially buy below  market prices and put option holders the right to potentially sell above market prices    Because the writers must trade if the holders exercise their options  option contracts  may impose substantial liabilities on the writers

4,36,Option and Forward Contracts
5,36,What feature most distinguishes option contracts from forward contracts 
6,36,Solution 
7,36,The holder of an option contract has the right  but not the obligation to buy   for a call option  or sell  for a put option  the underlying instrument at some  time in the future  The writer of an option contract must trade the underlying  instrument if the holder exercises the option  In contrast  the two parties to a forward contract must trade the underlying  instrument  or its equivalent value for a cash  settled contract  at some time in  the future if either party wants to settle the contract  
8,36,      Other Contracts
9,36,Insurance contracts pay their beneficiaries a cash benefit if some event occurs   Life  liability and automobile insurance are examples of insurance contracts sold to retail  clients   People generally use insurance contracts to compensate for losses that they  will experience if bad things happen unexpectedly  Insurance contracts allow them  to hedge risks that they face  Credit default swaps  CDS  are insurance contracts that promise payment of  principal in the event that a company defaults on its bonds   Bondholders use credit  default swaps to convert risky bonds into more secure investments   Other creditors  of the company may also buy them to hedge against the risk they will not be paid if  the company goes bankrupt   Well  informed traders who believe that a corporation will default on its bonds  may buy credit default swaps written on the corporation s bonds if the swap prices  are sufficiently low  If they are correct  the traders will profit if the payoff to the swap  is more than the cost of buying and maintaining the swap position  People sometimes also buy insurance contracts as investments  especially in juris  dictions where payouts from insurance contracts are not subject to as much taxation as  are payouts to other investment vehicles   They may buy these contracts directly from  insurance companies  or they may buy already issued contracts from their owners    For example the life settlements market trades life insurance contracts that people  sell to investors when they need cash 
10,36,    Commodities
11,36,Commodities include precious metals  energy products  industrial metals  agricul  tural products  and carbon credits   Spot commodity markets trade commodities for  immediate delivery whereas the forward and futures markets trade commodities for  future delivery  Managers seeking positions in commodities can acquire them directly  by trading in the spot markets or indirectly by trading forward and futures contracts   The producers and processors of industrial metals and agricultural products are  the primary users of the spot commodity markets because they generally are best  able to take and make delivery and to store physical products   They undertake these  activities in the normal course of operating their businesses   Their ability to handle  physical products and the information that they gather operating businesses also  gives them substantial advantages as information  motivated traders in these markets    Many producers employ financial analysts to help them analyze commodity market  conditions so that they can best manage their inventories to hedge their operational  risks and to speculate on future price changes  
1,37,  
2,37,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,37,Commodities also interest information  motivated traders and investment managers  because they can use them as hedges against risks that they hold in their portfolios  or as vehicles to speculate on future price changes   Most such traders take positions  in the futures markets because they usually do not have facilities to handle most  physical products nor can they easily obtain them  They also cannot easily cope with  the normal variation in qualities that characterizes many commodities   Information   motivated traders and investment managers also prefer to trade in futures markets  because most futures markets are more liquid than their associated spot markets  and forward markets   The liquidity allows them to easily close their positions before  delivery so that they can avoid handling physical products   Some information  motivated traders and investment managers  however trade in  the spot commodity markets  especially when they can easily contract for low  cost  storage  Commodities for which delivery and storage costs are lowest are nonperish  able products for which the ratio of value to weight is high and variation in quality is  low  These generally include precious metals  industrial diamonds  such high  value  industrial metals as copper aluminum and mercury and carbon credits  
4,37,    Real Assets
5,37,Real assets include such tangible properties as real estate airplanes  machinery  or lumber stands   These assets normally are held by operating companies  such as  real estate developers  airplane leasing companies  manufacturers  or loggers   Many  institutional investment managers  however have been adding real assets to their  portfolios as direct investments  involving direct ownership of the real assets  and  indirect investments  involving indirect ownership for example purchase of securities  of companies that invest in real assets or real estate investment trusts   Investments  in real assets are attractive to them because of the income and tax benefits that they  often generate and because changes in their values may have a low correlation with  other investments that the managers hold  Direct investments in real assets generally require substantial management to ensure  that the assets are maintained and used efficiently  Investment managers investing in  such assets must either hire personnel to manage them or hire outside management  companies   Either way management of real assets is quite costly  Real assets are unique properties in the sense that no two assets are alike  An  example of a unique property is a real estate parcel  No two parcels are the same  because if nothing else they are located in different places   Real assets generally  differ in their conditions  remaining useful lives  locations  and suitability for various  purposes   These differences are very important to the people who use them so the  market for a given real asset may be very limited  Thus  real assets tend to trade in  very illiquid markets   The heterogeneity of real assets  their illiquidity and the substantial costs of man  aging them are all factors that complicate the valuation of real assets and generally  make them unsuitable for most investment portfolios   These same problems  however  often cause real assets to be misvalued in the market so astute information  motivated  traders may occasionally identify significantly undervalued assets   The benefits from  purchasing such assets  however are often offset by the substantial costs of searching  for them and by the substantial costs of managing them  Many financial intermediaries create entities  such as real estate investment trusts   REITs  and master limited partnerships  MLPs  to securitize real assets and to facilitate  indirect investment in real assets   The financial intermediaries manage the assets and  pass through the net benefits after management costs to the investors who hold these  securities   Because these securities are much more homogenous and divisible than  the real assets that they represent  they tend to trade in much more liquid markets    Thus  they are much more suitable as investments than the real assets themselves

3,38,Of course investors seeking exposure to real assets can also buy shares in cor  porations that hold and operate real assets   Although almost all corporations hold  and operate real assets  many specialize in assets that particularly interest investors  seeking exposure to specific real asset classes   For example investors interested in  owning aircraft can buy an aircraft leasing company such as Waha Capital  Abu Dhabi  Securities Exchange  and Aircastle Limited  NYSE

8,39,FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
9,39,Financial intermediaries help entities achieve their financial goals   These intermedi  aries include commercial mortgage and investment banks   credit unions  credit card  companies  and various other finance corporations   brokers and exchanges   dealers  and arbitrageurs   clearinghouses and depositories   mutual funds and hedge funds    and insurance companies   The services and products that financial intermediaries  provide allow their clients to solve the financial problems that they face more effi  ciently than they could do so by themselves   Financial intermediaries are essential to  well  functioning financial systems   Financial intermediaries are called intermediaries because the services and prod  ucts that they provide help connect buyers to sellers in various ways   Whether the  connections are easy to identify or involve complex financial structures  financial  intermediaries stand between one or more buyers and one or more sellers and help  them transfer capital and risk between them  Financial intermediaries  activities allow  buyers and sellers to benefit from trading  often without any knowledge of the other  This section introduces the main financial intermediaries that provide services and  products in well  developed financial markets   The discussion starts with those inter  mediaries whose services most obviously connect buyers to sellers and then proceeds  to those intermediaries whose services create more subtle connections   Because many  financial intermediaries provide many different types of services  some are mentioned  more than once  The section concludes with a general characterization of the various  ways in which financial intermediaries add value to the financial system 
10,39,    Brokers Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems
11,39,Brokers are agents who fill orders for their clients   They do not trade with their clients    Instead they search for traders who are willing to take the other side of their clients   orders   Individual brokers may work for large brokerage firms  the brokerage arm of  banks  or at exchanges   Some brokers match clients to clients personally  Others use  specialized computer systems to identify potential trades and help their clients fill  their orders   Brokers help their clients trade by reducing the costs of finding coun  terparties for their trades   Block brokers provide brokerage service to large traders   Large orders are hard  to fill because finding a counterparty willing to do a large trade is often quite difficult    A large buy order generally will trade at a premium to the current market price and  a large sell order generally will trade at a discount to the current market price  These  price concessions encourage other traders to trade with the large traders   They also  make large traders reluctant  however to expose their orders to the public before  their trades are arranged because they do not want to move the market   Block bro  kers  therefore carefully manage the exposure of the orders entrusted to them which  makes filling them difficult  
1,40,Financial Intermediaries
2,40,  
3,40,Investment banks provide advice to their mostly corporate clients and help them  arrange transactions such as initial and seasoned securities offerings   Their corporate  finance divisions help corporations finance their business by issuing securities  such  as common and preferred shares  notes  and bonds   Another function of corporate  finance divisions is to help companies identify and acquire other companies  i e  in  mergers and acquisitions   Exchanges provide places where traders can meet to arrange their trades    Historically brokers and dealers met on an exchange floor to negotiate trades    Increasingly exchanges arrange trades for traders based on orders that brokers and  dealers submit to them  Such exchanges essentially act as brokers   The distinction  between exchanges and brokers has become quite blurred  Exchanges and brokers  that use electronic order matching systems to arrange trades among their clients  are functionally indistinguishable in this respect   Examples of exchanges include the  NYSE  Euronext Eurex  Deutsche B rse the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the Tokyo  Stock Exchange and the Singapore Exchange  Exchanges are easily distinguished from brokers by their regulatory operations    Most exchanges regulate their members  behavior when trading on the exchange and  sometimes away from the exchange  Many securities exchanges regulate the issuers that list their securities on the  exchange  These regulations generally require timely financial disclosure  Financial  analysts use this information to value the securities traded at the exchange  Without  such disclosure valuing securities could be very difficult and market prices might  not reflect the fundamental values of the securities   In such situations  well  informed  participants may profit from less  informed participants   To avoid such losses  the  less  informed participants may withdraw from the market which can greatly increase  corporate costs of capital  Some exchanges also prohibit issuers from creating capital structures that would  concentrate voting rights in the hands of a few owners who do not own a commen  surate share of the equity  These regulations attempt to ensure that corporations are  run for the benefit of all shareholders and not to promote the interests of controlling  shareholders who do not have significant economic stakes in the company  Exchanges derive their regulatory authority from their national or regional govern   ments  or through the voluntary agreements of their members and issuers to subject  themselves to the exchange regulations   In most countries  government regulators  oversee the exchange rules and the regulatory operations   Most countries also impose  financial disclosure standards on public issuers   Examples of government regulatory  bodies include the Japanese Financial Services Agency the British Financial Services  Authority the German Bundesanstalt f r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht  the US  Securities and Exchange Commission the Ontario Securities Commission and the  Mexican Comisi n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores  
4,40,Alternative trading systems  ATSs  also known as electronic communications
5,40,networks  ECNs  or multilateral trading facilities  MTFs  are trading venues that  function like exchanges but that do not exercise regulatory authority over their sub  scribers except with respect to the conduct of their trading in their trading systems    Some ATSs operate electronic trading systems that are otherwise indistinguishable  from the trading systems operated by exchanges   Others operate innovative trading  systems that suggest trades to their customers based on information that their cus  tomers share with them or that they obtain through research into their customers   preferences   Many ATSs are known as dark pools because they do not display the  orders that their clients send to them  Large investment managers especially like these  systems because market prices often move to their disadvantage when other traders  know about their large orders   ATSs may be owned and operated by broker dealers   exchanges  banks  or by companies organized solely for this purpose many of which  may be owned by a consortia of brokers dealers and banks   Examples of ATSs include

4,41,    Dealers
5,41,Dealers fill their clients  orders by trading with them  When their clients want to sell  securities or contracts  dealers buy the instruments for their own accounts   If their  clients want to buy securities  dealers sell securities that they own or have borrowed   After completing a transaction dealers hope to reverse the transaction by trading  with another client on the other side of the market   When they are successful they  effectively connect a buyer who arrived at one point in time with a seller who arrived  at another point in time  The service that dealers provide is liquidity  Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell  with low transactions costs when you want to trade  By allowing their clients to trade  when they want to trade dealers provide liquidity to them  In over  the  counter markets   dealers offer liquidity when their clients ask them to trade with them  In exchange  markets  dealers offer liquidity to anyone who is willing to trade at the prices that  the dealers offer at the exchange  Dealers profit when they can buy at prices that on  average are lower than the prices at which they sell  Dealers may organize their operations within proprietary trading houses  investment  banks  and hedge funds  or as sole proprietorships   Some dealers are traditional dealers  in the sense that individuals make trading decisions   Others use computerized trading  to make all trading decisions   Examples of companies with large dealing operations  include Deutsche Securities  Germany  RBC Capital Markets  Canada  Nomura    Japan  Timber Hill  United States  Knight Securities  United States  Goldman Sachs   United States  and IG Group plc  United Kingdom   Almost all investment banks  have large dealing operations   Most dealers also broker orders  and many brokers deal to their customers    Accordingly practitioners often use the term broker dealer to refer to dealers and  brokers   Broker dealers have a conflict of interest with respect to how they fill their  customers  orders   When acting as a broker they must seek the best price for their  customers  orders   When acting as dealers  however they profit most when they sell to  their customers at high prices or buy from their customers at low prices   The problem  is most serious when the customer allows the broker dealer to decide whether to trade  the order with another trader or to fill it as a dealer  Consequently when trading with  a broker dealer some customers specify how they want their orders filled  They may  also trade only with pure agency brokers who do not also deal  Primary dealers are dealers with whom central banks trade when conducting  monetary policy  They buy bills  notes  and bonds when the central banks sell them  to decrease the money supply  The dealers then sell these instruments to their clients    Similarly when the central banks want to increase the money supply the primary  dealers buy these instruments from their clients and sell them to the central banks

6,42,Banks and investment companies create new financial products when they buy and  repackage securities or other assets   For example mortgage banks commonly originate  hundreds or thousands of residential mortgages by lending money to homeowners    They then place the mortgages in a pool and sell shares of the pool to investors as  mortgage pass  through securities  which are also known as mortgage  backed securi  ties   All payments of principal and interest are passed through to the investors each  month after deducting the costs of servicing the mortgages   Investors who purchase  these pass  through securities obtain securities that in aggregate have the same net  cash flows and associated risks as the pool of mortgages   The process of buying assets  placing them in a pool and then selling securities  that represent ownership of the pool is called securitization  Mortgage  backed securities have the advantage that default losses and early  repayments are much more predictable for a diversified portfolio of mortgages than  they are for individual mortgages   They are also attractive to investors who cannot  efficiently service mortgages but wish to invest in mortgages   By securitizing mortgage  pools  the mortgage banks allow investors who are not large enough to buy hundreds  of mortgages to obtain the benefits of diversification and economies of scale in loan  servicing   Securitization greatly improves liquidity in the mortgage markets because it allows  investors in the pass  through securities to buy mortgages indirectly that they otherwise  would not buy  Because the financial risks associated with mortgage  backed securities   debt securities with specified claims on the cash flows of a portfolio of mortgages   are much more predictable than those of individual mortgages  mortgage  backed  securities are easier to price and thus easier to sell when investors need to raise cash   These characteristics make the market for mortgage  backed securities much more  liquid than the market for individual mortgages   Because investors value liquidity the  ability to sell when they want to they will pay more for securitized mortgages than  for individual mortgages   The homeowners benefit because higher mortgage prices  imply lower interest rates   The mortgage bank is a financial intermediary because it connects investors who  want to buy mortgages to homeowners who want to borrow money  The homeowners  sell mortgages to the bank when the bank lends them money  Some mortgage banks form mortgage pools from mortgages that they buy from  other banks that originate the loans   These mortgage banks are also financial inter  mediaries because they connect sellers of mortgages to buyers of mortgage  backed  securities   Although the sellers of the mortgages are the originating lenders and not  the borrowers  the benefits of creating liquid mortgage  backed securities ultimately  flow back to the borrowers   The creation of the pass  through securities generally takes place on the accounts of  the mortgage bank   The bank buys mortgages and sells pass  through securities whose  values depend on the mortgage pool  The mortgages appear on the bank s accounts  as assets and the mortgage  backed securities appear as liabilities   In many securitizations  the financial intermediary avoids placing the assets and  liabilities on its balance sheet by setting up a special corporation or trust that buys  the assets and issues the securities   That corporation or trust is called a special pur  pose vehicle  SPV   or alternatively a special purpose entity  SPE   Conducting a
1,43,  
2,43,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,43,securitization through a special purpose vehicle is advantageous to investors because  their interests in the asset pool are better protected in an SPV than they would be  on the balance sheet of the financial intermediary if the financial intermediary were  to go bankrupt   Financial intermediaries securitize many assets   Besides mortgages  banks securitize  car loans  credit card receivables  bank loans  and airplane leases  to name just a few  assets   As a class  these securities are called asset  backed securities   When financial intermediaries securitize assets  they often create several classes  of securities  called tranches  that have different rights to the cash flows from the  asset pool  The tranches are structured so that some produce more predictable cash  flows than do others   The senior tranches have first rights to the cash flow from the  asset pool  Because the overall risk of a given asset pool cannot be changed the more  junior tranches bear a disproportionate share of the risk of the pool  Practitioners  often call the most junior tranche toxic waste because it is so risky  The complexity  associated with slicing asset pools into tranches can make the resulting securities  difficult to value  Mistakes in valuing these securities contributed to the financial  crisis that started in       Investment companies also create pass  through securities based on investment  pools   For example an exchange  traded fund is an asset  backed security that represents  ownership in the securities and contracts held by the fund  The shareholders benefit  from the securitization because they can buy or sell an entire portfolio in a single  transaction  Because the transaction cost savings are quite substantial exchange  traded  funds often trade in very liquid markets   The investment companies  and sometimes  the arbitrageurs  that create exchange  traded funds are financial intermediaries  because they connect the buyers of the funds to the sellers of the assets that make  up the fund portfolios   More generally the creators of all pooled investment vehicles are financial inter  mediaries that transform portfolios of securities and contracts into securities that  represent undivided ownership of the portfolios   The investors in these funds thus  indirectly invest in the securities held by the fund  They benefit from the expertise of  the investment manager and from obtaining a portfolio that may be more diversified  than one they might otherwise be able to hold 
4,43,    Depository Institutions and Other Financial Corporations
5,43,Depository institutions include commercial banks  savings and loan banks  credit  unions  and similar institutions that raise funds from depositors and other investors  and lend it to borrowers   The banks give their depositors interest and transaction  services  such as check writing and check cashing  in exchange for using their money   They may also raise funds by selling bonds or equity in the bank   These banks are financial intermediaries because they transfer funds from their  depositors and investors to their borrowers   The depositors and investors benefit  because they obtain a return  in interest  transaction services  dividends  or capital  appreciation  on their funds without having to contract with the borrowers and  manage their loans   The borrowers benefit because they obtain the funds that they  need without having to search for investors who will trust them to repay their loans   Many other financial corporations provide credit services   For example acceptance  corporations  discount corporations  payday advance corporations  and factors pro  vide credit to borrowers by lending them money secured by such assets as consumer  loans  machinery future paychecks  or accounts receivables   They finance these loans  by selling commercial paper bonds  and shares to investors   These corporations are  intermediaries because they connect investors to borrowers   The investors obtain  investments secured by a diversified portfolio of loans while the borrowers obtain  funds without having to search for investors  
1,44,Financial Intermediaries
2,44,  
3,44,Brokers also act as financial intermediaries when they lend funds to clients who  want to buy securities on margin  They generally obtain the funds from other clients  who deposit them in their accounts   Brokers who provide these services to hedge  funds and other similar institutions are called prime brokers   Banks  financial corporations  and brokers can only raise money from depositors and  other lenders because their equity owners retain residual interests in the performance  of the loans that they make  If the borrowers default  the depositors and other lenders  have priority claims over the equity owners   If insufficient money is collected from  the borrowers  shareholders  equity is used to pay their depositors and other lenders    The risk of losing capital focuses the equity owners  and management s attention so  that credit is not offered foolishly  Because the ability of these companies to cover their credit losses is limited by the  capital that their owners invest in them the depositors and other investors who lend  them money pay close attention to how much money the owners have at risk   For  example if a finance corporation is poorly capitalized its shareholders will lose little  if its clients default on the loans that the finance corporation makes to them  In that  case the finance corporation will have little incentive to lend only to creditworthy  borrowers and to effectively manage collection on those loans once they have been  made  Worse it may even choose to lend to borrowers with poor credit because the  interest rates that they can charge such borrowers are higher  Until those loans default  the higher income will make the corporation appear to be more profitable than it actu  ally is   Depositors and other investors are aware of these problems and generally pay  close attention to them  Accordingly poorly capitalized financial institutions cannot  easily borrow money to finance their operations at favorable rates   Depository banks and financial corporations are similar to securitized asset pools  that issue pass  through securities   Their depositors and investors own securities  that ultimately are backed by an asset pool consisting of their loan portfolios   The  depositors generally hold the most senior tranche followed by the other creditors    The shareholders hold the most junior tranche  In the event of bankruptcy they are  paid only if everyone else is paid

8,44,Commercial banks collect deposits from investors and lend them to borrowers    They are intermediaries because they connect lenders to borrowers   Commercial  banks also provide transaction services that make it easier for the banks  depos  itory customers to pay bills and collect funds from their own customers  
9,44,    Insurance Companies
10,44,Insurance companies help people and companies offset risks that concern them  They  do this by creating insurance contracts  policies  that provide a payment in the event  that some loss occurs   The insured buy these contracts to hedge against potential losses    Common examples of insurance contracts include auto fire life liability medical  theft  and disaster insurance contracts

2,45,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,45,Credit default swaps are also insurance contracts  but historically they have not  been subject to the same reserve requirements that most governments apply to more  traditional insurance contracts   They may be sold by insurance companies or by other  financial entities  such as investment banks or hedge funds   Insurance contracts transfer risk from those who buy the contracts to those who sell  them  Although insurance companies occasionally broker trades between the insured  and the insurer they more commonly provide the insurance themselves   In that case  the insurance company  s owners and creditors become the indirect insurers of the  risks that the insurance company assumes   Insurance companies also often transfer  risks that they do not wish to bear by buying reinsurance policies from reinsurers   Insurers are financial intermediaries because they connect the buyers of their  insurance contracts with investors  creditors  and reinsurers who are willing to bear the  insured risks   The buyers benefit because they can easily obtain the risk transfers that  they seek without searching for entities that would be willing to assume those risks   The owners  creditors  and reinsurers of the insurance company benefit because  the company allows them to sell their tolerance for risk easily without having to  manage the insurance contracts   Instead the company manages the relationships with  the insured primarily collections and claims and hopefully controls the various  problems fraud moral hazard and adverse selection that often plague insurance  markets   Fraud occurs when people deliberately cause or falsely report losses to col  lect on insurance  Moral hazard occurs when people are less careful about avoiding  insured losses than they would be if they were not insured so that losses occur more  often than they would otherwise  Adverse selection occurs when only those who are  most at risk buy insurance so that insured losses tend to be greater than average  Everyone benefits because insurance companies hold large diversified portfolios  of policies   Loss rates for well  diversified portfolios of insurance contracts are much  more predictable than for single contracts   For such contracts as auto insurance in  which losses are almost uncorrelated across policies  diversification ensures that the  financial performance of a large portfolio of contracts will be quite predictable and so  holding the portfolio will not be very risky  The insured benefit because they do not  have to pay the insurers much to compensate them for bearing risk  the expected loss  is quite predictable so the risk is relatively low   Instead their insurance premiums  primarily reflect the expected loss rate in the portfolio plus the costs of running and  financing the company 
4,45,    Arbitrageurs
5,45,Arbitrageurs trade when they can identify opportunities to buy and sell identical or  essentially similar instruments at different prices in different markets   They profit when  they can buy in one market for less than they sell in another market   Arbitrageurs  are financial intermediaries because they connect buyers in one market to sellers in  another market   The purest form of arbitrage involves buying and selling the same instrument in  two different markets   Arbitrageurs who do such trades sell to buyers in one market  and buy from sellers in the other market  They provide liquidity to the markets because  they make it easier for buyers and sellers to trade when and where they want to trade  Because dealers and arbitrageurs both provide liquidity to other traders  they  compete with each other  The dealers connect buyers and sellers who arrive in the  same market at different times whereas the arbitrageurs connect buyers and sellers  who arrive at the same time in different markets   In practice traders who profit  from offering liquidity rarely are purely dealers or purely arbitrageurs   Instead most  traders attempt to identify and exploit every opportunity they can to manage their  inventories profitably 
1,46,Financial Intermediaries
2,46,  
3,46,If information about prices is readily available to market participants  pure arbi  trages involving the same instrument will be quite rare  Traders who are well informed  about market conditions usually route their orders to the market offering the best  price so that arbitrageurs will have few opportunities to match traders across markets  when they want to trade the exact same instrument   Arbitrageurs often trade securities or contracts whose values depend on the same  underlying factors   For example dealers in equity option contracts often sell call options  in the contract market and buy the underlying shares in the stock market   Because  the values of the call options and of the underlying shares are closely correlated  the  value of the call increases with the value of the shares  the long stock position hedges  the risk in the short call position so that the dealer  s net position is not too risky  Similar to the pure arbitrage that involves the same instrument in different mar  kets  these arbitrage trades connect buyers in one market to sellers in another market    In this case however the buyers and sellers are interested in different instruments  whose values are closely related  In the example the buyer is interested in buying a  call options contract  the value of which is a nonlinear function of the value of the  underlying stock   the seller is interested in selling the underlying stock   Options dealers buy stock and sell calls when calls are overpriced relative to the  underlying stocks   They use complicated financial models to value options in relation  to underlying stock values  and they use financial engineering techniques to control  the risk of their portfolios   Successful arbitrageurs must know valuation relations well  and they must manage the risk in their portfolios well to trade profitably  They profit  by buying the relatively undervalued instrument and selling the relatively overvalued  instrument   Buying a risk in one form and selling it another form involves a process called  replication  Arbitrageurs use various trading strategies to replicate the returns to  securities and contracts   If they can substantially replicate those returns  they can  use the replication trading strategy to offset the risk of buying or selling the actual  securities and contracts   The combined effect of their trading is to transform risk  from one form to another  This process allows them to create or eliminate contracts  in response to the excess demand for and supply of contracts   For example when traders want to buy more call contracts than are presently  available they push the call contract prices up so that calls become overvalued relative  to the underlying stock   The arbitrageurs replicate calls by using a particular financial  engineering strategy to buy the underlying stock  and then create the desired call  option contracts by selling them short   In contrast  if more calls have been created  than traders want to hold call prices will fall so that calls become undervalued relative  to the underlying stock   The arbitrageurs will trade stocks and contracts to absorb the  excess contracts   Arbitrageurs who use these strategies are financial intermediaries  because they connect buyers and sellers who want to trade the same underlying risks  but in different forms

5,47,    Settlement and Custodial Services
6,47,In addition to connecting buyers to sellers through a variety of direct and indirect  means  financial intermediaries also help their customers settle their trades and ensure  that the resulting positions are not stolen or pledged more than once as collateral  Clearinghouses arrange for final settlement of trades   In futures markets  they  guarantee contract performance  In other markets  they may act only as escrow agents   transferring money from the buyer to the seller while transferring securities from the  seller to the buyer  The members of a clearinghouse are the only traders for whom the clearinghouse  will settle trades   To ensure that their members settle the trades that they present to  the clearinghouse clearinghouses require that their members have adequate capital  and post  performance bonds  margins   Clearinghouses also limit the aggregate net   buy minus sell  quantities that their members can settle  Brokers and dealers who are not members of the clearinghouse must arrange to  have a clearinghouse member settle their trades   To ensure that the non  member  brokers and dealers can settle their trades  clearinghouse members require that their  customers  the non  member brokers and dealers  have adequate capital and post   margins   They also limit the aggregate net quantities that their customers can settle  and they monitor their customers  trading to ensure that they do not arrange trades  that they cannot settle  Brokers and dealers similarly monitor the trades made by their retail and insti  tutional customers  and regulate their customers to ensure that they do not arrange  trades that they cannot settle  This hierarchical system of responsibility generally ensures that traders settle  their trades   The brokers and dealers guarantee settlement of the trades they arrange  for their retail and institutional customers   The clearinghouse members guarantee  settlement of the trades that their customers present to them and clearinghouses  guarantee settlement of all trades presented to them by their members   If a clearing  house member fails to settle a trade the clearinghouse settles the trade using its own  capital or capital drafted from the other members   Reliable settlement of all trades is extremely important to a well  functioning finan  cial system because it allows strangers to confidently contract with each other without  worrying too much about counterparty risk the risk that their counterparties will  not settle their trades   A secure clearinghouse system thus greatly increases liquidity  because it greatly increases the number of counterparties with whom a trader can  safely arrange a trade  In many national markets  clearinghouses clear all securities trades so that trad  ers can trade securities through any exchange broker alternative trading system or  dealer  These clearinghouse systems promote competition among these exchange  service providers   In contrast  most futures exchanges have their own clearinghouses   These clear  inghouses usually will not accept trades arranged away from their exchanges so that a  competing exchange cannot trade another exchange s contracts   Competing exchanges  may create similar contracts  but moving traders from one established market to a  new market is extraordinarily difficult because traders prefer to trade where other  traders trade

7,48,Solution 
8,48,Financial intermediaries are companies that help their clients achieve their finan  cial goals   They are called intermediaries because in some way or another they  stand between two or more people who would like to trade with each other but  for various reasons find it difficult to do so directly  The intermediary arranges  the trade for them or more often trades with both sides   For example a commercial bank is an intermediary that connects investors  with money to borrowers who need money  The investors buy certificates of  deposit from the bank  buy bonds or stock issued by the bank  or simply are  depositors in the bank   The borrowers borrow this money from the bank when  they arrange loans   Without the bank s intermediation the investors would have  to find trustworthy borrowers themselves  which would be difficult  and the  borrowers would have to find trusting lenders  which would also be difficult   Similarly an insurance company is an intermediary because it connects  customers who want to insure risks with investors who are willing to bear those  risks   The investors own shares or bonds issued by the insurance company or  they have sold reinsurance contracts to the insurance company  The insured  benefit because they can more easily buy a policy from an insurance company  than they can find counterparties who would be willing to bear their risks   The  investors benefit because the insurance company creates a diversified portfolio of  risks by selling insurance to thousands or millions of customers   Diversification  ensures that the net risk borne by the insurance company and its investors will  be predictable and thus financially manageable  In both cases  the financial intermediary also manages the relationships  with its customers and investors so that neither side has to worry about the  credit  worthiness or trust  worthiness of its counterparties   For example the  bank manages credit quality and collections on its loans and the insurance  company manages risk exposure and collections on its policies   These services  benefit both sides by reducing the costs of connecting investors to borrowers  or of insured to insurers   These are only two examples of financial intermediation  Many others involve  firms engaged in brokerage dealing  arbitrage securitization investment man  agement  and the clearing and settlement of trades   In all cases  the financial

4,49,    Summary
5,49,By facilitating transactions among buyers and sellers  financial intermediaries provide  services essential to a well  functioning financial system  They facilitate transactions  the following ways     Brokers  exchanges  and various alternative trading systems match buyers and  sellers interested in trading the same instrument at the same place and time   These financial intermediaries specialize in discovering and organizing informa  tion about who wants to trade    Dealers and arbitrageurs connect buyers to sellers interested in trading the  same instrument but who are not present at the same place and time  Dealers  connect buyers to sellers who are present at the same place but at different  times whereas arbitrageurs connect buyers to sellers who are present at the  same time but in different places   These financial intermediaries trade for their  own accounts when providing these services   Dealers buy or sell with one client  and hope to do the offsetting transaction later with another client   Arbitrageurs  buy from a seller in one market while simultaneously selling to a buyer in  another market     Many financial intermediaries create new instruments that depend on the cash  flows and associated financial risks of other instruments   The intermediaries  provide these services when they securitize assets  manage investment funds   operate banks and other finance corporations that offer investments to investors  and loans to borrowers  and operate insurance companies that pool risks   The  instruments that they create generally are more attractive to their clients than  the instruments on which they are based  The new instruments also may be  differentiated to appeal to diverse clienteles   Their efforts connect buyers of one  or more instruments to sellers of other instruments  all of which in aggregate  provide the same cash flows and risk exposures   Financial intermediaries thus  effectively arrange trades among traders who otherwise would not trade with  each other    Arbitrageurs who conduct arbitrage among securities and contracts whose  values depend on common factors convert risk from one form to another  Their  trading connects buyers and sellers who want to trade similar risks expressed in  different forms     Banks  clearinghouses  and depositories provide services that ensure traders  settle their trades and that the resulting positions are not stolen or pledged  more than once as collateral

7,49,POSITIONS
8,49,People generally solve their financial and risk management problems by taking positions  in various assets or contracts   A position in an asset is the quantity of the instrument  that an entity owns or owes   A portfolio consists of a set of positions  
1,50,Positions
2,50,  
3,50,People have long positions when they own assets or contracts   Examples of long  positions include ownership of stocks  bonds  currencies  contracts  commodities   or real assets   Long positions benefit from an appreciation in the prices of the assets  or contracts owned  People have short positions when they have sold assets that they do not own  or when they write and sell contracts   Short positions benefit from a decrease in the  prices of the assets or contracts sold  Short sellers profit by selling at high prices and  repurchasing at lower prices   Information  motivated traders sell assets and contracts  short positions when they believe that prices will fall  Hedgers also often sell instruments short  They short securities and contracts when  the financial risks inherent in the instruments are positively correlated with the risks  to which they are exposed  For example to hedge the risk associated with holding  copper inventories  a wire manufacturer would sell short copper futures   If the price  of copper falls  the manufacturer will lose on his copper inventories but gain on his  short futures position   If the risk in an instrument is inversely correlated with a risk  to which hedgers are exposed the hedgers will hedge with long positions    Contracts have long sides and short sides   The long side of a forward or futures  contract is the side that will take physical delivery or its cash equivalent  The short side  of such contracts is the side that is liable for the delivery  The long side of a futures  contract increases in value when the value of the underlying asset increases in value  The identification of the two sides can be confusing for option contracts   The  long side of an option contract is the side that holds the right to exercise the option   The short side is the side that must satisfy the obligation  Practitioners say that that  the long side holds the option and the short side writes the option so the long side  is the holder and the short side is the writer  The put contracts are the source of the  potential confusion  The put contract holder has the right to sell the underlying to  the writer  The holder will benefit if the price of the underlying falls  in which case  the price of the put contract will rise  The holder is long the put contract and has  an indirect short position in the underlying instrument   Analysts call the indirect  short position short exposure to the underlying   The put contract holders have long  exposure to their option contract and short exposure to the underlying instrument

12,50,The identification of the long side in a swap contract is often arbitrary because  swap contracts call for the exchange of contractually determined cash flows rather  than for the purchase  or the cash equivalent  of some underlying instrument   In  general the side that benefits from an increase in the quoted price is the long side  The identification of the long side in currency contracts also may be confusing    In this case the confusion stems from symmetry in the contracts   The buyer of one  currency is the seller of the other currency and vice versa for the seller  Thus  a long  forward position in one currency is a short forward position in the other currency   When practitioners describe a position they generally will say  I m long the dollar  against the yen  which means they have bought dollars and sold yen

3,51,    Short Positions
4,51,Short sellers create short positions in contracts by selling contracts that they do not  own  In a sense they become the issuers of the contract when they create the liabilities  associated with their contracts   This analogy will also help you better understand risk  when you study corporate finance  Corporations create short positions in their bonds  when they issue bonds in exchange for cash  Although bonds are generally considered  to be securities  they are also contracts between the issuer and the bondholder  Short sellers create short positions in securities by borrowing securities from secu  rity lenders who are long holders   The short sellers then sell the borrowed securities  to other traders   Short sellers close their positions by repurchasing the securities and  returning them to the security lenders   If the securities drop in value the short sellers  profit because they repurchase the securities at lower prices than the prices at which  they sold the securities   If the securities rise in value they will lose  Short sellers who  buy to close their positions are said to cover their positions   The potential gains in a long position generally are unbounded  For example the  stock prices of such highly successful companies as Yahoo  have increased more than      fold since they were first publicly traded  The potential losses on long positions   however are limited to no more than     percent a complete loss for long positions  without any associated liabilities   In contrast  the potential gains on a short position are limited to no more than       percent whereas the potential losses are unbounded  The unbounded potential  losses on short positions make short positions very risky in volatile instruments   For  example if you shorted     shares of Yahoo  in July       at     and you kept your  position open for four years  you would have lost         on your       initial  short position  During this period Yahoo  rose     fold to       on a split  adjusted  equivalent basis   Although security lenders generally believe that they are long the securities that  they lend in fact  they do not actually own the securities during the periods of their  loans   Instead they own promises made by the short sellers to return the securities    These promises are memorialized in security lending agreements   These agreements  specify that the short sellers will pay the long sellers all dividends or interest that they  otherwise would have received had they not lent their securities   These payments are  called payments  in  lieu of dividends  or of interest  and they may have different tax  treatments than actual dividends and interest   The security lending agreements also  protect the lenders in the event of a stock split   To secure the security loans  lenders require that the short seller leave the proceeds  of the short sale on deposit with them as collateral for the stock loan  They invest the  collateral in short  term securities  and they rebate the interest to the short sellers at  rates called short rebate rates   The short rebate rates are determined in the market  and generally are available only to institutional short  sellers and some large retail  traders   If a security is hard to borrow the rebate rate may be very small or even neg  ative  Such securities are said to be on special  Otherwise the rebate rate is usually     basis points less than the overnight rate in the interbank funds market   Most security  lending agreements require various margin payments to keep the credit risk among  the parties from growing when prices change  Securities lenders lend their securities because the short rebate rates they pay on  the collateral are lower than the interest rates they receive from investing the col  lateral  The difference is because of the implicit loan fees that they receive from the  borrowers for borrowing the stock   The difference also compensates lenders for risks  that the lenders take when investing the collateral and for the risk that the borrowers  will default if prices rise significantly

9,52,In many markets  traders can buy securities by borrowing some of the purchase price   They usually borrow the money from their brokers   The borrowed money is called the  margin loan and they are said to buy on margin  The interest rate that the buyers pay  for their margin loan is called the call money rate  The call money rate is above the  government bill rate and is negotiable  Large buyers generally obtain more favorable  rates than do retail buyers   For institutional  size buyers  the call money rate is quite  low because the loans are generally well secured by securities held as collateral by  the lender  Trader  s equity is that portion of the security price that the buyer must supply   Traders who buy securities on margin are subject to minimum margin requirements    The initial margin requirement is the minimum fraction of the purchase price that  must be trader  s equity  This requirement may be set by the government the exchange  or the exchange clearinghouse  For example in the United States  the Federal Reserve  Board sets the initial margin requirement through Regulation T  In Hong Kong  the  Securities and Futures Commission sets the margin requirements   In all markets   brokers often require more equity than the government  required minimum from  their clients when lending to them  Many markets allow brokers to lend their clients more money if the brokers use  risk models to measure and control the overall risk of their clients  portfolios   This  system is called portfolio margining   Buying securities on margin can greatly increase the potential gains or losses for  a given amount of equity in a position because the trader can buy more securities on  margin than he could otherwise  The buyer thus earns greater profits when prices rise  and suffers greater losses when prices fall  The relation between risk and borrowing  is called financial leverage  often simply called leverage   Traders leverage their  positions when they borrow to buy more securities   A highly leveraged position is  large relative to the equity that supports it   The leverage ratio is the ratio of the value of the position to the value of the equity  investment in it   The leverage ratio indicates how many times larger a position is than  the equity that supports it   The maximum leverage ratio associated with a position  financed by the minimum margin requirement is one divided by the minimum margin  requirement   If the requirement is     percent  then the maximum leverage ratio is             position       equity  The leverage ratio indicates how much more risky a leveraged position is relative  to an unleveraged position  For example if a stock bought on    percent margin rises      percent  the buyer will experience a     percent              return on the equity  investment in her leveraged position  But if the stock falls by    percent  the return  on the equity investment will be     percent  before the interest on the margin loan  and before payment of commissions

3,53,Financial analysts must be able to compute the total return to the equity invest  ment in a leveraged position  The total return depends on the price change of the  purchased security the dividends or interest paid by the security the interest paid on  the margin loan and the commissions paid to buy and sell the security  The following  example illustrates the computation of the total return to a leveraged purchase of  stock that pays a dividend 
4,53,EXAMPLE   
5,53,Computing Total Return to a Leveraged Stock Purchase

9,53,  What is the total return on this investment    Why is the loss greater than the    percent decrease in the market price 
10,53,Solution to   
11,53,To find the return on this investment  first determine the initial equity and then  determine the equity remaining after the sale  The total purchase price is          The leverage ratio of     indicates that the buyer  s equity financed    percent              of the purchase price  Thus  the equity investment is             of          The        remainder is borrowed  The actual investment is slightly  higher because the buyer must pay a commission of             share         shares to buy the stock   The total initial investment is        At the end of the year the stock price has declined by    share  The buyer  lost            share        shares as a result of the price change  In addition  the buyer has to pay interest at   percent on the        loan or       The buyer  also receives a dividend of       share or       The trader  s equity remaining  after the sale is computed from the initial equity investment as follows

5,54,so that the return on the initial investment of       is                              
6,54,Solution to   
7,54,The realized loss is substantially greater than the stock price return of                           Most of the difference is because of the leverage with the  remainder primarily the result of the interest paid on the loan  Based on the  leverage alone and ignoring the other cash flows  we would expect that the return  on the equity would be              leverage times the      stock price return 
8,54,In the above example if the stock dropped more than the buyer  s original    per  cent margin  ignoring commissions  interest and dividends  the trader  s equity would  have become negative  In that case the investor would owe his broker more than the  stock is worth  Brokers often lose money in such situations if the buyer does not repay  the loan out of other funds   To prevent such losses  brokers require that margin buyers always have a mini  mum amount of equity in their positions   This minimum is called the maintenance  margin requirement  It is usually     percent of the current value of the position  but it may be higher or lower depending on the volatility of the instrument and the  policies of the broker  If the value of the equity falls below the maintenance margin requirement  the  buyer will receive a margin call or request for additional equity  If the buyer does not  deposit additional equity with the broker in a timely manner the broker will close the  position to prevent further losses and thereby secure repayment of the margin loan  When you buy securities on margin you must know the price at which you will  receive a margin call if prices drop  The answer to this question depends on your  initial equity and on the maintenance margin requirement  
9,54,EXAMPLE   
10,54,Margin Call Price
11,54,A trader buys stock on margin posting    percent of the initial stock price of      as equity  The maintenance margin requirement for the position is    percent    Below what price will a margin call occur 
12,54,Solution 
13,54,The trader  s initial equity is     percent of the initial stock price of     or     per share  Subsequent changes in equity per share are equal to the share price  change so that equity per share is equal to       P       where P is the current  share price  The margin call takes place when equity drops below the    percent  maintenance margin requirement   The price below which a margin call will take  place is the solution to the following equation

4,55,which occurs at P       When the price drops below     the equity will be  under    share which is less than    percent of the price 
5,55,Traders who sell securities short are also subject to margin requirements because  they have borrowed securities   Initially the trader  s equity supporting the short posi  tion must be at least equal to the margin requirement times the initial value of the  short position  If prices rise equity will be lost   At some point  the short seller will  have to contribute additional equity to meet the maintenance margin requirement    Otherwise the broker will buy the security back to cover the short position to prevent  further losses and thereby secure repayment of the stock loan 
6,55,ORDERS
7,55,Buyers and sellers communicate with the brokers  exchanges  and dealers that arrange  their trades by issuing orders  All orders specify what instrument to trade how much  to trade and whether to buy or sell  Most orders also have other instructions attached  to them  These additional instructions may include execution instructions  validity  instructions  and clearing instructions   Execution instructions indicate how to fill  the order validity instructions indicate when the order may be filled and clearing  instructions indicate how to arrange the final settlement of the trade  In this section we introduce various order instructions and explain how traders use  them to achieve their objectives   We discuss execution mechanisms how exchanges   brokers and dealers fill orders in the next section  To understand the concepts in  this section however you need to know a little about order execution mechanisms   In most markets  dealers and various other proprietary traders often are willing  to buy from or sell to other traders seeking to sell or buy  The prices at which they  are willing to buy are called bid prices and those at which they are willing to sell are  called ask prices  or sometimes offer prices   The ask prices are invariably higher than  the bid prices   The traders who are willing to trade at various prices may also indicate the quan  tities that they will trade at those prices   These quantities are called bid sizes and ask  sizes depending on whether they are attached to bids or offers   Practitioners say that the traders who offer to trade make a market   Those who  trade with them take the market   The highest bid in the market is the best bid and the lowest ask in the market is  the best offer  The difference between the best bid and the best offer is the market  bid ask spread  When traders ask   What s the market   they want to know the best  bid and ask prices and their associated sizes   Bid ask spreads are an implicit cost of  trading   Markets with small bid ask spreads are markets in which the costs of trading  are small at least for the sizes quoted  Dealers often quote both bid and ask prices   and in that case practitioners say that they quote a two  sided market   The market  spread is never more than any dealer spread 
8,55,    Execution Instructions
9,55,Market and limit orders convey the most common execution instructions   A market  order instructs the broker or exchange to obtain the best price immediately available  when filling the order  A limit order conveys almost the same instruction  Obtain the  best price immediately available but in no event accept a price higher than a specified  limit price when buying or accept a price lower than a specified limit price when selling  
1,56,Orders
2,56,  
3,56,Many people mistakenly believe that limit orders specify the prices at which the  orders will trade  Although limit orders do often trade at their limit prices  remember  that the first instruction is to obtain the best price available  If better prices are available  than the limit price brokers and exchanges should obtain those prices for their clients   Market orders generally execute immediately if other traders are willing to take  the other side of the trade  The main drawback with market orders is that they can  be expensive to execute especially when the order is placed in a market for a thinly  traded security or more generally when the order is large relative to the normal trad  ing activity in the market   In that case a market buy order may fill at a high price or  a market sell order may fill at a low price if no traders are willing to trade at better  prices   High purchase prices and low sale prices represent price concessions given  to other traders to encourage them to take the other side of the trade  Because the  sizes of price concessions can be difficult to predict  and because prices often change  between when a trader submits an order and when the order finally fills  the execution  prices for market orders are often uncertain  Buyers and sellers who are concerned about the possibility of trading at unaccept  able prices add limit price instructions to their orders   The main problem with limit  orders is that they may not execute  Limit orders do not execute if the limit price on  a buy order is too low or if the limit price on a sell order is too high  For example if  an investment manager submits a limit order to buy at the limit price of     buy limit      and nobody is willing to sell at or below    the order will not trade  If prices never  drop to    the manager will never buy  If the price subsequently rises  the manager  will have lost the opportunity to profit from the price rise  Whether traders use market orders or limit orders when trying to arrange trades  depends on their concerns about price trading quickly and failing to trade  On average  limit orders trade at better prices than do market orders  but they often do not trade   Traders generally regret when their limit orders fail to trade because they usually  would have profited if they had traded  Limit buy orders do not fill when prices are  rising  and limit sell orders do not fill when prices are falling   In both cases  traders  would be better off if their orders had filled  The probability that a limit order will execute depends on where the order is placed  relative to market prices   An aggressively priced order is more likely to trade than is a  less aggressively priced order  A limit buy order is aggressively priced when the limit  price is high relative to the market bid and ask prices   If the limit price is placed above  the best offer the buy order generally will partially or completely fill at the best offer  price depending on the size available at the best offer  Such limit orders are called  marketable limit orders because at least part of the order can trade immediately  A  limit buy order with a very high price relative to the market is essentially a market order  If the buy order is placed above the best bid but below the best offer traders say the  order makes a new market because it becomes the new best bid  Such orders generally  will not immediately trade but they may attract sellers who are interested in trading    A buy order placed at the best bid is said to make market   It may have to wait until  all other buy orders at that price trade first   Finally a buy order placed below the best  bid is behind the market  It will not execute unless market prices drop  Traders call  limit orders that are waiting to trade standing limit orders  Sell limit orders are aggressively priced if the limit price is low relative to market  prices   The limit price of a marketable sell limit order is below the best bid  A limit  sell order placed between the best bid and the best offer makes a new market on the  sell side one placed at the best offer makes market  and one placed above the best  offer is behind the market   Exhibit    presents a simplified limit order book in which orders are presented  ranked by their limit prices for a hypothetical market   The market is     bid offered  at     because the best bid is    and the best offer  ask  is

24,57,Solution to

26,57,A trade  off exists between how aggressively priced an order is and the ultimate  trade price  Although aggressively priced orders fill faster and with more certainty then  do less aggressively priced limit orders  the prices at which they execute are inferior

3,58,Buyers seeking to trade quickly must pay higher prices to increase the probability of  trading quickly  Similarly sellers seeking to trade quickly must accept lower prices to  increase the probability of trading quickly  Some order execution instructions specify conditions on size  For example all  or   nothing  AON  orders can only trade if their entire sizes can be traded  Traders can  similarly specify minimum fill sizes   This specification is common when settlement  costs depend on the number of trades made to fill an order and not on the aggregate  size of the order  Exposure instructions indicate whether how and perhaps to whom orders should  be exposed  Hidden orders are exposed only to the brokers or exchanges that receive  them  These agencies cannot disclose hidden orders to other traders until they can fill  them  Traders use hidden orders when they are afraid that other traders might behave  strategically if they knew that a large order was in the market   Traders can discover  hidden size only by submitting orders that will trade with that size  Thus  traders can  only learn about hidden size after they have committed to trading with it   Traders also often indicate a specific display size for their orders   Brokers and  exchanges then expose only the display size for these orders   Any additional size is  hidden from the public but can be filled if a suitably large order arrives   Traders some  times call such orders iceberg orders because most of the order is hidden  Traders  specify display sizes when they do not want to display their full sizes  but still want  other traders to know that someone is willing to trade at the displayed price  Traders  on the opposite side who wish to trade additional size at that price can discover the  hidden size only if they trade the displayed size at which point the broker or exchange  will display any remaining size up to the display size  They also can discover the hidden  size by submitting large orders that will trade with that size 
4,58,EXAMPLE   
5,58,Market versus Limit and Hidden versus Displayed Orders
6,58,You are the buy  side trader for a very clever investment manager  The manager  has hired a commercial satellite firm to take regular pictures of the parking lots  in which new car dealers store their inventories   It has also hired some part  time  workers to count the cars on the lots   With this information and some econo  metric analyses  the manager can predict weekly new car sale announcements  more accurately than can most analysts   The manager typically makes a quarter  percent each week on this strategy  Once a week  a day before the announcements  are made the manager gives you large orders to buy or sell car manufacturers  based on his insights into their dealers  sales   What primary issues should you  consider when deciding whether to    use market or limit orders to fill his orders    display the orders or hide them 
7,58,Solution to   
8,58,The manager  s information is quite perishable  If his orders are not filled before  the weekly sales are reported to the public the manager will lose the opportunity  to profit from the information as prices immediately adjust to the news   The  manager therefore needs to get the orders filled quickly  This consideration  suggests that the orders should be submitted as market orders   If submitted as  limit orders  the orders might not execute and the firm would lose the oppor  tunity to profit  
1,59,  
2,59,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,59,Large market orders  however can be very expensive to execute especially  if few people are willing to trade significant size on the other side of the market    Because transaction costs can easily exceed the expected quarter percent return  you should submit limit orders to limit the execution prices that you are willing  to accept   It is better to fail to trade than to trade at losing prices  
4,59,Solution to   
5,59,Your large orders could easily move the market if many people were aware of  them and even more so if others were aware that you are trading on behalf of a  successful information  motivated trader  You thus should consider submitting  hidden orders   The disadvantage of hidden orders is that they do not let people  know that they can trade the other side if they want to 
6,59,    Validity Instructions
7,59,Validity instructions indicate when an order may be filled  The most common validity  instruction is the day order  A day order is good for the day on which it is submitted   If it has not been filled by the close of business  the order expires unfilled  Good  till  cancelled orders  GTC  are just that   In practice most brokers limit  how long they will manage an order to ensure that they do not fill orders that their  clients have forgotten  Such brokers may limit their GTC orders to a few months   Immediate or cancel orders  IOC  are good only upon receipt by the broker or  exchange  If they cannot be filled in part or in whole they cancel immediately  In  some markets these orders are also known as fill or kill orders   When searching for  hidden liquidity electronic algorithmic trading systems often submit thousands of  these IOC orders for every order that they fill  Good  on  close orders can only be filled at the close of trading   These orders often  are market orders  so traders call them market  on  close orders   Traders often use on   close orders when they want to trade at the same prices that will be published as the  closing prices of the day  Mutual funds often like to trade at such prices because they  value their portfolios at closing prices   Many traders also use good  on  open orders  
8,59,      Stop Orders
9,59,A stop order is an order in which a trader has specified a stop price condition  The  stop order may not be filled until the stop price condition has been satisfied  For a sell  order the stop price condition suspends execution of the order until a trade occurs at  or below the stop price  After that trade the stop condition is satisfied and the order  becomes valid for execution subject to all other execution instructions attached to  it   If the market price subsequently rises above the sell order  s stop price before the  order trades  the order remains valid  Similarly a buy order with a stop condition  becomes valid only after a price rises above the specified stop price  Traders often call stop orders stop  loss orders because many traders use them  with the hope of stopping losses on positions that they have established  For example  a trader who has bought stock at    may want to sell the stock if the price falls below      In that case the trader might submit a  GTC  stop    market sell  order  If the  price falls to or below    the market order becomes valid and it should immediately  execute at the best price then available in the market   That price may be substantially  lower than    if the market is falling quickly  The stop  loss order thus does not guar  antee a stop to losses at the stop price  If potential sellers are worried about trading at  too low of a price they can attach stop instructions to limit orders instead of market  orders   In this example if the trader is unwilling to sell below    the trader would  submit a  GTC  stop    limit    sell  order 
1,60,Orders
2,60,  
3,60,If a trader wants to guarantee that he can sell at    the trader would buy a put  option contract struck at     The purchase price of the option would include a premium  for the insurance that the trader is buying   Option contracts can be viewed as limit  orders for which execution is guaranteed at the strike price  A trader similarly might  use a stop  buy order or a call option to limit losses on a short position  A portfolio manager might use a stop  buy order when the manager believes that  a security is undervalued but is unwilling to trade without market confirmation  For  example suppose that a stock currently trades for    RMB and a manager believes  that it should be worth     RMB  Further the manager believes that the stock will  much more likely be worth     RMB if other traders are willing to buy it above     RMB  To best take advantage of this information the manager would consider issuing  a  GTC  stop    RMB limit     RMB buy   order  Note that if the manager relies too  much on the market when making this trading decision however he may violate CFA  Standard of Professional Conduct V A    which requires that all investment actions have  a reasonable and adequate basis supported by appropriate research and investigation  Because stop  sell orders become valid when prices are falling and stop  buy orders  become valid when prices are rising  traders using stop orders contribute to market  momentum as their sell orders push prices down further and their buy orders push  prices up  Execution prices for stop orders thus are often quite poor 
4,60,EXAMPLE   
5,60,Limit and Stop Instructions
6,60,In what ways do limit and stop instructions differ 
7,60,Solution 
8,60,Although both limit and stop instructions specify prices  the role that these  prices play in the arrangement of a trade are completely different   A limit price  places a limit on what trade prices will be acceptable to the trader  A buyer will  accept prices only at or lower than the limit price whereas a seller will accept  prices only at or above the limit price  In contrast  a stop price indicates when an order can be filled  A buy order  can only be filled once the market has traded at a price at or above the stop  price  A sell order can only be filled once the market has traded at a price at or  below the stop price  Both order instructions may delay or prevent the execution of an order  A  buy limit order will not execute until someone is willing to sell at or below the  limit price  Similarly a sell limit order will not execute until someone is willing to  buy at or above the limit sell price  In contrast  a stop  buy order will not execute  if the market price never rises to the stop price  Similarly a stop  sell order will  not execute if the market price never falls to the stop price 
9,60,    Clearing Instructions
10,60,Clearing instructions tell brokers and exchanges how to arrange final settlement  of trades   Traders generally do not attach these instructions to each order instead  they provide them as standing instructions   These instructions indicate what entity  is responsible for clearing and settling the trade  For retail trades  that entity is the  customer  s broker  For institutional trades  that entity may be a custodian or another  broker  When a client uses one broker to arrange trades and another broker to settle  trades  traders say that the first broker gives up the trade to the other broker who  is often known as the prime broker  Institutional traders provide these instructions

3,61, 
4,61,so they can obtain specialized execution services from different brokers while main  taining a single account for custodial services and other prime brokerage services   such as margin loans   An important clearing instruction that must appear on security sale orders is an  indication of whether the sale is a long sale or a short sale  In either case the broker  representing the sell order must ensure that the trader can deliver securities for set  tlement   For a long sale the broker must confirm that the securities held are available  for delivery  For a short sale the broker must either borrow the security on behalf of  the client or confirm that the client can borrow the security 
5,61,PRIMARY SECURITY MARKETS
6,61,When issuers first sell their securities to investors  practitioners say that the trades  take place in the primary markets  An issuer makes an initial public offering  IPO   sometimes called a placing of a security issue when it sells the security to the public  for the first time  A seasoned security is a security that an issuer has already issued   If the issuer wants to sell additional units of a previously issued security it makes a  seasoned offering  sometimes called a secondary offering   Both types of offerings  occur in the primary market where issuers sell their securities to investors   Later if  investors trade these securities among themselves  they trade in secondary markets   This section discusses primary markets and the procedures that issuers use to offer  their securities to the public 
7,61,    Public Offerings
8,61,Corporations generally contract with an investment bank to help them sell their secu  rities to the public  The investment bank then lines up subscribers who will buy the  security  Investment bankers call this process book building  In London the book  builder is called the book runner  The bank tries to build a book of orders to which  they can sell the offering   Investment banks often support their book building by  providing investment information and opinion about the issuer to their clients and to  the public  Before the offering  the issuer generally makes a very detailed disclosure  of its business  of the risks inherent in it  and of the uses to which the new funds will  be placed  When time is of the essence issuers in Europe may issue securities through an  accelerated book build in which the investment bank arranges the offering in only  one or two days   Such sales often occur at discounted prices   The first public offering of common stock in a company consists of newly issued  shares to be sold by the company  It may also include shares that the founders and  other early investors in the company seek to sell  The initial public offering provides  these investors with a means of liquidating their investments   In an underwritten offering the most common type of offering the investment  bank guarantees the sale of the issue at an offering price that it negotiates with the  issuer  If the issue is undersubscribed the bank will buy whatever securities it cannot  sell at the offering price  In the case of an IPO the underwriter usually also promises to  make a market in the security for about a month to ensure that the secondary market  will be liquid and to provide price support if necessary  For large issues  a syndicate of  investment banks and broker dealers helps the lead underwriter build the book   The  issuer usually pays an underwriting fee of about   percent for these various services    The underwriting fee is a placement cost of the offering

3,62,In a best effort offering the investment bank acts only as broker  If the offering  is undersubscribed the issuer will not sell as much as it hoped to sell  For both types of offerings  the issuer and the bank usually jointly set the offering  price following a negotiation  If they set a price that buyers consider too high the  offering will be undersubscribed and they will fail to sell the entire issue  If they set  the price too low the offering will be oversubscribed in which case the securities are  often allocated to preferred clients or on a pro  rata basis    Note that CFA Standard of Professional Conduct III B fair dealing requires  that the allocation be based on a written policy disclosed to clients and suggests that  the securities be offered on a pro  rata basis among all clients who have comparable  relationships with their broker dealers    Investment banks have a conflict of interest with respect to the offering price  in underwritten offerings   As agents for the issuers  they generally are supposed to  select the offering price that will raise the most money  But as underwriters  they  have strong incentives to choose a low price  If the price is low the banks can allocate  valuable shares to benefit their clients and thereby indirectly benefit the banks   If the  price is too high the underwriters will have to buy overvalued shares in the offering  and perhaps also during the following month if they must support the price in the  secondary market  which directly costs the banks   These considerations tend to lower  initial offering prices so that prices in the secondary market often rise immediately  following an IPO  They are less important in a seasoned offering because trading in  the secondary market helps identify the proper price for the offering   First time issuers generally accept lower offering prices because they and many  others believe that an undersubscribed IPO conveys very unfavorable information  to the market about the company  s prospects at a time when it is most vulnerable to  public opinion about its prospects   They fear that an undersubscribed initial public  offering will make it substantially harder to raise additional capital in subsequent  seasoned offerings

5,62,The Playtech Initial Public Offering
6,62,Playtech is a designer developer and licensor of software for the gambling  industry  On    March      Playtech raised approximately      million gross  through an initial public offering of           ordinary shares at       per  ordinary share  After the initial public offering  Playtech had           ordi  nary shares issued and outstanding   Playtech received gross proceeds of approximately        million and net  proceeds of        million  The ordinary shares that were sold to the public  represented approximately    percent of Playtech s total issued ordinary shares   The shares commenced trading at      AM on the AIM market of the London  Stock Exchange where Playtech opened at       traded    million shares between        and       and closed at          Approximately how many new shares were issued by the company and  how many shares were sold by the company  s founders  What fraction of  their holdings in the company did the founders sell    Approximately what return did the subscribers who participated in the  IPO make on the first day it traded    Approximately how much did Playtech pay in placement costs as a per  centage of the new funds raised

15,63,    Private Placements and Other Primary Market Transactions
16,63,Corporations sometimes issue their securities in private placements   In a private  placement corporations sell securities directly to a small group of qualified investors   usually with the assistance of an investment bank   Qualified investors have sufficient  knowledge and experience to recognize the risks that they assume and sufficient  wealth to assume those risks responsibly  Most countries allow corporations to do  private placements without nearly as much public disclosure as is required for public  offerings   Private placements  therefore may be cheaper than public offerings  but the  buyers generally require higher returns  lower purchase prices  because they cannot  subsequently trade the securities in an organized secondary market   Corporations sometimes sell new issues of seasoned securities directly to the public  on a piecemeal basis via a shelf registration  In a shelf registration the corporation  makes all public disclosures that it would for a regular offering  but it does not sell the  shares in a single transaction  Instead it sells the shares directly into the secondary  market over time generally when it needs additional capital  Shelf registrations provide  corporations with flexibility in the timing of their capital transactions  and they can  alleviate the downward price pressures often associated with large secondary offerings   Many corporations may also issue shares via dividend reinvestment plans  DRPs  or DRIPs  for short  that allow their shareholders to reinvest their dividends in newly  issued shares of the corporation  in particular DRPs specify that the corporation issue  new shares for the plan rather than purchase them on the open market   These plans  sometimes also allow existing shareholders and other investors to buy additional stock  at a slight discount to current prices   Finally corporations can issue new stock via a rights offering   In a rights offering   the corporation distributes rights to buy stock at a fixed price to existing sharehold  ers in proportion to their holdings   Because the rights need not be exercised they  are options   The exercise price however is set below the current market price of the  stock so that buying stock with the rights is immediately profitable  Consequently  shareholders will experience dilution in the value of their existing shares   They can  offset the dilution loss by exercising their rights or by selling the rights to others who  will exercise them  Shareholders generally do not like rights offerings because they  must provide additional capital  or sell their rights  to avoid losses through dilution   Financial analysts recognize that these securities  although called rights  are actually  short  term stock warrants and value them accordingly

3,64,The national governments of financially strong countries generally issue their  bonds  notes  and bills in public auctions organized by a government agency  usually  associated with the finance ministry   They may also sell them directly to dealers   Smaller and less financially secure national governments and most regional gov  ernments often contract with investment banks to help them sell and distribute their  securities   The laws of many governments  however require that they auction their  securities

5,64,Private and Public Placements
6,64,In what ways do private placements differ from public placements 
7,64,Solution 
8,64,Issuers make private placements to a limited number of investors that generally  are financially sophisticated and well informed about risk   The investors gener  ally have some relationship to the issuer  Issuers make public placements when  they sell securities to the general public  Public placements generally require  substantially more financial disclosure than do private placements  
9,64,    Importance of Secondary Markets to Primary Markets
10,64,Corporations and governments can raise money in the primary markets at lower cost  when their securities will trade in liquid secondary markets   In a liquid market trad  ers can buy or sell with low transaction costs and small price concessions when they  want to trade  Buyers value liquidity because they may need to sell their securities to  meet liquidity needs   Investors thus will pay more for securities that they can easily  sell than for those that they cannot easily sell  Higher prices translate into lower costs  of capital for the issuers  
11,64,SECONDARY SECURITY MARKET AND CONTRACT  MARKET STRUCTURES
12,64, 
13,64,Trading is the successful outcome to a bilateral search in which buyers look for sellers  and sellers look for buyers   Many market structures have developed to reduce the costs  of this search  Markets are liquid when the costs of finding a suitable counterparty  to a trade are low  Trading in securities and contracts takes place in a variety of market structures    The structures differ by when trades can be arranged who arranges the trades  how  they do so and how traders learn about possible trading opportunities and executed  trades   This section introduces the various market structures used to trade securities  and contracts   We first consider trading sessions  then execution mechanisms  and  finally market information systems

3,65,    Trading Sessions
4,65,Markets are organized as call markets or as continuous trading markets   In a call  market trades can be arranged only when the market is called at a particular time  and place  In contrast in a continuous trading market trades can be arranged and  executed anytime the market is open  Buyers can easily find sellers and vice versa in call markets because all traders  interested in trading  or orders representing their interests  are present at the same  time and place  Call markets thus have the potential to be very liquid when they are  called  But they are completely illiquid between trading sessions   In contrast  traders  can arrange and execute their trades at anytime in continuous trading markets  but  doing so can be difficult if the buyers and sellers  or their orders  are not both present  at the same time  Most call markets use single price auctions to match buyers to sellers   In these  auctions  the market constructs order books representing all buy orders and all seller  orders   The market then chooses a single trade price that will maximize the total  volume of trade  The order books are supply and demand schedules  and the point at  which they cross determines the trade price  Call markets usually are organized just once a day but some markets organize  calls at more frequent intervals   Many continuous trading markets start their trading with a call market auction   During a pre  opening period traders submit their orders for the market call  At the  opening  any possible trades are arranged and then trading continues in the contin  uous trading session  Some continuous trading markets also close their trading with  a call  In these markets  traders who are only interested in trading in the closing call  submit market  or limit  on  close orders

8,65,Solution to   
9,65,By gathering all traders to the same place at the same time a call market makes  it easier for buyers to find sellers and vice versa   In contrast  if buyers and sellers   or their orders  are not present at the same time in a continuous market  they  cannot trade 
10,65,Solution to   
11,65,In a continuous trading market  a willing buyer and seller can trade at any time  the market is open  In contrast  in a call market trading can take place only  when the market is called 
12,65,    Execution Mechanisms
13,65,The three main types of market structures are quote  driven markets  sometimes called  price  driven or dealer markets  order  driven markets  and brokered markets   In quote   driven markets customers trade with dealers   In order  driven markets an order  matching system run by an exchange a broker or an alternative trading system uses
1,66,Secondary Security Market and Contract Market Structures
2,66,  
3,66,rules to arrange trades based on the orders that traders submit   Most exchanges and  ECNs organize order  driven markets   In brokered markets brokers arrange trades  between their customers   Brokered markets are common for transactions of unique  instruments  such as real estate properties  intellectual properties  or large blocks of  securities   Many trading systems use more than one type of market structure 
4,66,      Quote  Driven Markets
5,66,Worldwide most trading  other than in stocks  takes place in quote  driven markets    Almost all bonds and currencies and most spot commodities trade in quote  driven  markets   Traders call them quote  driven  or price  driven or dealer  because custom  ers trade at the prices quoted by dealers   Depending on the instrument traded the  dealers work for commercial banks  for investment banks  for broker dealers  or for  proprietary trading houses   Quote  driven markets also often are called over  the  counter  OTC  markets  because securities used to be literally traded over the dealer  s counter in the dealer  s  office  Now most trades in OTC markets are conducted over proprietary computer  communications networks  by telephone or sometimes over instant messaging systems  
6,66,      Order  Driven Markets
7,66,Order  driven markets arrange trades using rules to match buy orders to sell orders    The orders may be submitted by customers or by dealers   Almost all exchanges use  order  driven trading systems  and every automated trading system is an order  driven  system  Because rules match buyers to sellers  traders often trade with complete strangers    Order  driven markets thus must have procedures to ensure that buyers and sellers per  form on their trade contracts   Otherwise dishonest traders would enter contracts that  they would not settle if a change in market conditions made settlement unprofitable  Two sets of rules characterize order  driven market mechanisms   Order matching  rules and trade pricing rules   The order matching rules match buy orders to sell orders    The trade pricing rules determine the prices at which the matched trades take place          Order Matching Rules Order  driven trading systems match buyers to sellers  using rules that rank the buy orders and the sell orders based on price and often along  with other secondary criteria  The systems then match the highest ranking buy order  with the highest ranking sell order  If the buyer is willing to pay at least as much as  the seller is willing to receive the system will arrange a trade for the minimum of the  buy and sell quantities   The remaining size if any is then matched with the next order  on the other side and the process continues until no further trades can be arranged  The order precedence hierarchy determines which orders go first  The first rule is  price priority  The highest priced buy orders and the lowest priced sell orders go first    They are the most aggressively priced orders   Secondary precedence rules determine  how to rank orders at the same price  Most trading systems use time precedence to  rank orders at the same price  The first order to arrive has precedence over other  orders   In trading systems that permit hidden and partially hidden orders  displayed  quantities at a given price generally have precedence over the undisplayed quantities    So the complete precedence hierarchy is given by price priority display precedence  at a given price and finally time precedence among all orders with the same display  status at a given price  These rules give traders incentives to improve price display  their orders  and arrive early if they want to trade quickly  These incentives increase  market liquidity 
1,67,  
2,67,Reading      Market Organization and Structure
3,67,        Trade Pricing Rules After the orders are matched the trading system then  uses its trade pricing rule to determine the trade price  The three rules that various  order  driven markets use to price their trades are the uniform pricing rule the dis  criminatory pricing rule and the derivative pricing rule  Call markets commonly use the uniform pricing rule  Under this rule all trades  execute at the same price  The market chooses the price that maximizes the total  quantity traded  Continuous trading markets use the discriminatory pricing rule  Under this rule  the limit price of the order or quote that first arrived the standing order determines  the trade price  This rule allows a large arriving trader to discriminate among standing  limit orders by filling the most aggressively priced orders first at their limit prices and  then filling less aggressively priced orders at their less favorable  from the point of  view of the arriving trader  limit prices   If trading systems did not use this pricing rule  large traders would break their orders into pieces to price discriminate on their own

18,67,Solution 
19,67,Tsubasa s buy order first fills with the most aggressively priced sell order which  is Hina s order for four contracts   A trade takes place at        for four contracts   Hina s order fills completely and Tsubasa still has    more contracts remaining   The next most aggressively priced sell order is Sakur  s order for six contracts    A second trade takes place at        for six contracts  Sakur  s order fills com  pletely and Tsubasa still has five more contracts remaining   The next most aggressively priced sell order is Miku s order at         No  further trade is possible however because her limit sell price is above Tsubasa s  limit buy price  Tsubasa s average trade price is     Because Tsubasa issued a day order the remainder of his order is placed on  the book on the buy side at         The following orders are then on the book

14,68,Crossing networks use the derivative pricing rule  Crossing networks are trading  systems that match buyers and sellers who are willing to trade at prices obtained  from other markets   Most systems cross their trades at the midpoint of the best bid  and ask quotes published by the exchange at which the security primarily trades    This pricing rule is called a derivative pricing rule because the price is derived from  another market   In particular the price does not depend on the orders submitted  to the crossing network   Some crossing networks are organized as call markets and  others as continuously trading markets   The most important crossing market is the  equity trading system POSIT 
15,68,      Brokered Markets
16,68,The third execution mechanism is the brokered market in which brokers arrange  trades among their clients   Brokers organize markets for instruments for which finding  a buyer or a seller willing to trade is difficult because the instruments are unique and  thus of interest only to a limited number of people or institutions   These instruments  generally are also infrequently traded and expensive to carry in inventory  Examples  of such instruments include very large blocks of stock  real estate properties  fine art  masterpieces  intellectual properties  operating companies  liquor licenses  and taxi  medallions   Because dealers generally are unable or unwilling to hold these assets  in their inventories  they will not make markets in them  Organizing order  driven  markets for these instruments is not sensible because too few traders would submit  orders to them  Successful brokers in these markets try to know everyone who might now or in  the future be willing to trade  They spend most of their time on the telephone and in  meetings building their networks

4,69,    Market Information Systems
5,69,Markets vary in the type and quantity of data that they disseminate to the public   Traders say that a market is pre  trade transparent if the market publishes real  time  data about quotes and orders   Markets are post  trade transparent if the market pub  lishes trade prices and sizes soon after trades occur  Buy  side traders value transparency because it allows them to better manage their  trading  understand market values  and estimate their prospective and actual transac  tion costs   In contrast  dealers prefer to trade in opaque markets because as frequent  traders  they have an information advantage over those who know less than they do   Bid ask spreads tend to be wider and transaction costs tend to be higher in opaque  markets because finding the best available price is harder for traders in such markets  
6,69,WELL  FUNCTIONING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
7,69,The financial system allows traders to solve financing and risk management problems    In a well  functioning financial system     investors can easily move money from the present to the future while obtaining  a fair rate of return for the risks that they bear      borrowers can easily obtain funds that they need to undertake current projects  if they can credibly promise to repay the funds in the future     hedgers can easily trade away or offset the risks that concern them  and    traders can easily trade currencies for other currencies or commodities that  they need  If the assets or contracts needed to solve these problems are available to trade  the financial system has complete markets  If the costs of arranging these trades are  low the financial system is operationally efficient  If the prices of the assets and  contracts reflect all available information related to fundamental values  the financial  system is informationally efficient   Well  functioning financial systems are characterized by      the existence of well  developed markets that trade instruments that help people  solve their financial problems  complete markets      liquid markets in which the costs of trading commissions  bid ask spreads   and order price impacts are low  operationally efficient markets      timely financial disclosures by corporations and governments that allow market  participants to estimate the fundamental values of securities  support informa 
8,69,tionally efficient markets   and
9,69,   prices that reflect fundamental values so that prices vary primarily in response  to changes in fundamental values and not to demands for liquidity made by  uninformed traders  informationally efficient markets   Such complete and operationally efficient markets are produced by financial inter  mediaries who     organize exchanges  brokerages  and alternative trading systems that match  buyers to sellers      provide liquidity on demand to traders      securitize assets to produce investment instruments that are attractive to inves  tors and thereby lower the costs of funds for borrowers

10,71,Government agencies and practitioner organizations regulate many markets and the  financial intermediaries that participate in them  The regulators generally seek to  promote fair and orderly markets in which traders can trade at prices that accurately  reflect fundamental values without incurring excessive transaction costs   This section  identifies the problems that financial regulators hope to solve and the objectives of  their regulations   Regrettably some people will steal from each other if given a chance especially if  the probability of detection is low or if the penalty for being caught is low  The number  of ways that people can steal or misappropriate wealth generally increases with the  complexity of their relationships and with asymmetries in their knowledge  Because
1,72,Market Regulation
2,72,  
3,72,financial markets tend to be complex  and because customers are often much less  sophisticated than the professionals that serve them the potential for losses through  various frauds can be unacceptably high in unregulated markets   Regulators thus ensure that systems are in place to protect customers from fraud   In principle the customers themselves would demand such systems as a condition of  doing business   When customers are unsophisticated or poorly informed however they  may not know how to protect themselves   When the costs of learning are large as  they often are in complex financial markets having regulators look out for the public  interest can be economically efficient   More customer money is probably lost in financial markets through negligence  than through outright fraud  Most customers in financial markets use various agents  to help them solve problems that they do not understand well  These agents include  securities brokers  financial advisers  investment managers  and insurance agents    Because customers generally do not have much information about market condi  tions  they find it extremely difficult to measure the added value they obtain from  their agents   This problem is especially challenging when performance has a strong  random component   In that case determining whether agents are skilled or lucky is  very difficult   Moreover if the agent is a good salesman the customer may not criti  cally evaluate their agent s performance  These conditions  which characterize most  financial markets  ensure that customers cannot easily determine whether their agents  are working faithfully for them  They tend to lose if their agents are unqualified or  lazy or if they unconsciously favor themselves and their friends over their clients  as  is natural for even the most honest people  Regulators help solve these agency problems by setting minimum standards of  competence for agents and by defining and enforcing minimum standards of practice   CFA Institute provides significant standard setting leadership in the areas of investment  management and investment performance reporting through its Chartered Financial  Analyst Program in which you are studying  and its Global Investment Performance  Standards   In principle regulation would not be necessary if customers could identify  competent agents and effectively measure their performance  In the financial markets   doing so is very difficult   Regulators often act to level the playing field for market participants   For example  in many jurisdictions  insider trading in securities is illegal  The rule prevents corporate  insiders and others with access to corporate information from trading on material  information that has not been released to the public  The purpose of the rule is to  reduce the profits that insiders could extract from the markets   These profits would  come from other traders who would lose when they trade with well  informed insiders    Because traders tend to withdraw from markets when they lose rules against insider  trading help keep markets liquid  They also keep corporate insiders from hoarding  information  Many situations arise in financial markets in which common standards benefit  everyone involved  For example having all companies report financial results on a  common basis allows financial analysts to easily compare companies   Accordingly  the International Accounting Standards Board  IASB  and the US   based Financial  Accounting Standards Board among many others  promulgate common financial stan  dards to which all companies must report   The benefits of having common reporting  standards has led to a very successful and continuing effort to converge all accounting  standards to a single worldwide standard  Without such regulations  investors might  eventually refuse to invest in companies that do not report to a common standard  but such market  based discipline is a very slow regulator of behavior and it would  have little effect on companies that do not need to raise new capital  Regulators generally require that financial firms maintain minimum levels of capital   These capital requirements serve two purposes   First  they ensure that the compa  nies will be able to honor their contractual commitments when unexpected market

5,74,You are the chief executive officer of a brokerage that is a member of a clear  inghouse  A trader who clears through your firm is bankrupt at midday but you  do not yet know it even though your clearing agreement with him explicitly  requires that he immediately report significant losses   The trader knows that  if he takes a large position prices might move in his favor so that he will no  longer be bankrupt   The trader attempts to do so and succeeds   You find out  about this later in the evening     Why does the clearinghouse regulate its members    What should you do about the trader    Why would the clearinghouse allow you to keep his trading profits 
6,74,Solution to   
7,74,The clearinghouse regulates its members to ensure that no member imposes  costs on another member by failing to settle a trade

13,74,This reading introduces how the financial system operates and explains how well   functioning financial systems lead to wealthy economies   Financial analysts need  to understand how the financial system works because their analyses often lead to  trading decisions   The financial system consists of markets and the financial intermediaries that  operate in them  These institutions allow buyers to connect with sellers   They may  trade directly with each other when they trade the same instrument or they only  may trade indirectly when a financial intermediary connects the buyer to the seller  through transactions with each that appear on the intermediary  s balance sheet   The  buyer and seller may exchange instruments  cash flows  or risks   The following points  among others  were made in this reading     The financial system consists of mechanisms that allow strangers to contract  with each other to move money through time to hedge risks  and to exchange  assets that they value less for those that they value more     Investors move money from the present to the future when they save  They  expect a normal rate of return for bearing risk through time  Borrowers  move money from the future to the present to fund current projects and

9,89,INDEX DEFINITION AND CALCULATIONS OF VALUE  AND RETURNS
10,89,A security market index represents a given security market market segment or asset  class   Most indexes are constructed as portfolios of marketable securities   The value of an index is calculated on a regular basis using either the actual or  estimated market prices of the individual securities  known as constituent securities  within the index  For each security market index investors may encounter two versions  of the same index  i e  an index with identical constituent securities and weights    one version based on price return and one version based on total return  As the name  suggests  a price return index also known as a price index reflects only the prices of  the constituent securities within the index   A total return index in contrast  reflects  not only the prices of the constituent securities but also the reinvestment of all income  received since inception

3,90,At inception the values of the price and total return versions of an index are  equal  As time passes  however the value of the total return index  which includes  the reinvestment of all dividends and or interest received will exceed the value of the  price return index by an increasing amount   A look at how the values of each version  are calculated over multiple periods illustrates why  The value of a price return index is calculated as

11,90,    Calculation of Single  Period Returns
12,90,For a security market index  price return can be calculated in two ways   either the  percentage change in value of the price return index  or the weighted average of price  returns of the constituent securities   The price return of an index can be expressed as

37,92,    Calculation of Index Values over Multiple Time Periods
38,92,The calculation of index values over multiple time periods requires geometrically  linking the series of index returns   With a series of price returns for an index  we can  calculate the value of the price return index with the following equation  VPRIT   VPRI       PRI        PRI         PRIT    where  VPRI     the value of the price return index at inception  VPRIT   the value of the price return index at time t PRIT   the price return  as a decimal number  on the index over period t t          T For an index with an inception value set to      and price returns of    percent  and    percent for Periods   and   respectively the values of the price return index  would be calculated as follows

12,93,As illustrated above as time passes  the value of the total return index  which  includes the reinvestment of all dividends and or interest received exceeds the value  of the price return index by an increasing amount  
13,93,INDEX CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT
14,93,Constructing and managing a security market index is similar to constructing and  managing a portfolio of securities   Index providers must decide the following    Which target market should the index represent    Which securities should be selected from that target market    How much weight should be allocated to each security in the index    When should the index be rebalanced    When should the security selection and weighting decision be re  examined 
15,93,    Target Market and Security Selection
16,93,The first decision in index construction is identifying the target market  market seg  ment  or asset class that the index is intended to represent   The target market may  be defined very broadly or narrowly  It may be based on asset class  e g   equities   fixed income real estate commodities  hedge funds   geographic region  e g   Japan  South Africa  Latin America  Europe   the exchange on which the securities are traded   e g   Shanghai Toronto Tokyo  and or other characteristics  e g   economic sector  company size investment style duration or credit quality   The target market determines the investment universe and the securities available  for inclusion in the index   Once the investment universe is identified the number of  securities and the specific securities to include in the index must be determined  The  constituent securities could be nearly all those in the target market or a representative  sample of the target market   Some equity indexes  such as the S P     Index and the  FTSE     fix the number of securities included in the index and indicate this number  in the name of the index   Other indexes allow the number of securities to vary to  reflect changes in the target market or to maintain a certain percentage of the target  market  For example the Tokyo Stock Price Index  TOPIX  represents and includes all  of the largest stocks  known as the First Section listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange   To be included in the First Section and thus the TOPIX stocks must meet certain  criteria  such as the number of shares outstanding  the number of shareholders  and  market capitalization  Stocks that no longer meet the criteria are removed from the  First Section and also the TOPIX  Objective or mechanical rules determine the con  stituent securities of most  but not all indexes   The Sensex of Bombay and the S P      for example use a selection committee and more subjective decision  making  rules to determine constituent securities

3,94,    Index Weighting
4,94,The weighting decision determines how much of each security to include in the index  and has a substantial impact on an index  s value  Index providers use a number of  methods to weight the constituent securities in an index  Indexes can be price weighted  equal weighted market  capitalization weighted or fundamentally weighted  Each  weighting method has its advantages and disadvantages  
5,94,      Price Weighting
6,94,The simplest method to weight an index and the one used by Charles Dow to construct  the Dow Jones Industrial Average is price weighting  In price weighting  the weight  on each constituent security is determined by dividing its price by the sum of all the  prices of the constituent securities   The weight is calculated using the following formula

20,94,Exhibit    illustrates the values  weights  and single  period returns following  inception of a price  weighted equity index with five constituent securities   The value  of the price  weighted index is determined by dividing the sum of the security values           by the divisor which is typically set at inception to equal the initial number  of securities in the index   Thus  in our example the divisor is   and the initial value  of the index is calculated as                     As illustrated in this exhibit  Security A  which has the highest price also has the  highest weighting and thus will have the greatest impact on the return of the index    Note how both the price return and the total return of the index are calculated on  the basis of the corresponding returns on the constituent securities   A property unique to price  weighted indexes is that a stock split on one constit  uent security changes the weights on all the securities in the index    To prevent the  stock split and the resulting new weights from changing the value of the index  the  index provider must adjust the value of the divisor as illustrated in Exhibit    Given  a    for    split in Security A  the divisor is adjusted by dividing the sum of the con  stituent prices after the split         by the value of the index before the split           This adjustment results in changing the divisor from   to      so that the index value  is maintained at        The primary advantage of price weighting is its simplicity  The main disadvantage  of price weighting is that it results in arbitrary weights for each security  In particu  lar a stock split in any one security causes arbitrary changes in the weights of all the  constituents  securities

15,96,      Equal Weighting
16,96,Another simple index weighting method is equal weighting  This method assigns an  equal weight to each constituent security at inception  The weights are calculated as  
17,96,w E
18,96,i
19,96,    N
20,96,    
21,96,where  wi   fraction of the portfolio that is allocated to security i or weight of  security i N   number of securities in the index To construct an equal  weighted index from the five securities in Exhibit   the index  provider allocates one  fifth      percent  of the value of the index  at the beginning  of the period  to each security  Dividing the value allocated to each security by each  security  s individual share price determines the number of shares of each security to  include in the index   Unlike a price  weighted index  where the weights are arbitrarily  determined by the market prices  the weights in an equal  weighted index are arbitrarily  assigned by the index provider  Exhibit    illustrates the values  weights  and single  period returns following  inception of an equal  weighted index with the same constituent securities as those  in Exhibit    This example assumes a beginning index portfolio value of        i e   an investment of      in each security   To set the initial value of the index to       the divisor is set to                         Exhibits   and   demonstrate how different weighting methods result in different  returns   The      percent price return of the equal  weighted index shown in Exhibit    differs significantly from the       percent price return of the price  weighted index  in Exhibit    Like price weighting  the primary advantage of equal weighting is its simplicity   Equal weighting  however has a number of disadvantages   First  securities that con  stitute the largest fraction of the target market value are underrepresented and secu  rities that constitute a small fraction of the target market value are overrepresented   Second after the index is constructed and the prices of constituent securities change  the index is no longer equally weighted  Therefore maintaining equal weights requires  frequent adjustments  rebalancing  to the index  
22,96,      Market  Capitalization Weighting
23,96,In market  capitalization weighting or value weighting  the weight on each constit  uent security is determined by dividing its market capitalization by the total market  capitalization  the sum of the market capitalization  of all the securities in the index    Market capitalization or value is calculated by multiplying the number of shares out  standing by the market price per share

21,98,In float  adjusted market 
22,98,capitalization weighting the weight on each constituent security is determined by  adjusting its market capitalization for its market float  Typically market float is the  number of shares of the constituent security that are available to the investing public   For companies that are closely held only a portion of the shares outstanding are avail  able to the investing public  the rest are held by a small group of controlling investors    In addition to excluding shares held by controlling shareholders  most float  adjusted  market  capitalization  weighted indexes also exclude shares held by other corporations  and governments  Some providers of indexes that are designed to represent the invest  ment opportunities of global investors further reduce the number of shares included  in the index by excluding shares that are not available to foreigner investors   The index  providers may refer to these indexes as  free  float  adjusted market  capitalization   weighted indexes    Float  adjusted market  capitalization  weighted indexes reflect the shares available  for public trading by multiplying the market price per share by the number of shares  available to the investing public  i e  the float  adjusted market capitalization  rather  than the total number of shares outstanding  total market capitalization   Currently  most market  capitalization  weighted indexes are float adjusted  Therefore unless oth  erwise indicated for the remainder of this reading   market  capitalization  weighting  refers to float  adjusted market  capitalization weighting

22,100,      Fundamental Weighting
23,100,Fundamental weighting attempts to address the disadvantages of market  capitalization  weighting by using measures of a company  s size that are independent of its security  price to determine the weight on each constituent security  These measures include  book value cash flow revenues  earnings  dividends  and number of employees   Some fundamental indexes use a single measure such as total dividends  to weight  the constituent securities  whereas others combine the weights from several measures  to form a composite value that is used for weighting   Letting Fi denote a given fundamental size measure of company i the fundamental  weight on security i is

37,100,Relative to a market  capitalization  weighted index  a fundamental index with  weights based on such an item as earnings will result in greater weights on constituent  securities with earnings yields  earnings divided by price  that are higher than the  earnings yield of the overall market  weighted portfolio  Similarly stocks with earnings  yields less than the yield on the overall market  weighted portfolio will have lower  weights   For example suppose there are two stocks in an index   Stock A has a market  capitalization of      million Stock B has a market capitalization of      million and  their aggregate market capitalization is     billion        million   Both companies

3,102,have earnings of      million and aggregate earnings of      million  Thus  Stock A  has an earnings yield of     percent          and Stock B has an earnings yield of      percent           The earnings weight of Stock A is    percent         which is  higher than its market  capitalization weight of    percent             The earnings  weight of Stock B is     percent         which is less than its market  capitalization  weight of     percent             Relative to the market  cap  weighted index  the  earnings  weighted index over  weights the high  yield Stock A and under  weights the  low  yield Stock B  The most important property of fundamental weighting is that it leads to indexes  that have a  value  tilt   That is  a fundamentally weighted index has ratios of book  value earnings  dividends  etc  to market value that are higher than its market   capitalization  weighted counterpart   Also in contrast to the momentum  effect  of  market  capitalization  weighted indexes  fundamentally weighted indexes generally will  have a contrarian  effect  in that the portfolio weights will shift away from securities  that have increased in relative value and toward securities that have fallen in relative  value whenever the portfolio is rebalanced 
4,102,    Index Management  Rebalancing and Reconstitution
5,102,So far we have discussed index construction  Index management entails the two  remaining questions      When should the index be rebalanced     When should the security selection and weighting decisions be re  examined 
6,102,      Rebalancing
7,102,Rebalancing refers to adjusting the weights of the constituent securities in the index    To maintain the weight of each security consistent with the index  s weighting method  the index provider rebalances the index by adjusting the weights of the constituent  securities on a regularly scheduled basis  rebalancing dates  usually quarterly   Rebalancing is necessary because the weights of the constituent securities change  as their market prices change  Note for example that the weights of the securities  in the equal  weighted index  Exhibit    at the end of the period are no longer equal   i e     percent  
8,102,Security A Security B Security C Security D Security E
9,102,                              
10,102,In rebalancing the index  the weights of Securities D and E  which had the highest  returns  would be decreased and the weights of Securities A  B and C  which had the  lowest returns  would be increased  Thus  rebalancing creates turnover within an index  Price  weighted indexes are not rebalanced because the weight of each constitu  ent security is determined by its price  For market  capitalization  weighted indexes   rebalancing is less of a concern because the indexes largely rebalance themselves   In  our market  capitalization index  for example the weight of Security C automatically  declined from        percent to       percent  reflecting the     percent decline in its  market price  Market  capitalization weights are only adjusted to reflect mergers   acquisitions  liquidations  and other corporate actions between rebalancing dates  
1,103,  
2,103,Reading      Security Market Indexes
3,103,      Reconstitution
4,103,Reconstitution is the process of changing the constituent securities in an index   It is  similar to a portfolio manager deciding to change the securities in his or her port  folio  Reconstitution is part of the rebalancing cycle  The reconstitution date is the  date on which index providers review the constituent securities  re  apply the initial  criteria for inclusion in the index  and select which securities to retain remove or  add  Constituent securities that no longer meet the criteria are replaced with securities  that do meet the criteria   Once the revised list of constituent securities is determined  the weighting method is re  applied  Indexes are reconstituted to reflect changes in the  target market  bankruptcies  de  listings  mergers  acquisitions  etc   and or to reflect  the judgment of the selection committee  Reconstitution creates turnover in a number of different ways  particularly for  market  capitalization  weighted indexes   When one security is removed and another  is added the index provider has to change the weights of the other securities in order  to maintain the market  capitalization weighting of the index   The frequency of reconstitution is a major issue for widely used indexes and their  constituent securities   The Russell      Index  for example reconstitutes annually   It is used as a benchmark by numerous investment funds  and each year prior to  the index  s reconstitution the managers of these funds buy stocks they think will be  added to the index driving those stocks  prices up and sell stocks they think will  be deleted from the index driving those stocks  prices down  Exhibit   illustrates the  potential impact of these decisions   Beginning in late April      some managers began  acquiring and bidding up the price of Uranium Energy Corporation  UEC  because  they believed that it would be included in the reconstituted Russell      Index   On     June Russell listed UEC as a preliminary addition to the Russell      Index and  the Russell      Index    By that time the stock value had increased by more than      percent   Investors continued to bid up the stock price in the weeks following the  announcement and the stock closed on the reconstitution date of    June at USD      up nearly     percent for the quarter 
5,103,  According to the press release final membership in the index would be published after market close  on Friday    June

25,104,USES OF MARKET INDEXES
26,104,Indexes were initially created to give a sense of how a particular security market  performed on a given day  With the development of modern financial theory their  uses in investment management have expanded significantly  Some of the major uses  of indexes include     gauges of market sentiment      proxies for measuring and modeling returns  systematic risk  and risk  adjusted  performance     proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models      benchmarks for actively managed portfolios   and    model portfolios for such investment products as index funds and exchange   traded funds  ETFs   Investors using security market indexes must be familiar with how various indexes are  constructed in order to select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs  
27,104,    Gauges of Market Sentiment
28,104,The original purpose of stock market indexes was to provide a gauge of investor  confidence or market sentiment   As indicators of the collective opinion of market  participants  indexes reflect investor attitudes and behavior  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average has a long history is frequently quoted in the media  and remains a popular  gauge of market sentiment   It may not accurately reflect the overall attitude of inves  tors or the  market   however because the index consists of only    of the thousands  of US stocks traded each day

3,105,    Proxies for Measuring and Modeling Returns Systematic  Risk and Risk  Adjusted Performance
4,105,The capital asset pricing model  CAPM  defines beta as the systematic risk of a security  with respect to the entire market   The market portfolio in the CAPM consists of all  risky securities   To represent the performance of the market portfolio investors use  a broad index   For example the Tokyo Price Index  TOPIX  and the S P     often  serve as proxies for the market portfolio in Japan and the United States  respectively  and are used for measuring and modeling systematic risk and market returns   Security market indexes also serve as market proxies when measuring risk  adjusted  performance  The beta of an actively managed portfolio allows investors to form a  passive alternative with the same level of systematic risk   For example if the beta of  an actively managed portfolio of global stocks is      with respect to the MSCI World  Index investors can create a passive portfolio with the same systematic risk by investing     percent of their portfolio in a MSCI World Index fund and holding the remaining    percent in cash  Alpha  the difference between the return of the actively managed  portfolio and the return of the passive portfolio is a measure of risk  adjusted return  or investment performance  Alpha can be the result of manager skill  or lack thereof    transaction costs  and fees  
5,105,    Proxies for Asset Classes in Asset Allocation Models
6,105,Because indexes exhibit the risk and return profiles of select groups of securities  they  play a critical role as proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models   They provide  the historical data used to model the risks and returns of different asset classes  
7,105,    Benchmarks for Actively Managed Portfolios
8,105,Investors often use indiexs as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of active port  folio managers   The index selected as the benchmark should reflect the investment  strategy used by the manager  For example an active manager investing in global  small  capitalization stocks should be evaluated using a benchmark index  such as  the FTSE Global Small Cap Index  which includes      small  capitalization stocks  across    countries   The choice of an index to use as a benchmark is important because an inappropriate  index could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding an active manager  s investment  performance  Suppose that the small  cap manager underperformed the small  cap  index but outperformed a broad equity market index  If investors use the broad market  index as a benchmark  they might conclude that the small  cap manager is earning  his or her fees and should be retained or given additional assets to invest   Using the  small  cap index as a benchmark might lead to a very different conclusion 
9,105,    Model Portfolios for Investment Products
10,105,Indexes also serve as the basis for the development of new investment products    Using indexes as benchmarks for actively managed portfolios has led some investors  to conclude that they should invest in the benchmarks instead  Based on the CAPM s  conclusion that investors should hold the market portfolio broad market index funds  have been developed to function as proxies for the market portfolio

4,106,Investment management firms initially developed and managed index portfolios  for institutional investors   Eventually mutual fund companies introduced index funds  for individual investors   Subsequently investment management firms introduced  exchange  traded funds  which are managed the same way as index mutual funds but  trade like stocks   The first ETFs were based on existing indexes   As the popularity of ETFs increased  index providers created new indexes for the specific purpose of forming ETFs  leading  to the creation of numerous narrowly defined indexes with corresponding ETFs   The  Market Vectors Vietnam ETF for example allows investors to invest in the equity  market of Vietnam  The choice of indexes to meet the needs of investors is extensive  Index providers are  constantly looking for opportunities to develop indexes to meet the needs of investors  
5,106,EQUITY INDEXES
6,106,A wide variety of equity indexes exist  including broad market  multi  market  sector  and style indexes  
7,106,    Broad Market Indexes
8,106,A broad equity market index  as its name suggests  represents an entire given equity  market and typically includes securities representing more than     percent of the  selected market   For example the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index  SSE  is  a market  capitalization  weighted index of all shares that trade on the Shanghai Stock  Exchange  In the United States  the Wilshire      Total Market Index is a market   capitalization  weighted index that includes more than      equity securities and  is designed to represent the entire US equity market    The Russell      consisting  of the largest      stocks by market capitalization represents    percent of the US  equity market  
9,106,    Multi  Market Indexes
10,106,Multi  market indexes usually comprise indexes from different countries and regions  and are designed to represent multiple security markets   Multi  market indexes may  represent multiple national markets  geographic regions  economic development  groups  and in some cases  the entire world  World indexes are of importance to  investors who take a global approach to equity investing without any particular bias  toward a particular country or region  A number of index providers publish families  of multi  market equity indexes   MSCI Barra offers a number of multi  market indexes   As shown in Exhibit   MSCI  Barra classifies countries and regions along two dimensions   level of economic devel  opment and geographic region  Developmental groups  which MSCI Barra refers to  as market classifications  include developed markets  emerging markets  and frontier  markets   The geographic regions are largely divided by longitudinal lines of the globe   the Americas  Europe with Africa  and Asia with the Pacific  MSCI Barra provides  country  and region  specific indexes for each of the developed and emerging markets
11,106,  Despite its name the Wilshire      has no constraint on the number of securities that can be included   It included approximately      securities at inception

31,107,      Fundamental Weighting in Multi  Market Indexes

2,108,Equity Indexes
3,108,    Sector Indexes
4,108,Sector indexes represent and track different economic sectors such as consumer  goods  energy finance health care and technology on either a national regional  or global basis   Because different sectors of the economy behave differently over the  course of the business cycle some investors may seek to overweight or underweight  their exposure to particular sectors   Sector indexes are organized as families   each index within the family represents  an economic sector  Typically the aggregation of a sector index family is equivalent  to a broad market index   Economic sector classification can be applied on a global  regional or country  specific basis  but no universally agreed upon sector classification  method exists   Sector indexes play an important role in performance analysis because they provide  a means to determine whether a portfolio manager is more successful at stock selection  or sector allocation  Sector indexes also serve as model portfolios for sector  specific  ETFs and other investment products  
5,108,    Style Indexes
6,108,Style indexes represent groups of securities classified according to market capital  ization value growth or a combination of these characteristics   They are intended  to reflect the investing styles of certain investors  such as the growth investor value  investor and small  cap investor 
7,108,      Market Capitalization
8,108,Market  capitalization indexes represent securities categorized according to the major  capitalization categories  large cap midcap and small cap  With no universal definition  of these categories  the indexes differ on the distinctions between large cap and midcap  and between midcap and small cap as well as the minimum market  capitalization  size required to be included in a small  cap index   Classification into categories can be  based on absolute market capitalization  e g   below      million  or relative market  capitalization  e g   the smallest      stocks  
9,108,      Value Growth Classification
10,108,Some indexes represent categories of stocks based on their classifications as either  value or growth stocks   Different index providers use different factors and valuation  ratios  low price  to  book ratios  low price  to  earnings ratios  high dividend yields   etc   to distinguish between value and growth equities  
11,108,      Market Capitalization and Value Growth Classification
12,108,Combining the three market  capitalization groups with value and growth classifica  tions results in six basic style index categories  
13,108,   Large  Cap Value    Mid  Cap Value    Small  Cap Value
14,108,   Large  Cap Growth    Mid  Cap Growth    Small  Cap Growth
15,108,Because indexes use different size and valuation classifications  the constituents  of indexes designed to represent a given style such as small  cap value may differ  sometimes substantially  Because valuation ratios and market capitalizations change over time stocks  frequently migrate from one style index category to another on reconstitution dates    As a result  style indexes generally have much higher turnover than do broad market  indexes

4,109,FIXED  INCOME INDEXES
5,109,A wide variety of fixed  income indexes exists  but the nature of the fixed  income  markets and fixed  income securities leads to some very important challenges to  fixed  income index construction and replication  These challenges are the number  of securities in the fixed  income universe the availability of pricing data  and the  liquidity of the securities  
6,109,    Construction
7,109,The fixed  income universe includes securities issued by governments  government  agencies  and corporations   Each of these entities may issue a variety of fixed  income  securities with different characteristics   As a result  the number of fixed  income  securities is many times larger than the number of equity securities   To represent a  specific fixed  income market or segment  indexes may include thousands of different  securities   Over time these fixed  income securities mature and issuers offer new  securities to meet their financing needs  leading to turnover in fixed  income indexes   Another challenge in index construction is that fixed  income markets are pre  dominantly dealer markets   This means that firms  dealers  are assigned to specific  securities and are responsible for creating liquid markets for those securities by pur  chasing and selling them from their inventory  In addition many securities do not  trade frequently and as a result  are relatively illiquid  As a result  index providers  must contact dealers to obtain current prices on constituent securities to update the  index or they must estimate the prices of constituent securities using the prices of  traded fixed  income securities with similar characteristics   These challenges can result in indexes with dissimilar numbers of bonds rep  resenting the same markets   As seen in Exhibit    the differences can be large  The  large number of fixed  income securities combined with the lack of liquidity of some  securities has made it more costly and difficult  compared with equity indexes  for  investors to replicate fixed  income indexes and duplicate their performance

4,112,INDEXES FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
5,112,Many investors seek to lower the risk or enhance the performance of their portfolios  by investing in assets classes other than equities and fixed income  Interest in alter  native assets and investment strategies has led to the creation of indexes designed to  represent broad classes of alternative investments   Three of the most widely followed  alternative investment classes are commodities  real estate and hedge funds  
6,112,    Commodity Indexes
7,112,Commodity indexes consist of futures contracts on one or more commodities  such  as agricultural products  rice wheat  sugar  livestock  cattle hogs  precious and  common metals  gold silver copper  and energy commodities  crude oil natural gas   Although some commodity indexes may include the same commodities  the returns  of these indexes may differ because each index may use a different weighting method   Because commodity indexes do not have an obvious weighting mechanism such as  market capitalization commodity index providers create their own weighting methods    Some indexes  such as the Commodity Research Bureau  CRB  Index  contain a fixed  number of commodities that are weighted equally  The S P GSCI uses a combination  of liquidity measures and world production values in its weighting scheme and allo  cates more weight to commodities that have risen in price  Other indexes have fixed  weights that are determined by a committee  The different weighting methods can also lead to large differences in exposure  to specific commodities   The S P GSCI for example has approximately double the  energy  sector weighting and one  third the agriculture sector weighting of the CRB  Index   These differences result in indexes with very different risk and return profiles    Unlike commodity indexes  broad equity and fixed  income indexes that target the  same markets share similar risk and return profiles   The performance of commodity indexes can also be quite different from their under  lying commodities because the indexes consist of futures contracts on the commodities  rather than the actual commodities   Index returns are affected by factors other than  changes in the prices of the underlying commodities because futures contracts must  be continually  rolled over   i e  replacing a contract nearing expiration with a new  contract   Commodity index returns reflect the risk  free interest rate the changes in  future prices  and the roll yield  Therefore a commodity index return can be quite  different from the return based on changes in the prices of the underlying commodities  
8,112,    Real Estate Investment Trust Indexes
9,112,Real estate indexes represent not only the market for real estate securities but also the  market for real estate a highly illiquid market and asset class with infrequent trans  actions and pricing information  Real estate indexes can be categorized as appraisal  indexes  repeat sales indexes  and real estate investment trust  REIT  indexes   REIT indexes consist of shares of publicly traded REITs   REITS are public or private  corporations organized specifically to invest in real estate either through ownership  of properties or investment in mortgages   Shares of public REITs are traded on the  world s various stock exchanges and are a popular choice for investing in commercial  real estate properties   Because REIT indexes are based on publicly traded REITs with  continuous market pricing  the value of REIT indexes is calculated continuously  The FTSE EPRA NAREIT global family of REIT indexes shown in Exhibit    seeks  to represent trends in real estate stocks worldwide and includes representation from  the European Real Estate Association  EPRA  and the National Association of Real  Estate Investment Trusts  NAREIT

16,113,    Hedge Fund Indexes
17,113,Hedge fund indexes reflect the returns on hedge funds   Hedge funds are private  investment vehicles that typically use leverage and long and short investment strategies   A number of research organizations maintain databases of hedge fund returns  and summarize these returns into indexes   These database indexes are designed to  represent the performance of the hedge funds on a very broad global level  hedge  funds in general  or the strategy level  Most of these indexes are equal weighted and  represent the performance of the hedge funds within a particular database  Most research organizations rely on the voluntary cooperation of hedge funds  to compile performance data   As unregulated entities  however hedge funds are not  required to report their performance to any party other than their investors   Therefore  each hedge fund decides to which database s  it will report its performance  As a  result  rather than index providers determining the constituents  the constituents  determine the index   Frequently a hedge fund reports its performance to only one database  The result  is little overlap of funds covered by the different indexes   With little overlap between  their constituents  different global hedge fund indexes may reflect very different per  formance for the hedge fund industry over the same period of time  Another consequence of the voluntary performance reporting is the potential  for survivorship bias and therefore inaccurate performance representation  This  means that hedge funds with poor performance may be less likely to report their  performance to the database or may stop reporting to the database so their returns  may be excluded when measuring the return of the index   As a result  the index may  not accurately reflect actual hedge fund performance so much as the performance of  hedge funds that are performing well

19,115,SUMMARY
20,115,This reading explains and illustrates the construction management and uses of security  market indexes   It also discusses various types of indexes   Security market indexes  are invaluable tools for investors  who can select from among thousands of indexes  representing a variety of security markets  market segments  and asset classes   These  indexes range from those representing the global market for major asset classes to  those representing alternative investments in specific geographic markets   To benefit  from the use of security market indexes  investors must understand their construction  and determine whether the selected index is appropriate for their purposes   Frequently  an index that is well suited for one purpose may not be well suited for other purposes    Users of indexes must be familiar with how various indexes are constructed in order  to select the index or indexes most appropriate for their needs   Among the key points made in this reading are the following     Security market indexes are intended to measure the values of different target  markets  security markets  market segments  or asset classes      The constituent securities selected for inclusion in the security market index are  intended to represent the target market      A price return index reflects only the prices of the constituent securities      A total return index reflects not only the prices of the constituent securities but  also the reinvestment of all income received since the inception of the index      Methods used to weight the constituents of an index range from the very sim  ple such as price and equal weightings  to the more complex  such as market   capitalization and fundamental weightings  
1,116,Summary
2,116,   
3,116,   Choices in index construction in particular the choice of weighting method  affect index valuation and returns      Index management includes    periodic rebalancing to ensure that the index  maintains appropriate weightings and    reconstitution to ensure the index  represents the desired target market      Rebalancing and reconstitution create turnover in an index   Reconstitution can  dramatically affect prices of current and prospective constituents      Indexes serve a variety of purposes   They gauge market sentiment and serve as  benchmarks for actively managed portfolios   They act as proxies for measuring  systematic risk and risk  adjusted performance  They also serve as proxies for  asset classes in asset allocation models and as model portfolios for investment  products      Investors can choose from security market indexes representing various asset  classes  including equity fixed  income commodity real estate and hedge fund  indexes      Within most asset classes  index providers offer a wide variety of indexes   ranging from broad market indexes to highly specialized indexes based on the  issuer  s geographic region economic development group or economic sector or  other factors      Proper use of security market indexes depends on understanding their con  struction and management

10,126,Market efficiency concerns the extent to which market prices incorporate available  information  If market prices do not fully incorporate information then opportunities  may exist to make a profit from the gathering and processing of information  The  subject of market efficiency is  therefore of great interest to investment managers   as illustrated in Example

4,127,Market Efficiency and Active Manager Selection
5,127,The chief investment officer  CIO  of a major university endowment fund has  listed eight steps in the active manager selection process that can be applied both  to traditional investments  e g   common equity and fixed  income securities  and  to alternative investments  e g   private equity hedge funds  and real assets   The  first step specified is the evaluation of market opportunity   What is the opportunity and why is it there  To answer this ques  tion we start by studying capital markets and the types of managers  operating within those markets   We identify market inefficiencies  and try to understand their causes  such as regulatory structures or  behavioral biases   We can rule out many broad groups of managers  and strategies by simply determining that the degree of market inef  ficiency necessary to support a strategy is implausible  Importantly  we consider the past history of active returns meaningless unless we  understand why markets will allow those active returns to continue  into the future   The CIO s description underscores the importance of not assuming that past  active returns that might be found in a historical dataset will repeat themselves  in the future  Active returns refer to returns earned by strategies that do not  assume that all information is fully reflected in market prices  
6,127,Governments and market regulators also care about the extent to which market  prices incorporate information  Efficient markets imply informative prices prices that  accurately reflect available information about fundamental values   In market  based  economies  market prices help determine which companies  and which projects  obtain  capital  If these prices do not efficiently incorporate information about a company  s  prospects  then it is possible that funds will be misdirected  By contrast  prices that  are informative help direct scarce resources and funds available for investment to  their highest  valued uses    Informative prices thus promote economic growth  The  efficiency of a country  s capital markets  in which businesses raise financing  is an  important characteristic of a well  functioning financial system  The remainder of this reading is organized as follows   Section   provides specifics  on how the efficiency of an asset market is described and discusses the factors affecting   i e  contributing to and impeding  market efficiency  Section   presents an influential  three  way classification of the efficiency of security markets and discusses its implica  tions for fundamental analysis  technical analysis  and portfolio management   Section    presents several market anomalies  apparent market inefficiencies that have received  enough attention to be individually identified and named  and describes how these  anomalies relate to investment strategies   Section   introduces behavioral finance and  how that field of study relates to market efficiency  A summary concludes the reading

5,128,    The Description of Efficient Markets
6,128,An informationally efficient market  an efficient market  is a market in which asset
7,128,prices reflect new information quickly and rationally  An efficient market is thus a  market in which asset prices reflect all past and present information   In this section we expand on this definition by clarifying the time frame required  for an asset s price to incorporate information as well as describing the elements of  information releases assumed under market efficiency  We discuss the difference  between market value and intrinsic value and illustrate how inefficiencies or discrep  ancies between these values can provide profitable opportunities for active investment   As financial markets are generally not considered being either completely efficient or  inefficient  but rather falling within a range between the two extremes  we describe a  number of factors that contribute to and impede the degree of efficiency of a financial  market   Finally we conclude our overview of market efficiency by illustrating how the  costs incurred by traders in identifying and exploiting possible market inefficiencies  affect how we interpret market efficiency  Investment managers and analysts  as noted are interested in market efficiency  because the extent to which a market is efficient affects how many profitable trading  opportunities  market inefficiencies  exist   Consistent  superior risk  adjusted returns   net of all expenses  are not achievable in an efficient market   In a highly efficient mar  ket  a passive investment strategy  i e  buying and holding a broad market portfolio   that does not seek superior risk  adjusted returns is preferred to an active investment  strategy because of lower costs  for example transaction and information  seeking  costs   By contrast  in a very inefficient market  opportunities may exist for an active  investment strategy to achieve superior risk  adjusted returns  net of all expenses in  executing the strategy  as compared with a passive investment strategy  In inefficient  markets  an active investment strategy may outperform a passive investment strategy  on a risk  adjusted basis   Understanding the characteristics of an efficient market and  being able to evaluate the efficiency of a particular market are important topics for  investment analysts and portfolio managers   An efficient market is a market in which asset prices reflect information quickly  But  what is the time frame of  quickly    Trades are the mechanism by which information  can be incorporated into asset transaction prices   The time needed to execute trades  to exploit an inefficiency may provide a baseline for judging speed of adjustment     The time frame for an asset s price to incorporate information must be at least as long  as the shortest time a trader needs to execute a transaction in the asset   In certain  markets  such as foreign exchange and developed equity markets  market efficiency  relative to certain types of information has been studied using time frames as short as  one minute or less   If the time frame of price adjustment allows many traders to earn  profits with little risk  then the market is relatively inefficient   These considerations  lead to the observation that market efficiency can be viewed as falling on a continuum 
8,128,  This definition is convenient for making several instructional points   The definition that most simply  explains the sense of the word efficient in this context can be found in Fama          An efficient capital  market is a market that is efficient in processing information   p          The technical term for superior in this context is positive abnormal in the sense of higher than expected  given the asset s risk  as measured according to capital market theory by the asset s contribution to the  risk of a well  diversified portfolio     Although the original theory of market efficiency does not quantify this speed the basic idea is that  it is sufficiently swift to make it impossible to consistently earn abnormal profits   Chordia  Roll and  Subrahmanyam        suggest that the adjustment to information on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   is between   and    minutes  
1,129,   
2,129,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,129,Finally an important point is that in an efficient market prices should be expected  to react only to the elements of information releases that are not anticipated fully  by investors that is  to the  unexpected  or  surprise  element of such releases    Investors process the unexpected information and revise expectations  for example  about an asset s future cash flows  risk  or required rate of return  accordingly  The  revised expectations enter or get incorporated in the asset price through trades in  the asset   Market participants who process the news and believe that at the current  market price an asset does not offer sufficient compensation for its perceived risk will  tend to sell it or even sell it short   Market participants with opposite views should be  buyers   In this way the market establishes the price that balances the various opinions  after expectations are revised 
4,129,EXAMPLE  
5,129,Price Reaction to the Default on a Bond Issue
6,129,Suppose that a speculative  grade bond issuer announces  just before bond markets  open that it will default on an upcoming interest payment   In the announce  ment  the issuer confirms various reports made in the financial media in the  period leading up to the announcement   Prior to the issuer  s announcement   the financial news media reported the following     suppliers of the company  were making deliveries only for cash payment reducing the company  s liquidity       the issuer  s financial condition had probably deteriorated to the point that it  lacked the cash to meet an upcoming interest payment   and    although public  capital markets were closed to the company it was negotiating with a bank for  a private loan that would permit it to meet its interest payment and continue  operations for at least nine months   If the issuer defaults on the bond the con  sensus opinion of analysts is that bondholders will recover approximately        to       per dollar face value     If the market for the bond is highly efficient  the bond s market price is  most likely to fully reflect the bond s value after default   A  in the period leading up to the announcement   B  in the first trade prices after the market opens on the announcement  day  C when the issuer actually misses the payment on the interest payment  date  If the market for the bond is highly efficient  the piece of information that  bond investors most likely focused on in the issuer  s announcement was  that the issuer   A had failed in its negotiations for a bank loan  B  lacked the cash to meet the upcoming interest payment   C had been required to make cash payments for supplier deliveries  
7,129, 
8,129,Solution to   
9,129,B is correct   The announcement removed any uncertainty about default   In the  period leading up to the announcement  the bond s market price incorporated  a probability of default but the price would not have fully reflected the bond s  value after default   The possibility that a bank loan might permit the company  to avoid default was not eliminated until the announcement

2,130,The Concept of Market Efficiency
3,130,Solution to   
4,130,A is correct   The failure of the loan negotiations first becomes known in this  announcement   The failure implies default  
5,130,    Market Value versus Intrinsic Value
6,130,Market value is the price at which an asset can currently be bought or sold  Intrinsic  value  sometimes called fundamental value  is  broadly speaking  the value that  would be placed on it by investors if they had a complete understanding of the asset s  investment characteristics    For a bond for example such information would include  its interest  coupon  rate principal value the timing of its interest and principal pay  ments  the other terms of the bond contract  indenture  a precise understanding of  its default risk  the liquidity of its market  and other issue  specific items   In addition  market variables such as the term structure of interest rates and the size of various  market premiums applying to the issue  for default risk  etc   would enter into a dis  counted cash flow estimate of the bond s intrinsic value  discounted cash flow models  are often used for such estimates   The word estimate is used because in practice  intrinsic value can be estimated but is not known for certain  If investors believe a market is highly efficient they will usually accept market  prices as accurately reflecting intrinsic values   Discrepancies between market price  and intrinsic value are the basis for profitable active investment   Active investors seek  to own assets selling below perceived intrinsic value in the marketplace and to sell or  sell short assets selling above perceived intrinsic value  If investors believe an asset market is relatively inefficient they may try to develop  an independent estimate of intrinsic value  The challenge for investors and analysts  is estimating an asset s intrinsic value  Numerous theories and models  including  the dividend discount model can be used to estimate an asset s intrinsic value but  they all require some form of judgment regarding the size timing  and riskiness of  the future cash flows associated with the asset   The more complex an asset s future  cash flows  the more difficult it is to estimate its intrinsic value  These complexities  and the estimates of an asset s market value are reflected in the market through the  buying and selling of assets   The market value of an asset represents the intersection  of supply and demand the point that is low enough to induce at least one investor  to buy while being high enough to induce at least one investor to sell  Because infor  mation relevant to valuation flows continually to investors  estimates of intrinsic value  change and hence market values change 
7,130,EXAMPLE  
8,130,Intrinsic Value
9,130,  An analyst estimates that a security  s intrinsic value is lower than its mar  ket value  The security appears to be  A undervalued  B  fairly valued  C overvalued    A market in which assets  market values are on average equal to or nearly  equal to intrinsic values is best described as a market that is attractive for  
10,130,  Intrinsic value is often defined as the present value of all expected future cash flows of the asset

4,131,Solution to   
5,131,C is correct   The market is valuing the asset at more than its true worth 
6,131,Solution to   
7,131,B is correct because an active investment is not expected to earn superior risk   adjusted returns   The additional costs of active investment are not justified in  such a market  
8,131,Solution to   
9,131,B is correct   If risk is underestimated the discount rate being applied to find  the present value of the expected cash flows  estimated intrinsic value  will be  too low and the intrinsic value estimate will be too high 
10,131,    Factors Contributing to and Impeding a Market s Efficiency
11,131,For markets to be efficient  prices should adjust quickly and rationally to the release of  new information  In other words  prices of assets in an efficient market should  fully  reflect  all information  Financial markets  however are generally not classified at  the two extremes as either completely inefficient or completely efficient but  rather  as exhibiting various degrees of efficiency  In other words  market efficiency should  be viewed as falling on a continuum between extremes of completely efficient  at one  end and completely inefficient  at the other  Asset prices in a highly efficient market   by definition reflect information more quickly and more accurately than in a less   efficient market  These degrees of efficiency also vary through time across geographical  markets  and by type of market   A number of factors contribute to and impede the  degree of efficiency in a financial market  
12,131,      Market Participants
13,131,One of the most critical factors contributing to the degree of efficiency in a market  is the number of market participants   Consider the following example that illustrates  the relationship between the number of market participants and market efficiency 
1,132,The Concept of Market Efficiency
2,132,   
3,132,EXAMPLE  
4,132,Illustration of Market Efficiency
5,132,Assume that the shares of a small market capitalization  cap  company trade on  a public stock exchange  Because of its size it is not considered  blue  chip  and  not many professional investors follow the activities of the company   A small   cap fund analyst reports that the most recent annual operating performance  of the company has been surprisingly good considering the recent slump in  its industry  The company  s share price however has been slow to react to the  positive financial results because the company is not being recommended by the  majority of research analysts   This mispricing implies that the market for this  company  s shares is less than fully efficient  The small  cap fund analyst recognizes  the opportunity and immediately recommends the purchase of the company  s  shares   The share price gradually increases as more investors purchase the shares  once the news of the mispricing spreads through the market  As a result it takes  a few days for the share price to fully reflect the information  Six months later the company reports another solid set of interim financial  results   But because the previous mispricing and subsequent profit opportuni  ties have become known in the market  the number of analysts following the  company  s shares has increased substantially  As a result  as soon as unexpected  information about the positive interim results are released to the public a large  number of buy orders quickly drive up the stock price thereby making the market  for these shares more efficient than before 
6,132,A large number of investors  individual and institutional  follow the major financial  markets closely on a daily basis  and if mispricings exist in these markets  as illus  trated by the example investors will act so that these mispricings disappear quickly   Besides the number of investors  the number of financial analysts who follow or ana  lyze a security or asset should be positively related to market efficiency  The number  of market participants and resulting trading activity can vary significantly through  time  A lack of trading activity can cause or accentuate other market imperfections  that impede market efficiency  In fact  in many of these markets  trading in many of  the listed stocks is restricted for foreigners   By nature this limitation reduces the  number of market participants  restricts the potential for trading activity and hence  reduces market efficiency 
7,132,EXAMPLE  
8,132,Factors Affecting Market Efficiency
9,132,The expected effect on market efficiency of opening a securities market to trading  by foreigners would be to  A decrease market efficiency  B  leave market efficiency unchanged  C  increase market efficiency 
10,132,  A  blue  chip  share is one from a well  recognized company that is considered to be high quality but  low risk   This term generally refers to a company that has a long history of earnings and paying dividends

2,133,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,133,Solution 
4,133,C is correct   The opening of markets as described should increase market effi  ciency by increasing the number of market participants  
5,133,      Information Availability and Financial Disclosure
6,133,Information availability  e g   an active financial news media  and financial disclo  sure should promote market efficiency  Information regarding trading activity and  traded companies in such markets as the New York Stock Exchange the London  Stock Exchange and the Tokyo Stock Exchange is readily available  Many investors  and analysts participate in these markets  and analyst coverage of listed companies is  typically substantial  As a result  these markets are quite efficient   In contrast  trad  ing activity and material information availability may be lacking in smaller securities  markets  such as those operating in some emerging markets   Similarly significant differences may exist in the efficiency of different types of  markets   For example many securities trade primarily or exclusively in dealer or over   the  counter  OTC  markets  including bonds  money market instruments  currencies   mortgage  backed securities  swaps  and forward contracts   The information provided  by the dealers that serve as market makers for these markets can vary significantly in  quality and quantity both through time and across different product markets   Treating all market participants fairly is critical for the integrity of the market and  explains why regulators place such an emphasis on  fair orderly and efficient mar  kets     A key element of this fairness is that all investors have access to the informa  tion necessary to value securities that trade in the market   Rules and regulations that  promote fairness and efficiency in a market include those pertaining to the disclosure  of information and illegal insider trading   For example US Securities and Exchange Commission s  SEC  s  Regulation FD   Fair Disclosure  requires that if security issuers provide nonpublic information to  some market professionals or investors  they must also disclose this information to  the public   This requirement helps provide equal and fair opportunities  which is  important in encouraging participation in the market  A related issue deals with illegal  insider trading   The SEC  s rules  along with court cases  define illegal insider trading  as trading in securities by market participants who are considered insiders  while in  possession of material nonpublic information about the security     Although these  rules cannot guarantee that some participants will not have an advantage over others  and that insiders will not trade on the basis of inside information the civil and crim  inal penalties associated with breaking these rules are intended to discourage illegal  insider trading and promote fairness   In the European Union insider trading laws are  generally enshrined in legislation and enforced by regulatory and judicial authorities

3,134,      Limits to Trading
4,134,Arbitrage is a set of transactions that produces riskless profits   Arbitrageurs are trad  ers who engage in such trades to benefit from pricing discrepancies  inefficiencies   in markets   Such trading activity contributes to market efficiency  For example if an  asset is traded in two markets but at different prices  the actions of buying the asset  in the market in which it is underpriced and selling the asset in the market in which  it is overpriced will eventually bring these two prices together  The presence of these  arbitrageurs helps pricing discrepancies disappear quickly  Obviously market efficiency  is impeded by any limitation on arbitrage resulting from operating inefficiencies  such  as difficulties in executing trades in a timely manner prohibitively high trading costs   and a lack of transparency in market prices   Some market experts argue that restrictions on short selling limit arbitrage trading   which impedes market efficiency  Short selling is the transaction whereby an investor  sells shares that he or she does not own by borrowing them from a broker and agreeing  to replace them at a future date  Short selling allows investors to sell securities they  believe to be overvalued much in the same way they can buy those they believe to  be undervalued  In theory such activities promote more efficient pricing   Regulators  and others  however have argued that short selling may exaggerate downward market  movements  leading to crashes in affected securities   In contrast  some researchers  report evidence indicating that when investors are unable to borrow securities  that is to  short the security or when costs to borrow shares are high market prices may deviate  from intrinsic values     Furthermore research suggests that short selling is helpful  in price discovery  that is  it facilitates supply and demand in determining prices    
5,134,    Transaction Costs and Information  Acquisition Costs
6,134,The costs incurred by traders in identifying and exploiting possible market inefficien  cies affect the interpretation of market efficiency  The two types of costs to consider  are transaction costs and information  acquisition costs      Transaction costs  Practically transaction costs are incurred in trading to  exploit any perceived market inefficiency  Thus   efficient  should be viewed  as efficient within the bounds of transaction costs   For example consider a  violation of the principle that two identical assets should sell for the same price  in different markets   Such a violation can be considered to be a rather simple  possible exception to market efficiency because prices appear to be inconsis  tently processing information  To exploit the violation a trader could arbitrage  by simultaneously shorting the asset in the higher  price market and buying the  asset in the lower  price market   If the price discrepancy between the two mar  kets is smaller than the transaction costs involved in the arbitrage for the lowest  cost traders  the arbitrage will not occur and both prices are in effect efficient  within the bounds of arbitrage  These bounds of arbitrage are relatively narrow  in highly liquid markets  such as the market for US Treasury bills  but could be  wide in illiquid markets      Information  acquisition costs   Practically expenses are always associated with  gathering and analyzing information  New information is incorporated in trans  action prices by traders placing trades based on their analysis of information   Active investors who place trades based on information they have gathered and  analyzed play a key role in market prices adjusting to reflect new information   The classic view of market efficiency is that active investors incur information

2,135,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,135,acquisition costs but that money is wasted because prices already reflect all rel  evant information  This view of efficiency is very strict in the sense of viewing  a market as inefficient if active investing can recapture any part of the costs   such as research costs and active asset selection  Grossman and Stiglitz         argue that prices must offer a return to information acquisition  in equilib  rium if markets are efficient  returns net of such expenses are just fair returns  for the risk incurred  The modern perspective views a market as inefficient if  after deducting such costs  active investing can earn superior returns   Gross  of expenses  a return should accrue to information acquisition in an efficient  market   In summary a modern perspective calls for the investor to consider transaction  costs and information  acquisition costs when evaluating the efficiency of a market   A  price discrepancy must be sufficiently large to leave the investor with a profit  adjusted  for risk  after taking account of the transaction costs and information  acquisition costs  to reach the conclusion that the discrepancy may represent a market inefficiency   Prices may somewhat less than fully reflect available information without there being  a true market opportunity for active investors

5,135,FORMS OF MARKET EFFICIENCY
6,135,Eugene Fama developed a framework for describing the degree to which markets  are efficient     In his efficient market hypothesis  markets are efficient when prices  reflect all relevant information at any point in time  This means that the market prices  observed for securities  for example reflect the information available at the time  In his framework  Fama defines three forms of efficiency   weak  semi  strong  and  strong   Each form is defined with respect to the available information that is reflected  in prices

18,135,A finding that investors can consistently earn abnormal returns by trading on the  basis of information is evidence contrary to market efficiency  In general abnormal  returns are returns in excess of those expected given a security  s risk and the market s  return  In other words  abnormal return equals actual return less expected return 
19,135,   Fama        
1,136,   
2,136,Forms of Market Efficiency
3,136,    Weak Form
4,136,In the weak  form efficient market hypothesis security prices fully reflect all past  market data which refers to all historical price and trading volume information  If  markets are weak  form efficient  past trading data are already reflected in current  prices and investors cannot predict future price changes by extrapolating prices or  patterns of prices from the past     Tests of whether securities markets are weak  form efficient require looking at  patterns of prices   One approach is to see whether there is any serial correlation in  security returns  which would imply a predictable pattern    Although there is some  weak correlation in daily security returns  there is not enough correlation to make  this a profitable trading rule after considering transaction costs   An alternative approach to test weak  form efficiency is to examine specific trading  rules that attempt to exploit historical trading data   If any such trading rule consis  tently generates abnormal risk  adjusted returns after trading costs  this evidence will  contradict weak  form efficiency  This approach is commonly associated with technical  analysis which involves the analysis of historical trading information  primarily pric  ing and volume data  in an attempt to identify recurring patterns in the trading data  that can be used to guide investment decisions   Many technical analysts  also referred  to as  technicians   argue that many movements in stock prices are based in large  part  on psychology  Many technicians attempt to predict how market participants  will behave based on analyses of past behavior and then trade on those predictions    Technicians often argue that simple statistical tests of trading rules are not conclusive  because they are not applied to the more sophisticated trading strategies that can be  used and that the research excludes the technician s subjective judgment   Thus  it is  difficult to definitively refute this assertion because there are an unlimited number  of possible technical trading rules   Can technical analysts profit from trading on past trends  Overall the evidence  indicates that investors cannot consistently earn abnormal profits using past prices or  other technical analysis strategies in developed markets     Some evidence suggests   however that there are opportunities to profit on technical analysis in countries with  developing markets  including Hungary Bangladesh and Turkey among others    
5,136,    Semi  Strong Form
6,136,In a semi  strong  form efficient market prices reflect all publicly known and available  information  Publicly available information includes financial statement data  such as  earnings  dividends  corporate investments  changes in management etc   and financial  market data  such as closing prices  shares traded etc    Therefore the semi  strong  form of market efficiency encompasses the weak form  In other words  if a market is  semi  strong efficient  then it must also be weak  form efficient   A market that quickly  incorporates all publicly available information into its prices is semi  strong efficient   In a semi  strong market efforts to analyze publicly available information are futile   That is  analyzing earnings announcements of companies to identify underpriced or  overpriced securities is pointless because the prices of these securities already reflect  all publicly available information  If markets are semi  strong efficient no single investor  has access to information that is not already available to other market participants 
7,136,   Market efficiency should not be confused with the random walk hypothesis  in which price changes  over time are independent of one another  A random walk model is one of many alternative expected return  generating models   Market efficiency does not require that returns follow a random walk      Serial correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which the returns in one period are related  to the returns in another period     Bessembinder and Chan        and Fifield Power and Sinclair            Fifield Power and Sinclair        Chen and Li        and Mobarek  Mollah and Bhuyan

3,137,and as a consequence no single investor can gain an advantage in predicting future  security prices   In a semi  strong efficient market  prices adjust quickly and accurately  to new information  Suppose a company announces earnings that are higher than  expected  In a semi  strong efficient market  investors would not be able to act on this  announcement and earn abnormal returns   A common empirical test of investors  reaction to information releases is the event  study  Suppose a researcher wants to test whether investors react to the announce  ment that the company is paying a special dividend  The researcher identifies a sample  period and then those companies that paid a special dividend in the period and the  date of the announcement   Then for each company  s stock  the researcher calculates  the expected return on the share for the event date  This expected return may be based  on many different models  including the capital asset pricing model a simple market  model or a market index return  The researcher calculates the excess return as the  difference between the actual return and the expected return  Once the researcher  has calculated the event s excess return for each share statistical tests are conducted  to see whether the abnormal returns are statistically different from zero  The process  of an event study is outlined in Exhibit

10,137,Perform statistical analyses on the excess returns in the sample to see whether these returns are different from zero
11,137,How do event studies relate to efficient markets  In a semi  strong efficient mar  ket  share prices react quickly and accurately to public information  Therefore if the  information is good news  such as better  than  expected earnings  one would expect  the company  s shares to increase immediately at the time of the announcement   if it  is bad news  one would expect a swift  negative reaction  If actual returns exceed what  is expected in absence of the announcement and these returns are confined to the  announcement period then they are consistent with the idea that market prices react  quickly to new information  In other words  the finding of excess returns at the time  of the announcement does not necessarily indicate market inefficiency  In contrast   the finding of consistent excess returns following the announcement would suggest  a trading opportunity  Trading on the basis of the announcement that is  once the  announcement is made would not  on average yield abnormal returns

4,139,    Strong Form
5,139,In a strong  form efficient market security prices fully reflect both public and  private information  A market that is strong  form efficient is  by definition also  semi  strong   and weak  form efficient   In the case of a strong  form efficient market   insiders would not be able to earn abnormal returns from trading on the basis of  private information  A strong  form efficient market also means that prices reflect all  private information which means that prices reflect everything that the management  of a company knows about the financial condition of the company that has not been  publicly released  However this is not likely because of the strong prohibitions against  insider trading that are found in most countries   If a market is strong  form efficient   those with insider information cannot earn abnormal returns   Researchers test whether a market is strong  form efficient by testing whether  investors can earn abnormal profits by trading on nonpublic information  The results  of these tests are consistent with the view that securities markets are not strong  form  efficient   many studies have found that abnormal profits can be earned when nonpublic  information is used   
6,139,    Implications of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
7,139,The implications of efficient markets to investment managers and analysts are import  ant because they affect the value of securities and how these securities are managed   Several implications can be drawn from the evidence on efficient markets for devel  oped markets      Securities markets are weak  form efficient  and therefore investors cannot earn  abnormal returns by trading on the basis of past trends in price     Securities markets are semi  strong efficient  and therefore analysts who collect  and analyze information must consider whether that information is already  reflected in security prices and how any new information affects a security  s  value       Securities markets are not strong  form efficient because securities laws are  intended to prevent exploitation of private information 
8,139,      Fundamental Analysis
9,139,Fundamental analysis is the examination of publicly available information and the  formulation of forecasts to estimate the intrinsic value of assets   Fundamental analysis  involves the estimation of an asset s value using company data  such as earnings and  sales forecasts  and risk estimates as well as industry and economic data  such as eco  nomic growth inflation and interest rates   Buy and sell decisions depend on whether  the current market price is less than or greater than the estimated intrinsic value 
10,139,   See Gan Lee Hwa  and Zhang        and Raja  Sudhahar and Selvam            Evidence that finds that markets are not strong  form efficient include Jaffe        and Rozeff and  Zaman            In the case of the Intel example this implication would mean estimating how the actual filing of the  lawsuit and the company  s reaction to the lawsuit affect the value of Intel while keeping in mind that the  expectation of a lawsuit was already impounded in Intel s stock price 
1,140,Market Pricing Anomalies
2,140,   
3,140,The semi  strong form of market efficiency says that all available public information  is reflected in current prices   So what good is fundamental analysis  Fundamental  analysis is necessary in a well  functioning market because this analysis helps the  market participants understand the value implications of information  In other words   fundamental analysis facilitates a semi  strong efficient market by disseminating value   relevant information  And although fundamental analysis requires costly information  this analysis can be profitable in terms of generating abnormal returns if the analyst  creates a comparative advantage with respect to this information   
4,140,      Technical Analysis
5,140,Investors using technical analysis attempt to profit by looking at patterns of prices  and trading volume  Although some price patterns persist  exploiting these patterns  may be too costly and hence would not produce abnormal returns   Consider a situation in which a pattern of prices exists   With so many investors  examining prices  this pattern will be detected  If profitable exploiting this pattern  will eventually affect prices such that this pattern will no longer exist   it will be arbi  traged away  In other words  by detecting and exploiting patterns in prices  technical  analysts assist markets in maintaining weak  form efficiency  Does this mean that  technical analysts cannot earn abnormal profits  Not necessarily because there may  be a possibility of earning abnormal profits from a pricing inefficiency  But would it  be possible to earn abnormal returns on a consistent basis from exploiting such a  pattern  No because the actions of market participants will arbitrage this opportunity  quickly and the inefficiency will no longer exist  
6,140,      Portfolio Management
7,140,If securities markets are weak  form and semi  strong  form efficient  the implication is  that active trading  whether attempting to exploit price patterns or public information  is not likely to generate abnormal returns   In other words  portfolio managers cannot  beat the market on a consistent basis  so therefore passive portfolio management  should outperform active portfolio management   Researchers have observed that  mutual funds do not  on average outperform the market on a risk  adjusted basis      Mutual funds perform on average similar to the market before considering fees and  expenses and perform worse than the market  on average once fees and expenses are  considered  Even if a mutual fund is not actively managed there are costs to managing  these funds  which reduces net returns   So what good are portfolio managers  The role of a portfolio manager is not nec  essarily to beat the market but  rather to establish and manage a portfolio consistent  with the portfolio s objectives  with appropriate diversification and asset allocation  while taking into consideration the risk preferences and tax situation of the investor 
8,140,MARKET PRICING ANOMALIES

3,141,conclude that a market anomaly may be present if a change in the price of an asset  or security cannot directly be linked to current relevant information known in the  market or to the release of new information into the market    The validity of any evidence supporting the potential existence of a market inef  ficiency or anomaly must be consistent over reasonably long periods   Otherwise a  detected market anomaly may largely be an artifact of the sample period chosen  In the  widespread search for discovering profitable anomalies  many findings could simply  be the product of a process called data mining also known as data snooping  In  generally accepted research practice an initial hypothesis is developed which is based  on economic rationale  Tests are then conducted on objectively selected data to either  confirm or reject the original hypothesis   However with data mining the process is  typically reversed  data are examined with the intent to develop a hypothesis  instead  of developing a hypothesis first   This is done by analyzing data in various manners   and even utilizing different empirical approaches until you find support for a desired  result  in this case a profitable anomaly   Can researchers look back on data and find a trading strategy that would have  yielded abnormal returns  Absolutely  Enough data snooping often can detect a trading  strategy that would have worked in the past by chance alone  But in an efficient mar  ket  such a strategy is unlikely to generate abnormal returns on a consistent basis in  the future  Also although identified anomalies may appear to produce excess returns   it is generally difficult to profitably exploit the anomalies after accounting for risk   trading costs  and so on  Several well  known anomalies are listed in Exhibit     This list is by no means  exhaustive but it provides information on the breadth of the anomalies   A few of  these anomalies are discussed in more detail in the following sections   The anomalies  are placed into categories based on the research method that identified the anom  aly  Time  series anomalies were identified using time series of data   Cross  sectional  anomalies were identified based on analyzing a cross section of companies that differ  on some key characteristics   Other anomalies were identified by a variety of means   including event studies

12,141,    Time  Series Anomalies
13,141,Two of the major categories of time  series anomalies that have been documented are     calendar anomalies and    momentum and overreaction anomalies  
1,142,   
2,142,Market Pricing Anomalies
3,142,      Calendar Anomalies
4,142,In the     s  a number of researchers reported that stock market returns in January  were significantly higher compared to the rest of the months of the year with most  of the abnormal returns reported during the first five trading days in January  Since  its first documentation in the     s  this pattern known as the January effect has  been observed in most equity markets around the world  This anomaly is also known  as the turn  of  the   year effect or even often referred to as the  small firm in January  effect  because it is most frequently observed for the returns of small market capi  talization stocks      The January effect contradicts the efficient market hypothesis because excess  returns in January are not attributed to any new and relevant information or news   A  number of reasons have been suggested for this anomaly including tax  loss selling    Researchers have speculated that  in order to reduce their tax liabilities  investors sell  their  loser  securities in December for the purpose of creating capital losses  which  can then be used to offset any capital gains   A related explanation is that these losers  tend to be small  cap stocks with high volatility    This increased supply of equities in  December depresses their prices  and then these shares are bought in early January at  relatively attractive prices   This demand then drives their prices up again  Overall the  evidence indicates that tax  loss selling may account for a portion of January abnormal  returns  but it does not explain all of it   Another possible explanation for the anomaly is so  called  window dressing  a  practice in which portfolio managers sell their riskier securities prior to    December   The explanation is as follows   many portfolio managers prepare the annual reports  of their portfolio holdings as of    December  Selling riskier securities is an attempt  to make their portfolios appear less risky  After    December a portfolio manager  would then simply purchase riskier securities in an attempt to earn higher returns    However similar to the tax  loss selling hypothesis  the research evidence in support  of the window dressing hypothesis explains some but not all of the anomaly  Recent evidence for both stock and bond returns suggests that the January effect is  not persistent and therefore is not a pricing anomaly  Once an appropriate adjustment  for risk is made the January  effect  does not produce abnormal returns     Several other calendar effects  including the day  of  the  week and the weekend  effects    have been found  These anomalies are summarized in Exhibit      But like the  size effect which will be described later most of these anomalies have been eliminated  over time  One view is that the anomalies have been exploited such that the effect  has been arbitraged away  Another view however is that increasingly sophisticated  statistical methodologies fail to detect pricing inefficiencies  
5,142,   There is also evidence of a January effect in bond returns that is more prevalent in high  yield corporate  bonds  similar to the small  company effect for stocks      See Roll            See for example Kim            For a discussion of several of these anomalous patterns  see Jacobs and Levy            The weekend effect consists of a pattern of returns around the weekend  abnormal positive returns  on Fridays followed by abnormally negative returns on Mondays   This is a day  of  the  week effect that  specifically links Friday and Monday returns   It is interesting to note that in      the weekend effect in  the United States was inverted with     percent of the gains from March       onward coming from the  first trading day of the week

12,143,      Momentum and Overreaction Anomalies
13,143,Momentum anomalies relate to short  term share price patterns   One of the earliest  studies to identify this type of anomaly was conducted by Werner DeBondt and  Richard Thaler who argued that investors overreact to the release of unexpected  public information    Therefore stock prices will be inflated  depressed  for those  companies releasing good  bad  information  This anomaly has become known as  the overreaction effect   Using the overreaction effect  they proposed a strategy that  involved buying  loser  portfolios and selling  winner  portfolios   They defined stocks  as winners or losers based on their total returns over the previous three  to five  year  period  They found that in a subsequent period the loser portfolios outperformed  the market  while the winner portfolios underperformed the market   Similar patterns  have been documented in many but not all global stock markets as well as in bond  markets   One criticism is that the observed anomaly may be the result of statistical  problems in the analysis   A contradiction to weak  form efficiency occurs when securities that have expe  rienced high returns in the short term tend to continue to generate higher returns  in subsequent periods     Empirical support for the existence of momentum in stock  returns in most stock markets around the world is well documented  If investors  can trade on the basis of momentum and earn abnormal profits  then this anomaly  contradicts the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis because it represents a  pattern in prices that can be exploited by simply using historical price information    Researchers have argued that the existence of momentum is rational and not  contrary to market efficiency because it is plausible that there are shocks to the  expected growth rates of cash flows to shareholders and that these shocks induce a  serial correlation that is rational and short lived    In other words  having stocks with  some degree of momentum in their security returns may not imply irrationality but   rather may reflect prices adjusting to a shock in growth rates  
14,143,   DeBondt and Thaler            Notice that this pattern lies in sharp contrast to DeBondt and Thaler  s reversal pattern that is displayed  over longer periods of time  In theory the two patterns could be related  In other words  it is feasible that  prices are bid up extremely high perhaps too high in the short term for companies that are doing well   In the longer term  three  to  five years  the prices of these short  term winners correct themselves and  they do poorly     Jegadeesh and Titman            Johnson        
1,144,Market Pricing Anomalies
2,144,   
3,144,    Cross  Sectional Anomalies
4,144,Two of the most researched cross  sectional anomalies in financial markets are the  size effect and the value effect  
5,144,      Size Effect
6,144,The size effect results from the observation that equities of small  cap companies  tend to outperform equities of large  cap companies on a risk  adjusted basis   Many  researchers documented a small  company effect soon after the initial research was  published in       This effect  however was not apparent in subsequent studies      Part of the reason that the size effect was not confirmed by subsequent studies may  be because of the fact that if it were truly an anomaly investors acting on this effect  would reduce any potential returns   But some of the explanation may simply be that  the effect as originally observed was a chance outcome and therefore not actually  an inefficiency 
7,144,      Value Effect
8,144,A number of global empirical studies have shown that value stocks  which are gen  erally referred to as stocks that have below  average price  to  earnings  P E  and  market  to  book  M B  ratios  and above  average dividend yields  have consistently  outperformed growth stocks over long periods of time    If the effect persists  the value  stock anomaly contradicts semi  strong market efficiency because all the information  used to categorize stocks in this manner is publicly available  Fama and French developed a three  factor model to predict stock returns     In  addition to the use of market returns as specified by the capital asset pricing model   CAPM  the Fama and French model also includes the size of the company as mea  sured by the market value of its equity and the company  s book value of equity divided  by its market value of equity which is a value measure  The Fama and French model  captures risk dimensions related to stock returns that the CAPM model does not  consider  Fama and French find that when they apply the three  factor model instead  of the CAPM the value stock anomaly disappears  
9,144,    Other Anomalies
10,144,A number of additional anomalies has been documented in the financial markets   including the existence of closed  end investment fund discounts  price reactions to  the release of earnings information returns of initial public offerings  and the pre  dictability of returns based on prior information 
11,144,      Closed  End Investment Fund Discounts
12,144,A closed  end investment fund issues a fixed number of shares at inception and does  not sell any additional shares after the initial offering   Therefore the fund capitalization  is fixed unless a secondary public offering is made  The shares of closed  end funds  trade on stock markets like any other shares in the equity market  i e  their prices are  determined by supply and demand  
13,144,   Although a large number of studies documents a small  company effect  these studies are concentrated  in a period similar to that of the original research and therefore use a similar data set   The key to whether  something is a true anomaly is persistence in out  of  sample tests   Fama and French        document that  the size effect is apparent only in microcap stocks but not in small  and large  cap stocks and these microcap  stocks may have a significant influence in studies that document a size effect      For example see Capaul Rowley and Sharpe        and Fama and French            Fama and French        
1,145,   
2,145,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,145,Theoretically these shares should trade at a price approximately equal to their  net asset value  NAV   per share which is simply the total market value of the fund s  security holdings less any liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding   An  abundance of research however has documented that  on average closed  end funds  trade at a discount from NAV  Most studies have documented average discounts in  the      percent range although individual funds have traded at discounts exceeding     percent and others have traded at large premiums     The closed  end fund discount presents a puzzle because conceptually an investor  could purchase all the shares in the fund liquidate the fund and end up making a  profit   Some researchers have suggested that these discounts are attributed to man  agement fees or expectations of the managers  performance but these explanations  are not supported by the evidence    An alternative explanation for the discount is  that tax liabilities are associated with unrealized capital gains and losses that exist  prior to when the investor bought the shares  and hence the investor does not have  complete control over the timing of the realization of gains and losses     Although the  evidence supports this hypothesis to a certain extent the tax effect is not large enough  to explain the entire discount  Finally it has often been argued that the discounts exist  because of liquidity problems and errors in calculating NAV  The illiquidity explanation  is plausible if shares are recorded at the same price as more liquid publicly traded  stocks   some evidence supports this assertion  But as with tax reasons  liquidity issues  explain only a portion of the discount effect   Can these discounts be exploited to earn abnormal returns if transaction costs  are taken into account  No  First  the transaction costs involved in exploiting the dis  count buying all the shares and liquidating the fund would eliminate any profit      Second these discounts tend to revert to zero over time  Hence a strategy to trade  on the basis of these discounts would not likely be profitable   
4,145,      Earnings Surprise
5,145,Although most event studies have supported semi  strong market efficiency some  researchers have provided evidence that questions semi  strong market efficiency   One of these studies relates to the extensively examined adjustment of stock prices  to earnings announcements     The unexpected part of the earnings announcement   or earnings surprise is the portion of earnings that is unanticipated by investors  and according to the efficient market hypothesis  merits a price adjustment   Positive   negative  surprises should cause appropriate and rapid price increases  decreases    Several studies have been conducted using data from numerous markets around the  world  Most of the results indicate that earnings surprises are reflected quickly in stock  prices  but the adjustment process is not always efficient   In particular although a  substantial adjustment occurs prior to and at the announcement date an adjustment  also occurs after the announcement     As a result of these slow price adjustments  companies that display the largest  positive earnings surprises subsequently display superior stock return performance  whereas poor subsequent performance is displayed by companies with low or negative
6,145,   See Dimson and Minio  Kozerski        for a review of this literature     See Lee Sheifer and Thaler            The return to owners of closed  end fund shares has three parts     the price appreciation or depreciation  of the shares themselves     the dividends earned and distributed to owners by the fund and    the capital  gains and losses earned by the fund that are distributed by the fund  The explanation of the anomalous  pricing has to do with the timing of the distribution of capital gains      See for example the study by Pontiff        which shows how the cost of arbitraging these discounts  eliminates the profit      See Pontiff            See Jones  Rendleman and Latan             Not surprisingly it is often argued that this slow reaction contributes to a momentum pattern

3,146,earnings surprises     This finding implies that investors could earn abnormal returns  using publicly available information by buying stocks of companies that had positive  earnings surprises and selling those with negative surprises   Although there is support for abnormal returns associated with earnings surprises   and some support for such returns beyond the announcement period there is also  evidence indicating that these observed abnormal returns are an artifact of studies  that do not sufficiently control for transaction costs and risk    
4,146,      Initial Public Offerings  IPOs 
5,146,When a company offers shares of its stock to the public for the first time it does so  through an initial public offering  or IPO   This offering involves working with an  investment bank that helps price and market the newly issued shares   After the offering  is complete the new shares trade on a stock market for the first time  Given the risk  that investment bankers face in trying to sell a new issue for which the true price is  unknown it is perhaps not surprising to find that  on average the initial selling price  is set too low and that the price increases dramatically on the first trading day  The  percentage difference between the issue price and the closing price at the end of the  first day of trading is often referred to as the degree of underpricing   The evidence suggests that  on average investors who are able to buy the shares  of an IPO at their offering price may be able to earn abnormal profits   For example  during the internet bubble of           many IPOs ended their first day of trading  up by more than      percent   Such performance however is not always the case   Sometimes the issues are priced too high which means that share prices drop on  their first day of trading   In addition the evidence also suggests that investors buying  after the initial offering are not able to earn abnormal profits because prices adjust  quickly to the  true  values  which supports semi  strong market efficiency  In fact  the  subsequent long  term performance of IPOs is generally found to be below average   Taken together the IPO underpricing and the subsequent poor performance suggests  that the markets are overly optimistic initially  i e  investors overreact   Some researchers have examined closely why IPOs may appear to have anomalous  returns   Because of the small size of the IPO companies and the method of equally  weighting the samples  what appears to be an anomaly may simply be an artifact of  the methodology   
6,146,      Predictability of Returns Based on Prior Information
7,146,A number of researchers have documented that equity returns are related to prior  information on such factors as interest rates  inflation rates  stock volatility and div  idend yields     But finding that equity returns are affected by changes in economic  fundamentals is not evidence of market inefficiency and would not result in abnormal  trading returns    
8,146,   A similar pattern has been documented in the corporate bond market  where bond prices react too  slowly to new company earnings announcements as well as to changes in company debt ratings      See Brown        for a summary of evidence supporting the existence of this anomaly  See Zarowin         for evidence regarding the role of size in explaining abnormal returns to surprises   Alexander Goff  and Peterson        for evidence regarding transaction costs and unexpected earnings strategies   and  Kim and Kim        for evidence indicating that the anomalous returns can be explained by risk factors      See Brav Geczy and Gompers            See for example Fama and Schwert        and Fama and French            See Fama and French        
1,147,   
2,147,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,147,Furthermore the relationship between stock returns and the prior information is  not consistent over time  For example in one study the relationship between stock  prices and dividend yields changed from positive to negative in different periods      Hence a trading strategy based on dividend yields would not yield consistent abnor  mal returns  
4,147,    Implications for Investment Strategies
5,147,Although it is interesting to consider the anomalies just described attempting to benefit  from them in practice is not easy  In fact  most researchers conclude that observed  anomalies are not violations of market efficiency but  rather are the result of statis  tical methodologies used to detect the anomalies   As a result  if the methodologies  are corrected most of these anomalies disappear    Another point to consider is that  in an efficient market  overreactions may occur but then so do under  reactions      Therefore on average the markets are efficient   In other words  investors face chal  lenges when they attempt to translate statistical anomalies into economic profits    Consider the following quote regarding anomalies from the Economist   Frontiers of  Finance Survey    October        Many can be explained away  When transactions costs are taken into  account  the fact that stock prices tend to over  react to news  falling back  the day after good news and bouncing up the day after bad news  proves  unexploitable  price reversals are always within the bid  ask spread  Others  such as the small  firm effect  work for a few years and then fail for a few  years   Others prove to be merely proxies for the reward for risk taking   Many  have disappeared since  and because  attention has been drawn to them  It is difficult to envision entrusting your retirement savings to a manager whose  strategy is based on buying securities on Mondays  which tends to have negative returns  on average and selling them on Fridays   For one thing  the negative Monday returns  are merely an average so on any given week  they could be positive  In addition such  a strategy would generate large trading costs   Even more importantly investors would  likely be uncomfortable investing their funds in a strategy that has no compelling  underlying economic rationale

7,147,BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
8,147,Behavioral finance examines investor behavior to understand how people make deci  sions  individually and collectively  Behavioral finance does not assume that people  consider all available information in decision  making and act rationally by maximizing  utility within budget constraints and updating expectations consistent with Bayes   formula   The resulting behaviors may affect what is observed in the financial markets    In a broader sense behavioral finance attempts to explain why individuals make  the decisions that they do whether these decisions are rational or irrational  The focus  of much of the work in this area is on the behavioral biases that affect investment  decisions   The behavior of individuals  in particular their behavioral biases  has been  offered as a possible explanation for a number of pricing anomalies  
9,147,   Schwert       Chapter         Fama            This point is made by Fama        
1,148,Behavioral Finance
2,148,   
3,148,Most asset  pricing models assume that markets are rational and that the intrinsic  value of a security reflects this rationality  But market efficiency and asset  pricing  models do not require that each individual is rational rather only that the market  is rational  If individuals deviate from rationality other individuals are assumed to  observe this deviation and respond accordingly  These responses move the market  toward efficiency  If this does not occur in practice it may be possible to explain some  market anomalies referencing observed behaviors and behavioral biases  
4,148,    Loss Aversion
5,148,In most financial models  the assumption is that investors are risk averse  Risk aver  sion refers to the tendency of people to dislike risk and to require higher expected  returns to compensate for exposure to additional risk   Behavioral finance allows for  the possibility that the dissatisfaction resulting from a loss exceeds the satisfaction  resulting from a gain of the same magnitude  Loss aversion refers to the tendency of  people to dislike losses more than they like comparable gains   This results in a strong  preference for avoiding losses as opposed to achieving gains     Some argue that  behavioral theories of loss aversion can explain observed overreaction in markets   If  loss aversion is more important than risk aversion researchers should observe that  investors overreact     Although loss aversion can explain the overreaction anomaly  evidence also suggests that under reaction is just as prevalent as overreaction which  counters these arguments  
6,148,    Herding
7,148,Herding behavior has been advanced as a possible explanation of under reaction and  overreaction in financial markets   Herding occurs when investors trade on the same  side of the market in the same securities  or when investors ignore their own private  information and or analysis and act as other investors do  Herding is clustered trad  ing that may or may not be based on information    Herding may result in under  or  over  reaction to information depending upon the direction of the herd 
8,148,    Overconfidence
9,148,A behavioral bias offered to explain pricing anomalies is overconfidence  If investors  are overconfident  they overestimate their ability to process and interpret information  about a security  Overconfident investors may not process information appropriately  and if there is a sufficient number of these investors  stocks will be mispriced    But  most researchers argue that this mispricing is temporary with prices correcting even  tually  If it takes a sufficiently long time for prices to become correctly priced and the  mispricing is predictable it may be possible for investors to earn abnormal profits   Evidence has suggested that overconfidence results in mispricing for US UK   German French and Japanese markets     This overconfidence however is predom  inantly in higher  growth companies  whose prices react slowly to new information   
10,148,   See DeBondt and Thaler        and Tversky and Kahneman            See Fama            The term used when there is herding without information is  spurious herding       Another aspect to overconfidence is that investors who are overconfident in their ability to select  investments and manage a portfolio tend to use less diversification investing in what is most familiar   Therefore investor behavior may affect investment results returns and risk without implications for  the efficiency of markets      Scott  Stumpp and Xu        and Boujelbene Abbes  Boujelbene and Bouri            Scott  Stumpp and Xu

2,149,Reading      Market Efficiency
3,149,    Information Cascades
4,149,An application of behavioral theories to markets and pricing focuses on the role of  personal learning in markets   Personal learning is what investors learn by observing  outcomes of trades and what they learn from  conversations  ideas shared among  investors about specific assets and the markets     Social interaction and the resultant  contagion is important in pricing and may explain such phenomena as price changes  without accompanying news and mistakes in valuation  Biases that investors possess can lead to herding behavior or information cas  cades   Herding and information cascades are related but not identical concepts   An  information cascade is the transmission of information from those participants who  act first and whose decisions influence the decisions of others   Those who are acting  on the choices of others may be ignoring their own preferences in favor of imitating  the choices of others   In particular information cascades may occur with respect to  the release of accounting information because accounting information may be diffi  cult to interpret and may be noisy  For example the release of earnings is difficult to  interpret because it is necessary to understand how the number was arrived at and  noisy because it is uncertain what the current earnings imply about future earnings   Information cascades may result in serial correlation of stock returns  which is  consistent with overreaction anomalies   Do information cascades result in correct  pricing  Some argue that if a cascade is leading toward an incorrect value this cascade  is  fragile  and will be corrected because investors will ultimately give more weight  to public information or the trading of a recognized informed trader    Information  cascades  although documented in markets  do not necessarily mean that investors  can exploit knowledge of them as profitable trading opportunities   Are information cascades rational  If the informed traders act first and uninformed  traders imitate the informed traders  this behavior is consistent with rationality  The  imitation trading by the uninformed traders may help the market incorporate relevant  information and improve market efficiency    However the imitation trading may lead  to an overreaction to information  The empirical evidence indicates that information  cascades are greater for a stock when the information quality regarding the company  is poor    Information cascades may enhance the information available to investors  
5,149,    Other Behavioral Biases
6,149,Other behavioral biases that have been put forth to explain observed investor behavior  include the following     representativeness investors assess new information and probabilities of out  comes based on similarity to the current state or to a familiar classification     mental accounting investors keep track of the gains and losses for different  investments in separate mental accounts and treat those accounts differently      conservatism investors tend to be slow to react to new information and con  tinue to maintain their prior views or forecasts   and    narrow framing investors focus on issues in isolation and respond to the  issues based on how the issues are posed   
7,149,   Hirshleifer and Teoh            Avery and Zemsky            Another alternative is that the uninformed traders are the majority of the market participants and the  imitators are imitating not because they agree with the actions of the majority but because they are looking  to act on the actions of the uninformed traders      Avery and Zemsky        and Bikhchandani Hirshleifer and Welch            For a review of these behavioral issues  see Hirshleifer        
1,150,Summary
2,150,   
3,150,The basic idea behind behavioral finance is that investors are humans and there  fore imperfect  These observed less than rational behaviors may help explain observed  pricing anomalies   The beliefs investors have about a given asset s value may not be  homogeneous   But an issue which is controversial is whether these insights can  help someone identify and exploit any mispricing   In other words  can investors use  knowledge of behavioral biases to predict how asset prices will be affected and act  based on the predictions to earn abnormal profits 
4,150,    Behavioral Finance and Investors
5,150,Behavior biases can affect all market participants  from the novice investor to the  most experienced investment manager  An understanding of behavioral finance can  help market participants recognize their own and others  behavioral biases   As a  result of this recognition they may be able to respond and make improved decisions   individually and collectively 
6,150,    Behavioral Finance and Efficient Markets
7,150,The use of behavioral finance to explain observed pricing is an important part of the  understanding of how markets function and how prices are determined  Whether there  is a behavioral explanation for market anomalies remains a debate  Pricing anomalies  are continually being uncovered and then statistical and behavioral explanations are  offered to explain these anomalies   On the one hand if investors must be rational for efficient markets to exist  then  all the imperfections of human investors suggest that markets cannot be efficient    On the other hand if all that is required for markets to be efficient is that investors  cannot consistently beat the market on a risk  adjusted basis  then the evidence does  support market efficiency 
8,150,SUMMARY
9,150,This reading has provided an overview of the theory and evidence regarding market  efficiency and has discussed the different forms of market efficiency as well as the  implications for fundamental analysis  technical analysis  and portfolio management    The general conclusion drawn from the efficient market hypothesis is that it is not  possible to beat the market on a consistent basis by generating returns in excess of  those expected for the level of risk of the investment   Additional key points include the following     The efficiency of a market is affected by the number of market participants and  depth of analyst coverage information availability and limits to trading      There are three forms of efficient markets  each based on what is considered  to be the information used in determining asset prices   In the weak form asset  prices fully reflect all market data  which refers to all past price and trading  volume information  In the semi  strong form asset prices reflect all publicly  known and available information  In the strong form asset prices fully reflect all  information which includes both public and private information     Intrinsic value refers to the true value of an asset  whereas market value refers  to the price at which an asset can be bought or sold  When markets are effi  cient  the two should be the same or very close  But when markets are not  efficient  the two can diverge significantly

3,151,   Most empirical evidence supports the idea that securities markets in developed  countries are semi  strong  form efficient   however empirical evidence does not  support the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis      A number of anomalies have been documented that contradict the notion of  market efficiency including the size anomaly the January anomaly and the  winners losers anomalies   In most cases  however contradictory evidence both  supports and refutes the anomaly     Behavioral finance uses human psychology such as behavioral biases  in an  attempt to explain investment decisions   Whereas behavioral finance is helpful  in understanding observed decisions  a market can still be considered efficient  even if market participants exhibit seemingly irrational behaviors  such as  herding

10,160,Equity securities represent ownership claims on a company  s net assets   As an asset  class  equity plays a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio manage  ment because it represents a significant portion of many individual and institutional  investment portfolios   The study of equity securities is important for many reasons   First  the decision  on how much of a client s portfolio to allocate to equities affects the risk and return  characteristics of the entire portfolio  Second different types of equity securities have  different ownership claims on a company  s net assets  which affect their risk and return

3,165,These observations and historical data are consistent with the concept that the  return on securities is directly related to risk level  That is  equity securities have higher  risk levels when compared with government bonds and bills  they earn higher rates  of return to compensate investors for these higher risk levels  and they also tend to  be more volatile over time

29,165,Given the high risk levels associated with equity securities  it is reasonable to  expect that investors  tolerance for risk will tend to differ across equity markets   This  is illustrated in Exhibit   which shows the results of a series of studies conducted by  the Australian Securities Exchange on international differences in equity ownership   During the           period equity ownership as a percentage of the population was  lowest in South Korea  averaging      percent  followed by Germany        percent   and Sweden      percent   In contrast  Australia  Canada  and the United States had  the highest equity ownership as a percentage of the population  averaging almost     percent   In addition there has been a relative decline in share ownership in several  countries over recent years  which is not surprising given the recent overall uncer  tainty in global economies and the volatility in equity markets that this uncertainty  has created

22,166,An important implication from the above discussion is that equity securities  represent a key asset class for global investors because of their unique return and  risk characteristics   We next examine the various types of equity securities traded on  global markets and their salient characteristics  
23,166,TYPES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF EQUITY  SECURITIES
24,166, 
25,166,Companies finance their operations by issuing either debt or equity securities   A key  difference between these securities is that debt is a liability of the issuing company  whereas equity is not   This means that when a company issues debt  it is contractually  obligated to repay the amount it borrows  i e  the principal or face value of the debt   at a specified future date  The cost of using these funds is called interest  which the  company is contractually obligated to pay until the debt matures or is retired  When the company issues equity securities  it is not contractually obligated to repay  the amount it receives from shareholders  nor is it contractually obligated to make  periodic payments to shareholders for the use of their funds   Instead shareholders  have a claim on the company  s assets after all liabilities have been paid  Because of  this residual claim equity shareholders are considered to be owners of the company   Investors who purchase equity securities are seeking total return  i e  capital or price  appreciation and dividend income  whereas investors who purchase debt securities   and hold until maturity  are seeking interest income  As a result  equity investors  expect the company  s management to act in their best interest by making operating  decisions that will maximize the market price of their shares  i e  shareholder wealth   In addition to common shares  also known as ordinary shares or common stock   companies may also issue preference shares  also known as preferred stock  the  other type of equity security  The following sections discuss the different types and  characteristics of common and preference securities  
1,167,   
2,167,Reading      Overview of Equity Securities
3,167,    Common Shares
4,167,Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and are the predomi  nant type of equity security  As a result  investors share in the operating performance  of the company participate in the governance process through voting rights  and have  a claim on the company  s net assets in the case of liquidation  Companies may choose  to pay out some or all of their net income in the form of cash dividends to common  shareholders  but they are not contractually obligated to do so   Voting rights provide shareholders with the opportunity to participate in major  corporate governance decisions  including the election of its board of directors  the  decision to merge with or take over another company and the selection of outside  auditors   Shareholder voting generally takes place during a company  s annual meet  ing   As a result of geographic limitations and the large number of shareholders  it is  often not feasible for shareholders to attend the annual meeting in person  For this  reason shareholders may vote by proxy which allows a designated party such as  another shareholder a shareholder representative or management to vote on the  shareholders  behalf  Regular shareholder voting  where each share represents one vote is referred to as  statutory voting  Although it is the common method of voting  it is not always the  most appropriate one to use to elect a board of directors   To better serve shareholders  who own a small number of shares  cumulative voting is often used  Cumulative  voting allows shareholders to direct their total voting rights to specific candidates  as  opposed to having to allocate their voting rights evenly among all candidates   Total  voting rights are based on the number of shares owned multiplied by the number of  board directors being elected  For example under cumulative voting  if four board  directors are to be elected a shareholder who owns     shares is entitled to     votes  and can either cast all     votes in favor of a single candidate or spread them across  the candidates in any proportion  In contrast  under statutory voting  a shareholder  would be able to cast only a maximum of     votes for each candidate  The key benefit to cumulative voting is that it allows shareholders with a small  number of shares to apply all of their votes to one candidate thus providing the  opportunity for a higher level of representation on the board than would be allowed  under statutory voting   Exhibit   describes the rights of Viacom Corporation s shareholders   In this case a  dual  share arrangement allows the founding chairman and his family to control more  than     percent of the voting rights through the ownership of Class A shares   This  arrangement gives them the ability to exert control over the board of director election  process  corporate decision making  and other important aspects of managing the  company  A cumulative voting arrangement for any minority shareholders of Class  A shares would improve their board representation 
5,167,  It is also possible for companies to pay more than the current period s net income as dividends   Such  payout policies are however generally not sustainable in the long run

5,168,Viacom has two classes of common stock   Class A  which is the voting stock   and Class B which is the non  voting stock   There is no difference between the  two classes except for voting rights   they generally trade within a close price  range of each other  There are however far more shares of Class B outstanding   so most of the trading occurs in that class      Voting Rights Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one  vote per share  Holders of Class B common stock do not have any voting  rights  except as required by Delaware law  Generally all matters to be  voted on by Viacom stockholders must be approved by a majority of the  aggregate voting power of the shares of Class A common stock present in  person or represented by proxy except as required by Delaware law     Dividends Stockholders of Class A common stock and Class B common  stock will share ratably in any cash dividend declared by the Board of  Directors  subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred  stock   Viacom does not currently pay a cash dividend and any decision to  pay a cash dividend in the future will be at the discretion of the Board of  Directors and will depend on many factors      Conversion So long as there are      shares of Class A common stock  outstanding  each share of Class A common stock will be convertible at  the option of the holder of such share into one share of Class B common  stock      Liquidation Rights In the event of liquidation dissolution or wind  ing  up of Viacom all stockholders of common stock  regardless of class   will be entitled to share ratably in any assets available for distributions to  stockholders of shares of Viacom common stock subject to the preferen  tial rights of any outstanding preferred stock      Split Subdivision or Combination In the event of a split  subdivision  or combination of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock or  Class B common stock  the outstanding shares of the other class of com  mon stock will be divided proportionally     Preemptive Rights Shares of Class A common stock and Class B com  mon stock do not entitle a stockholder to any preemptive rights enabling  a stockholder to subscribe for or receive shares of stock of any class or any  other securities convertible into shares of stock of any class of Viacom 
6,168,As seen in Exhibit   companies can issue different classes of common shares  Class  A and Class B shares  with each class offering different ownership rights    For exam  ple as shown in Exhibit   the Ford Motor Company has Class A shares   Common  Stock   which are owned by the investing public  It also has Class B shares  which  are owned only by the Ford family  The exhibit contains an excerpt from Ford s       Annual Report  p        Class A shareholders have    percent voting rights  whereas  Class B shareholders have     percent   In the case of liquidation however Class B  shareholders will not only receive the first US      per share that is available for

8,169,Common shares may also be callable or putable  Callable common shares  also  known as redeemable common shares  give the issuing company the option  or right   but not the obligation to buy back shares from investors at a call price that is spec  ified when the shares are originally issued  It is most common for companies to call   or redeem  their common shares when the market price is above the pre  specified  call price  The company benefits because it can buy back its shares below the current  market price and later resell them at a higher market price and it can also reduce div  idend payments to preserve capital if required  Investors benefit because they receive  a guaranteed return when their shares are called  Exhibit    provides an example of  callable common shares issued by Genomic Solutions in the US market   The exhibit  provides details on the creation of callable common shares used to consummate a  strategic alliance between PerkinElmer and Genomic Solutions   The arrangement  contains provisions more favorable to PerkinElmer because at the time it was a more  established and better capitalized company than Genomic Solutions

7,170,Putable common shares give investors the option or right to sell their shares  i e    put  them  back to the issuing company at a price that is specified when the shares are  originally issued  Investors will generally sell their shares back to the issuing company  when the market price is below the pre  specified put price  Thus  the put option feature  limits the potential loss for investors   From the issuing company  s perspective the put  option facilitates raising capital because the shares are more appealing to investors   Exhibit    provides an example of putable common shares issued by Dreyer  s  now  a subsidiary of Switzerland  based Nestl   In this case shareholders had the right to  sell their shares to Dreyer  s for US       the pre  specified put price

4,173,PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC EQUITY SECURITIES
5,173,Our discussion so far has focused on equity securities that are issued and traded in  public markets and on exchanges   Equity securities can also be issued and traded in  private equity markets   Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional  investors via non  public offerings  such as private placements   Because they are not  listed on public exchanges  there is no active secondary market for these securities    As a result  private equity securities do not have  market determined  quoted prices   are highly illiquid and require negotiations between investors in order to be traded   In addition financial statements and other important information needed to deter  mine the fair value of private equity securities may be difficult to obtain because the  issuing companies are typically not required by regulatory authorities to publish this  information  There are three primary types of private equity investments   venture capital lev  eraged buyouts  and private investment in public equity  Venture capital investments  provide  seed  or start  up capital early  stage financing  or mezzanine financing to  companies that are in the early stages of development and require additional capital  for expansion  These funds are then used to finance the company  s product devel  opment and growth  Venture capitalists range from family and friends to wealthy  individuals and private equity funds   Because the equity securities issued to venture  capitalists are not publicly traded they generally require a commitment of funds for  a relatively long period of time  the opportunity to  exit  the investment is typically  within   to    years from the initial start  up  The exit return earned by these private  equity investors is based on the price that the securities can be sold for if and when  the start  up company first goes public either via an initial public offering  IPO  on  the stock market or by being sold to other investors   A leveraged buyout  LBO  occurs when a group of investors  such as the com  pany  s management or a private equity partnership  uses a large amount of debt to  purchase all of the outstanding common shares of a publicly traded company  In  cases where the group of investors acquiring the company is primarily comprised of  the company  s existing management  the transaction is referred to as a management  buyout  MBO   After the shares are purchased they cease to trade on an exchange  and the investor group takes full control of the company  In other words  the company  is taken  private  or has been privatized  Companies that are candidates for these  types of transactions generally have large amounts of undervalued assets  which can  be sold to reduce debt  and generate high levels of cash flows  which are used to make  interest and principal payments on the debt   The ultimate objective of a buyout  LBO  or MBO  is to restructure the acquired company and later take it  public  again by  issuing new shares to the public in the primary market   The third type of private investment is a private investment in public equity  or PIPE     This type of investment is generally sought by a public company that is in  need of additional capital quickly and is willing to sell a sizeable ownership position  to a private investor or investor group  For example a company may require a large  investment of new equity funds in a short period of time because it has significant  expansion opportunities  is facing high levels of indebtedness  or is experiencing a  rapid deterioration in its operations   Depending on how urgent the need is and the  size of the capital requirement  the private investor may be able to purchase shares in  the company at a significant discount to the publicly  quoted market price  Exhibit     contains a recent PIPE transaction for the electronics retailer hhgregg  which also  included the issuance of additional common shares to the public

6,174,While the global private equity market is relatively small in comparison to the  global public equity market it has experienced considerable growth over the past three  decades   According to a study of the private equity market sponsored by the World  Economic Forum and spanning the period           approximately US     trillion  in debt and equity were acquired in leveraged buyouts   Of this amount approximately      percent or US      trillion worth of transactions occurred during               While the US and the UK markets were the focus of most private equity investments  during the     s and     s  private equity investments outside of these markets have  grown substantially in recent years   In addition the number of companies operating  under private equity ownership has also grown  For example during the mid      s   fewer than      companies were under LBO ownership compared to close to        companies that were under LBO ownership globally at the beginning of       The  holding period for private equity investments has also increased during this time  period from   to   years      s and     s  to approximately    years     The move to longer holding periods has given private equity investors the opportu  nity to more effectively and patiently address any underlying operational issues facing  the company and to better manage it for long  term value creation  Because of the  longer holding periods  more private equity firms are issuing convertible preference  shares because they provide investors with greater total return potential through  their dividend payments and the ability to convert their shares into common shares  during an IPO  In operating a publicly traded company management often feels pressured to  focus on short  term results    e g   meeting quarterly sales and earnings targets from  analysts biased toward near  term price performance  instead of operating the com  pany to obtain long  term sustainable revenue and earnings growth  By  going private   management can adopt a more long  term focus and can eliminate certain costs that  are necessary to operate a publicly traded company such as the cost of meeting  regulatory and stock exchange filing requirements  the cost of maintaining investor  relations departments to communicate with shareholders and the media  and the cost  of holding quarterly analyst conference calls   As described above public equity markets are much larger than private equity  networks and allow companies more opportunities to raise capital that is subsequently  actively traded in secondary markets   By operating under public scrutiny companies  are incentivized to be more open in terms of corporate governance and executive  compensation to ensure that they are acting for the benefit of shareholders   In fact   some studies have shown that private equity firms score lower in terms of corporate

5,175,INVESTING IN NON  DOMESTIC EQUITY SECURITIES
6,175,Technological innovations and the growth of electronic information exchanges   electronic trading networks  the internet  etc   have accelerated the integration and  growth of global financial markets   As detailed previously global capital markets have  expanded at a much more rapid rate than global GDP in recent years   both primary  and secondary international markets have benefited from the enhanced ability to  rapidly and openly exchange information  Increased integration of equity markets  has made it easier and less expensive for companies to raise capital and to expand  their shareholder base beyond their local market   Integration has also made it easier  for investors to invest in companies that are located outside of their domestic mar  kets   This has enabled investors to further diversify and improve the risk and return  characteristics of their portfolios by adding a class of assets with lower correlations  to local country assets   One barrier to investing globally is that many countries still impose  foreign  restrictions  on individuals and companies from other countries that want to invest  in their domestic companies   There are three primary reasons for these restrictions    The first is to limit the amount of control that foreign investors can exert on domestic  companies   For example some countries prevent foreign investors from acquiring a  majority interest in domestic companies   The second is to give domestic investors the  opportunity to own shares in the foreign companies that are conducting business in  their country  For example the Swedish home furnishings retailer IKEA abandoned  efforts to invest in parts of the Asia Pacific region because local governments did not  want IKEA to maintain complete ownership of its stores   The third reason is to reduce  the volatility of capital flows into and out of domestic equity markets   For example  one of the main consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis in         was the large  outflow of capital from such emerging market countries as Thailand Indonesia  and  South Korea   These outflows led to dramatic declines in the equity markets of these  countries and significant currency devaluations and resulted in many governments  placing restrictions on capital flows   Today many of these same markets have built  up currency reserves to better withstand capital outflows inherent in economic con  tractions and periods of financial market turmoil  Studies have shown that reducing restrictions on foreign ownership has led to  improved equity market performance over the long term    Although restrictions vary  widely more countries are allowing increasing levels of foreign ownership  For exam  ple Australia has sought tax reforms as a means to encourage international demand  for its managed funds in order to increase its role as an international financial center   Over the past two decades  three trends have emerged  a  an increasing number  of companies have issued shares in markets outside of their home country   b  the  number of companies whose shares are traded in markets outside of their home has  increased  and c  an increasing number of companies are dual listed which means that  their shares are simultaneously issued and traded in two or more markets   Companies  located in emerging markets have particularly benefited from these trends because  they no longer have to be concerned with capital constraints or lack of liquidity in  their domestic markets   These companies have found it easier to raise capital in the

34,176,Investors can use a variety of methods to invest in the equity of companies outside of  their local market   The most obvious is to buy and sell securities directly in foreign  markets   However this means that all transactions including the purchase and sale of  shares  dividend payments  and capital gains are in the company  s  not the investor  s   domestic currency  In addition investors must be familiar with the trading  clearing   and settlement regulations and procedures of that market   Investing directly often  results in less transparency and more volatility because audited financial information  may not be provided on a regular basis and the market may be less liquid  Alternatively  investors can use such securities as depository receipts and global registered shares   which represent the equity of international companies and are traded on local exchanges

4,177,    Depository Receipts
5,177,A depository receipt    DR  is a security that trades like an ordinary share on a  local exchange and represents an economic interest in a foreign company  It allows  the publicly listed shares of a foreign company to be traded on an exchange outside  its domestic market   A depository receipt is created when the equity shares of a for  eign company are deposited in a bank  i e  the depository  in the country on whose  exchange the shares will trade  The depository then issues receipts that represent the  shares that were deposited  The number of receipts issued and the price of each DR is  based on a ratio which specifies the number of depository receipts to the underlying  shares   Consequently a DR may represent one share of the underlying stock  many  shares of the underlying stock  or a fractional share of the underlying stock   The price  of each DR will be affected by factors that affect the price of the underlying shares   such as company fundamentals  market conditions  analysts  recommendations  and  exchange rate movements   In addition any short  term valuation discrepancies between  shares traded on multiple exchanges represent a quick arbitrage profit opportunity for  astute traders to exploit   The responsibilities of the depository bank that issues the  receipts include acting as custodian and as a registrar  This entails handling dividend  payments  other taxable events  stock splits  and serving as the transfer agent for the  foreign company whose securities the DR represents   The Bank of New York Mellon  is the largest depository bank   however Deutsche Bank  JPMorgan and Citibank also  offer depository services     A DR can be sponsored or unsponsored  A sponsored DR is when the foreign  company whose shares are held by the depository has a direct involvement in the  issuance of the receipts   Investors in sponsored DRs have the same rights as the  direct owners of the common shares  e g   the right to vote and the right to receive  dividends   In contrast with an unsponsored DR  the underlying foreign company has  no involvement with the issuance of the receipts   Instead the depository purchases the  foreign company  s shares in its domestic market and then issues the receipts through  brokerage firms in the depository  s local market  In this case the depository bank  not  the investors in the DR  retains the voting rights   Sponsored DRs are generally subject  to greater reporting requirements than unsponsored DRs   In the United States  for  example sponsored DRs must be registered  meet the reporting requirements  with  the US Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC   Exhibit    contains an example  of a sponsored DR issued by Japan Airlines

6,178,There are two types of depository receipts   Global depository receipts  GDRs  and  American depository receipts  ADRs  which are described below 
7,178,      Global Depository Receipts
8,178,A global depository receipt  GDR  is issued outside of the company  s home country  and outside of the United States   The depository bank that issues GDRs is generally  located  or has branches  in the countries on whose exchanges the shares are traded   A key advantage of GDRs is that they are not subject to the foreign ownership and  capital flow restrictions that may be imposed by the issuing company  s home country  because they are sold outside of that country  The issuing company selects the exchange  where the GDR is to be traded based on such factors as investors  familiarity with  the company or the existence of a large international investor base  The London and  Luxembourg exchanges were the first ones to trade GDRs   Some other stock exchanges  trading GDRs are the Dubai International Financial Exchange and the Singapore Stock  Exchange  Currently the London and Luxembourg exchanges are where most GDRs  are traded because they can be issued in a more timely manner and at a lower cost    Regardless of the exchange they are traded on the majority of GDRs are denominated  in US dollars  although the number of GDRs denominated in pound sterling and euros  is increasing   Note that although GDRs cannot be listed on US exchanges  they can  be privately placed with institutional investors based in the United States  
9,178,      American Depository Receipts
10,178,An American depository receipt  ADR  is a US dollar  denominated security that  trades like a common share on US exchanges   First created in      ADRs are the oldest  type of depository receipts and are currently the most commonly traded depository  receipts   They enable foreign companies to raise capital from US investors   Note that  an ADR is one form of a GDR  however not all GDRs are ADRs because GDRs cannot  be publicly traded in the United States   The term American depository share  ADS   is often used in tandem with the term ADR   A depository share is a security that is  actually traded in the issuing company  s domestic market   That is  while American  depository receipts are the certificates that are traded on US markets  American  depository shares are the underlying shares on which these receipts are based  There are four primary types of ADRs  with each type having different levels of  corporate governance and filing requirements   Level I Sponsored ADRs trade in the  over  the  counter  OTC  market and do not require full registration with the Securities  and Exchange Commission  SEC   Level II and Level III Sponsored ADRs can trade  on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  NASDAQ and American Stock Exchange   AMEX   Level II and III ADRs allow companies to raise capital and make acquisitions  using these securities   However the issuing companies must fulfill all SEC requirements

28,179,A global registered share  GRS  is a common share that is traded on different stock  exchanges around the world in different currencies   Currency conversions are not  needed to purchase or sell them because identical shares are quoted and traded in  different currencies   Thus  the same share purchased on the Swiss exchange in Swiss  francs can be sold on the Tokyo exchange for Japanese yen  As a result  GRSs offer  more flexibility than depository receipts because the shares represent an actual own  ership interest in the company that can be traded anywhere and currency conversions  are not needed to purchase or sell them  GRSs were created and issued by Daimler  Chrysler in

4,180,RISK AND RETURN CHARACTERISTICS OF EQUITY  SECURITIES
5,180, 
6,180,Different types of equity securities have different ownership claims on a company  s  net assets   The type of equity security and its features affect its risk and return char  acteristics   The following sections discuss the different return and risk characteristics  of equity securities  
7,180,    Return Characteristics of Equity Securities
8,180,   
9,180,There are two main sources of equity securities  total return  price change  or capital  gain  and dividend income  The price change represents the difference between the  purchase price  Pt    and the sale price  Pt  of a share at the end of time t     and t  respectively  Cash or stock dividends  Dt  represent distributions that the company  makes to its shareholders during period t  Therefore an equity security  s total return  is calculated as   Total return Rt    Pt   Pt     Dt  Pt     For non  dividend  paying stocks  the total return consists of price appreciation only   Companies that are in the early stages of their life cycle generally do not pay dividends  because earnings and cash flows are reinvested to finance the company  s growth  In  contrast  companies that are in the mature phase of their life cycle may not have as  many profitable growth opportunities   therefore excess cash flows are often returned  to investors via the payment of regular dividends or through share repurchases   For investors who purchase depository receipts or foreign shares directly there is  a third source of return  foreign exchange gains  or losses   Foreign exchange gains  arise because of the change in the exchange rate between the investor  s currency and  the currency that the foreign shares are denominated in  For example US investors  who purchase the ADRs of a Japanese company will earn an additional return if the  yen appreciates relative to the US dollar  Conversely these investors will earn a lower  total return if the yen depreciates relative to the US dollar  For example if the total  return for a Japanese company was     percent in Japan and the yen depreciated by     percent against the US dollar the total return of the ADR would be  approximately     percent   If the yen had instead appreciated by    percent against the US dollar the  total return of the ADR would be  approximately     percent   Investors that only consider price appreciation overlook an important source of  return  the compounding that results from reinvested dividends   Reinvested dividends  are cash dividends that the investor receives and uses to purchase additional shares    As Exhibit    shows  in the long run total returns on equity securities are dramatically  influenced by the compounding effect of reinvested dividends   Between      and       US   invested in US equities in      would have grown in real terms to US     with  dividends reinvested but to just US     when taking only the price appreciation or  capital gain into account  This corresponds to a real compounded return of     percent  per year with dividends reinvested versus only     percent per year without dividends

30,181,The risk of any security is based on the uncertainty of its future cash flows   The greater  the uncertainty of its future cash flows  the greater the risk and the more variable or  volatile the security  s price  As discussed above an equity security  s total return is  determined by its price change and dividends   Therefore the risk of an equity secu  rity can be defined as the uncertainty of its expected  or future  total return  Risk is  most often measured by calculating the standard deviation of the equity  s expected  total return  A variety of different methods can be used to estimate an equity  s expected total  return and risk   One method uses the equity  s average historical return and the standard  deviation of this return as proxies for its expected future return and risk   Another  method involves estimating a range of future returns over a specified period of time  assigning probabilities to those returns  and then calculating an expected return and  a standard deviation of return based on this information  The type of equity security as well as its characteristics  affects the uncertainty of  its future cash flows and therefore its risk   In general preference shares are less risky  than common shares for three main reasons     Dividends on preference shares are known and fixed and they account for  a large portion of the preference shares  total return  Therefore there is less  uncertainty about future cash flows

3,182,  Preference shareholders receive dividends and other distributions before com  mon shareholders     The amount preference shareholders will receive if the company is liquidated is  known and fixed as the par  or face  value of their shares   However there is no  guarantee that investors will receive that amount if the company experiences  financial difficulty  With common shares  however a larger portion of shareholders  total return  or  all of their total return for non  dividend shares  is based on future price appreciation  and future dividends are unknown  If the company is liquidated common shareholders  will receive whatever amount  if any  is remaining after the company  s creditors and  preference shareholders have been paid  In summary because the uncertainty sur  rounding the total return of preference shares is less than common shares  preference  shares have lower risk and lower expected return than common shares   It is important to note that some preference shares and common shares can be  riskier than others because of their associated characteristics   For example from an  investor  s point of view putable common or preference shares are less risky than  their callable or non  callable counterparts because they give the investor the option  to sell the shares to the issuer at a pre  determined price  This pre  determined price  establishes a minimum price that investors will receive and reduces the uncertainty  associated with the security  s future cash flow  As a result  putable shares generally  pay a lower dividend than non  putable shares   Because the major source of total return for preference shares is dividend income  the primary risk affecting all preference shares is the uncertainty of future dividend  payments   Regardless of the preference shares  features  callable putable cumulative  etc   the greater the uncertainty surrounding the issuer  s ability to pay dividends  the  greater risk   Because the ability of a company to pay dividends is based on its future  cash flows and net income investors try to estimate these amounts by examining past  trends or forecasting future amounts   The more earnings and the greater amount of  cash flow that the company has had or is expected to have the lower the uncertainty  and risk associated with its ability to pay future dividends   Callable common or preference shares are riskier than their non  callable coun  terparts because the issuer has the option to redeem the shares at a pre  determined  price  Because the call price limits investors  potential future total return callable  shares generally pay a higher dividend to compensate investors for the risk that the  shares could be called in the future  Similarly putable preference shares have lower  risk than non  putable preference shares   Cumulative preference shares have lower  risk than non  cumulative preference shares because the cumulative feature gives  investors the right to receive any unpaid dividends before any dividends can be paid  to common shareholders

5,182,Companies issue equity securities on primary markets to raise capital and increase  liquidity  This additional liquidity also provides the corporation an additional  cur  rency    its equity  which it can use to make acquisitions and provide stock option   based incentives to employees   The primary goal of raising capital is to finance the  company  s revenue  generating activities in order to increase its net income and  maximize the wealth of its shareholders   In most cases  the capital that is raised is  used to finance the purchase of long  lived assets  capital expansion projects  research  and development  the entry into new product or geographic regions  and the acqui  sition of other companies   Alternatively a company may be forced to raise capital to

4,183,    Accounting Return on Equity
5,183,Return on equity  ROE  is the primary measure that equity investors use to determine  whether the management of a company is effectively and efficiently using the capital  they have provided to generate profits   It measures the total amount of net income  available to common shareholders generated by the total equity capital invested in the  company  It is computed as net income available to ordinary shareholders  i e  after  preferred dividends have been deducted  divided by the average total book value of  equity  BVE   That is

6,187,We regularly report our per  share book value an easily calculable number though  one of limited use  Just as regularly we tell you that what counts is intrinsic value  a number that is impossible to pinpoint but essential to estimate  For example in      we could state with certitude that Berkshire s per   share book value was         However that figure considerably overstated the  stock s intrinsic value since all of the company  s resources were tied up in a  sub  profitable textile business   Our textile assets had neither going  concern nor  liquidation values equal to their carrying values   In      then anyone inquiring  into the soundness of Berkshire s balance sheet might well have deserved the  answer once offered up by a Hollywood mogul of dubious reputation   Don t  worry the liabilities are solid   Today Berkshire s situation has reversed  Many of the businesses we control  are worth far more than their carrying value   Those we don t control such as  Coca  Cola or Gillette are carried at current market values    We continue to give  you book value figures  however because they serve as a rough understated  tracking measure for Berkshire s intrinsic value  We define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash that can be  taken out of a business during its remaining life  Anyone calculating intrinsic  value necessarily comes up with a highly subjective figure that will change both  as estimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates move  Despite  its fuzziness  however intrinsic value is all  important and is the only logical way  to evaluate the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses   To see how historical input  book value  and future output  intrinsic value   can diverge let s look at another form of investment  a college education  Think  of the education s cost as its  book value   If it is to be accurate the cost should  include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he chose college  rather than a job  For this exercise we will ignore the important non  economic benefits of an  education and focus strictly on its economic value  First  we must estimate the  earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that  figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his education   That gives us an excess earnings figure which must then be discounted at an  appropriate interest rate back to graduation day  The dollar result equals the  intrinsic economic value of the education

3,188,    The Cost of Equity and Investors  Required Rates of Return
4,188,When companies issue debt  or borrow from a bank  or equity securities  there is a  cost associated with the capital that is raised  In order to maximize profitability and  shareholder wealth companies attempt to raise capital efficiently so as to minimize  these costs   When a company issues debt  the cost it incurs for the use of these funds is called  the cost of debt   The cost of debt is relatively easy to estimate because it reflects the  periodic interest  or coupon  rate that the company is contractually obligated to pay  to its bondholders  lenders   When a company raises capital by issuing equity the  cost it incurs is called the cost of equity  Unlike debt  however the company is not  contractually obligated to make any payments to its shareholders for the use of their  funds   As a result  the cost of equity is more difficult to estimate  Investors require a return on the funds they provide to the company  This return  is called the investor  s minimum required rate of return  When investors purchase  the company  s debt securities  their minimum required rate of return is the periodic  rate of interest they charge the company for the use of their funds   Because all of the  bondholders receive the same periodic rate of interest  their required rate of return is  the same  Therefore the company  s cost of debt and the investors  minimum required  rate of return on the debt are the same  When investors purchase the company  s equity securities  their minimum required  rate of return is based on the future cash flows they expect to receive  Because these  future cash flows are both uncertain and unknown the investors  minimum required  rate of return must be estimated  In addition the minimum required return may  differ across investors based on their expectations about the company  s future cash  flows   As a result  the company  s cost of equity may be different from the investors   minimum required rate of return on equity    Because companies try to raise capital  at the lowest possible cost  the company  s cost of equity is often used as a proxy for  the investors  minimum required rate of return  In other words  the cost of equity can be thought of as the minimum expected rate  of return that a company must offer its investors to purchase its shares in the primary  market and to maintain its share price in the secondary market   If this expected rate  of return is not maintained in the secondary market  then the share price will adjust  so that it meets the minimum required rate of return demanded by investors   For  example if investors require a higher rate of return on equity than the company  s cost  of equity they would sell their shares and invest their funds elsewhere resulting in a  decline in the company  s share price  As the share price declined the cost of equity  would increase to reach the higher rate of return that investors require  Two models commonly used to estimate a company  s cost of equity  or investors   minimum required rate of return  are the dividend discount model  DDM  and the  capital asset pricing model  CAPM   These models are discussed in detail in other  curriculum readings   The cost of debt  after tax  and the cost of equity  i e  the minimum required  rates of return on debt and equity  are integral components of the capital budgeting  process because they are used to estimate a company  s weighted average cost of cap  ital  WACC   Capital budgeting is the decision  making process that companies use  to evaluate potential long  term investments   The WACC represents the minimum  required rate of return that the company must earn on its long  term investments to  satisfy all providers of capital  The company then chooses among those long  term  investments with expected returns that are greater than its WACC  
5,188,   Another important factor that can cause a firm s cost of equity to differ from investors  required rate  of return on equity is the flotation cost associated with equity

3,189,SUMMARY
4,189,Equity securities play a fundamental role in investment analysis and portfolio manage  ment   The importance of this asset class continues to grow on a global scale because  of the need for equity capital in developed and emerging markets  technological  innovation and the growing sophistication of electronic information exchange  Given  their absolute return potential and ability to impact the risk and return characteristics  of portfolios  equity securities are of importance to both individual and institutional  investors   This reading introduces equity securities and provides an overview of global equity  markets   A detailed analysis of their historical performance shows that equity securities  have offered average real annual returns superior to government bills and bonds  which  have provided average real annual returns that have only kept pace with inflation  The  different types and characteristics of common and preference equity securities are  examined and the primary differences between public and private equity securities  are outlined  An overview of the various types of equity securities listed and traded  in global markets is provided including a discussion of their risk and return charac  teristics   Finally the role of equity securities in creating company value is examined  as well as the relationship between a company  s cost of equity its accounting return  on equity investors  required rate of return and the company  s intrinsic value  We conclude with a summary of the key components of this reading     Common shares represent an ownership interest in a company and give inves  tors a claim on its operating performance the opportunity to participate in the  corporate decision  making process  and a claim on the company  s net assets in  the case of liquidation     Callable common shares give the issuer the right to buy back the shares from  shareholders at a price determined when the shares are originally issued     Putable common shares give shareholders the right to sell the shares back to the  issuer at a price specified when the shares are originally issued     Preference shares are a form of equity in which payments made to prefer  ence shareholders take precedence over any payments made to common  stockholders      Cumulative preference shares are preference shares on which dividend pay  ments are accrued so that any payments omitted by the company must be paid  before another dividend can be paid to common shareholders   Non  cumulative  preference shares have no such provisions  implying that the dividend payments  are at the company  s discretion and are thus similar to payments made to com  mon shareholders      Participating preference shares allow investors to receive the standard preferred  dividend plus the opportunity to receive a share of corporate profits above a  pre  specified amount   Non  participating preference shares allow investors to  simply receive the initial investment plus any accrued dividends in the event of  liquidation     Callable and putable preference shares provide issuers and investors with the  same rights and obligations as their common share counterparts      Private equity securities are issued primarily to institutional investors in private  placements and do not trade in secondary equity markets   There are three types  of private equity investments   venture capital leveraged buyouts  and private  investments in public equity  PIPEs

5,199,INTRODUCTION
6,199,Industry analysis is the analysis of a specific branch of manufacturing  service or  trade  Understanding the industry in which a company operates provides an essential  framework for the analysis of the individual company that is  company analysis   Equity analysis and credit analysis are often conducted by analysts who concentrate  on one or several industries  which results in synergies and efficiencies in gathering  and interpreting information  Among the questions we address in this reading are the following     What are the similarities and differences among industry classification systems     How does an analyst go about choosing a peer group of companies     What are the key factors to consider when analyzing an industry     What advantages are enjoyed by companies in strategically well  positioned  industries  After discussing the uses of industry analysis in the next section Sections   and    discuss  respectively approaches to identifying similar companies and industry  classification systems   Section   covers the description and analysis of industries    Also Section   which includes an introduction to competitive analysis  provides a  background to Section   which introduces company analysis   The reading ends with  a summary and practice problems follow the text  
7,199,USES OF INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
8,199,Industry analysis is useful in a number of investment applications that make use of  fundamental analysis   Its uses include the following     Understanding a company s business and business environment  Industry  analysis is often a critical early step in stock selection and valuation because it  provides insights into the issuer  s growth opportunities  competitive dynamics   and business risks   For a credit analyst  industry analysis provides insights into  the appropriateness of a company  s use of debt financing and into its ability to  meet its promised payments during economic contractions      Identifying active equity investment opportunities  Investors taking a top  down  investing approach use industry analysis to identify industries with positive  neutral or negative outlooks for profitability and growth  Generally inves  tors will then overweight  market weight  or underweight those industries   as appropriate to their outlooks  relative to the investor  s benchmark if the  investor judges that the industry  s perceived prospects are not fully incorpo  rated in market prices   Apart from security selection some investors attempt  to outperform their benchmarks by industry or sector rotation that is  timing  investments in industries in relation to an analysis of industry fundamentals  and or business  cycle conditions  technical analysis may also play a role in such  strategies   Several studies have underscored the importance of industry analy  sis by suggesting that the industry factor in stock returns is at least as important  as the country factor  e g   Cavaglia  Diermeier Moroz  and De Zordo        In

3,200,addition industry membership has been found to account for about    percent  of the variability of a company  s profitability in the United States  McGahan and  Porter           Portfolio performance attribution  Performance attribution which addresses the  sources of a portfolio s returns  usually in relation to the portfolio s benchmark   includes industry or sector selection  Industry classification schemes play a role  in such performance attribution  Later in this reading we explore the considerations involved in understanding  a company  s business and business environment   The next section addresses how  companies may be grouped into industries  
4,200,APPROACHES TO IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES
5,200,Industry classification attempts to place companies into groups on the basis of  commonalities   In the following sections  we discuss the three major approaches to  industry classification     products and or services supplied     business  cycle sensitivities   and    statistical similarities  
6,200, 
7,200,    Products and or Services Supplied
8,200,Modern classification schemes are most commonly based on grouping companies by  similar products and or services   According to this perspective an industry is defined  as a group of companies offering similar products and or services   For example major  companies in the global heavy truck industry include Volvo Daimler AG Paccar  and Navistar all of which make large commercial vehicles for the on  highway truck  market   Similarly some of the large players in the global automobile industry are  Toyota  General Motors  Volkswagen Ford Honda  Nissan PSA Peugeot Citro n and  Hyundai all of which produce light vehicles that are close substitutes for one another  Industry classification schemes typically provide multiple levels of aggregation  The  term sector is often used to refer to a group of related industries   The health care sector  for example consists of a number of related industries  including the pharmaceutical  biotechnology medical device medical supply hospital and managed care industries   These classification schemes typically place a company in an industry on the basis  of a determination of its principal business activity  A company  s principal business  activity is the source from which the company derives a majority of its revenues and  or earnings   For example companies that derive a majority of their revenues from  the sale of pharmaceuticals include Novartis AG Pfizer Inc  Roche Holding AG  GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi  aventis S A   all of which could be grouped together as  part of the global pharmaceutical industry  Companies that engage in more than one  significant business activity usually report the revenues  and in many cases  operating  profits  of the different business segments in their financial statements    Examples of classification systems based on products and or services include  the commercial classification systems that will be discussed later namely the Global  Industry Classification Standard  GICS  Russell Global Sectors  RGS  and Industry
9,200,  For more information see International Financial Reporting Standard  IFRS     Operating Segments    In IFRS   business segments are called operating segments 
1,201,   
2,201,Reading      Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis
3,201,Classification Benchmark   In addition to grouping companies by product and or  service some of the major classification systems  including GICS and RGS group  consumer  related companies into cyclical and non  cyclical categories depending  on the company  s sensitivity to the business cycle  The next section addresses how  companies can be categorized on the basis of economic sensitivity 
4,201,    Business  Cycle Sensitivities
5,201,Companies are sometimes grouped on the basis of their relative sensitivity to the  business cycle  This method often results in two broad groupings of companies  cyclical and non  cyclical  A cyclical company is one whose profits are strongly correlated with the strength  of the overall economy  Such companies experience wider  than  average fluctuations  in demand high demand during periods of economic expansion and low demand  during periods of economic contraction and or are subject to greater  than  average  profit variability related to high operating leverage  i e  high fixed costs   Concerning  demand cyclical products and services are often relatively expensive and or repre  sent purchases that can be delayed if necessary  e g   because of declining disposable  income   Examples of cyclical industries are autos  housing  basic materials  industrials   and technology  A non  cyclical company is one whose performance is largely inde  pendent of the business cycle  Non  cyclical companies produce goods or services for  which demand remains relatively stable throughout the business cycle  Examples of  non  cyclical industries are food and beverage household and personal care products   health care and utilities   Although the classification systems we will discuss do not label their categories as  cyclical or non  cyclical certain sectors tend to experience greater economic sensitivity  than others   Sectors that tend to exhibit a relatively high degree of economic sensi  tivity include consumer discretionary energy financials  industrials  technology and  materials   In contrast  sectors that exhibit relatively less economic sensitivity include  consumer staples  health care telecommunications  and utilities  
6,201,EXAMPLE  
7,201,Descriptions Related to the Cyclical Noncyclical  Distinction
8,201,Analysts commonly encounter a number of labels related to the cyclical non   cyclical distinction  For example non  cyclical industries have sometimes been  sorted into defensive  or stable  versus growth  Defensive industries and com  panies are those whose revenues and profits are least affected by fluctuations  in overall economic activity  These industries companies tend to produce staple  consumer goods  e g   bread  to provide basic services  grocery stores  drug  stores  fast food outlets  or to have their rates and revenues determined by  contracts or government regulation  e g   cost  of  service rate  of  return regu  lated public utilities   Growth industries would include industries with specific  demand dynamics that are so strong that they override the significance of broad  economic or other external factors and generate growth regardless of overall  economic conditions  although their rates of growth may slow during an eco  nomic downturn  
9,201,  Sometimes the  growth  label is attached to countries or regions in which economic growth is so strong  that the fluctuations in local economic activity do not produce an actual decline in economic output merely  variation from high to low rates of real growth  e g   China  India  
1,202,Approaches to Identifying Similar Companies
2,202,   
3,202,The usefulness of industry and company labels such as cyclical growth and  defensive is limited  Cyclical industries as well as growth industries often have  growth companies within them  A cyclical industry itself although exposed to  the effects of fluctuations in overall economic activity may grow at an above   average rate for periods spanning multiple business cycles    Furthermore when  fluctuations in economic activity are large as in the deep recession of            few companies escape the effects of the cyclical weakness in overall economic  activity  The defensive label is also problematic  Industries may include both companies  that are growth and companies that are defensive in character making the choice  between a  growth  and a  defensive  label difficult  Moreover  defensive  cannot  be understood as necessarily being descriptive of investment characteristics    Food supermarkets  for example would typically be described as defensive but  can be subject to profit  damaging price wars   So  called defensive industries  companies may sometimes face industry dynamics that make them far from  defensive in the sense of preserving shareholders  capital 
4,202,One limitation of the cyclical non  cyclical classification is that business  cycle  sensitivity is a continuous spectrum rather than an  either or  issue so placement  of companies in one of the two major groups is somewhat arbitrary  The impact of  severe recessions usually reaches all parts of the economy so non  cyclical is better  understood as a relative term  Another limitation of a business  cycle classification for global investing is that  different countries and regions of the world frequently progress through the various  stages of the business cycle at different times   While one region of the world may be  experiencing economic expansion other regions or countries may be in recession  which complicates the application of a business  cycle approach to industry analysis    For example a jewelry retailer  i e  a cyclical company  that is selling domestically into  a weak economy will exhibit markedly different fundamental performance relative to  a jewelry company operating in an environment where demand is robust   Comparing  these two companies that is  similar companies that are currently exposed to dif  ferent demand environments could suggest investment opportunities   Combining  fundamental data from such companies  however to establish industry benchmark  values would be misleading  
5,202,    Statistical Similarities
6,202,Statistical approaches to grouping companies are typically based on the correlations  of past securities  returns   For example using the technique known as cluster analy  sis  companies are separated  on the basis of historical correlations of stock returns   into groups in which correlations are relatively high but between which correlations  are relatively low  This method of aggregation often results in non  intuitive groups of  companies  and the composition of the groups may vary significantly by time period  and region of the world  Moreover statistical approaches rely on historical data  but  analysts have no guarantee that past correlation values will continue in the future   In addition such approaches carry the inherent dangers of all statistical methods   namely    falsely indicating a relationship that arose because of chance or    falsely  excluding a relationship that actually is significant  
7,202,  The label growth cyclical is sometimes used to describe companies that are growing rapidly on a long   term basis but that still experience above  average fluctuation in their revenues and profits over the course  of a business cycle

4,203,INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
5,203,A well  designed classification system often serves as a useful starting point for industry  analysis   It allows analysts to compare industry trends and relative valuations among  companies in a group  Classification systems that take a global perspective enable  portfolio managers and research analysts to make global comparisons of companies in  the same industry  For example given the global nature of the automobile industry a  thorough analysis of the industry would include auto companies from many different  countries and regions of the world 
6,203,    Commercial Industry Classification Systems
7,203,Major index providers  including Standard   Poor  s  MSCI Barra  Russell Investments   Dow Jones  and FTSE  classify companies in their equity indexes into industry group  ings   Most classification schemes used by these index providers contain multiple levels  of classification that start at the broadest level with a general sector grouping  then  in several further steps  subdivide or disaggregate the sectors into more  granular    i e  more narrowly defined  sub  industry groups  
8,203,      Global Industry Classification Standard
9,203,GICS was jointly developed by Standard   Poor  s and MSCI Barra  two of the largest  providers of global equity indexes  in       As the name implies  GICS was designed  to facilitate global comparisons of industries  and it classifies companies in both  developed and developing economies   Each company is assigned to a sub  industry  according to its principal business activity  Each sub  industry belongs to a particular  industry   each industry belongs to an industry group  and each group belongs to a  sector  In June      the GICS classification structure comprised four levels of detail  consisting of     sub  industries     industries     industry groups  and    sectors    The composition of GICS has historically been adjusted over time to reflect changes  in the global equity markets  
10,203,      Russell Global Sectors
11,203,The RGS classification system uses a three  tier structure to classify companies globally  on the basis of the products or services a company produces   In June      the RGS  classification system consisted of   sectors     subsectors  and     industries   Besides  the number of tiers  another difference between the RGS and GICS classification sys  tems is that the RGS system contains nine sectors  whereas GICS consists of ten  For  example the RGS system does not provide a separate sector for telecommunication  service companies   Many companies that GICS classifies as  Telecommunication  Services   including China Mobile Ltd  AT T and Telefonica  are assigned by RGS  to its more broadly defined  Utilities  sector 
12,203,      Industry Classification Benchmark
13,203,The Industry Classification Benchmark  ICB  which was jointly developed by Dow  Jones and FTSE  uses a four  tier structure to categorize companies globally on the basis  of the source from which a company derives the majority of its revenue  In June       the ICB classification system consisted of    industries     supersectors     sectors   and     subsectors   Although the ICB is similar to GICS in the number of tiers and  the method by which companies are assigned to particular groups  the two systems  use significantly different nomenclature  For example whereas GICS uses the term   sector  to describe its broadest grouping of companies  ICB uses the term  indus  try   Another difference between the two systems is that ICB distinguishes between
1,204,Industry Classification Systems
2,204,   
3,204,consumer goods and consumer services companies  whereas both GICS and the RGS  systems group consumer products companies and consumer services companies  together into sectors on the basis of economic sensitivity  These stylistic distinctions  tend to be less obvious at the more granular levels of the different hierarchies   Despite these subtle differences  the three commercial classification systems use  common methodologies for assigning companies to groups   Also the broadest level  of grouping for all three systems is quite similar  Specifically GICS the RGS and the  ICB each identify   or    broad groupings below which all other categories reside   Next  we describe sectors that are fairly representative of how the broadest level of  industry classification is viewed by GICS RGS and ICB

4,207,B is correct   A producer of staple foods such as cereals is a classic example of  a non  cyclical company  Demand for automobiles is cyclical that is  relatively  high during economic expansions and relatively low during economic contrac  tions   Also demand for teenage fashions is likely to be more sensitive to the  business cycle than demand for standard food items such as breakfast cereals    When budgets have been reduced families may try to avoid expensive clothing  or extend the life of existing wardrobes  
5,207,Solution to   
6,207,A is correct  
7,207,    Governmental Industry Classification Systems
8,207,A number of classification systems in use by various governmental agencies today  organize statistical data according to type of industrial or economic activity  A com  mon goal of each government classification system is to facilitate the comparison of  data both over time and among countries that use the same system  Continuity of the  data is critical to the measurement and evaluation of economic performance over time 
9,207,      International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities
10,207,The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities  ISIC   was adopted by the United Nations in      to address the need for international com  parability of economic statistics   ISIC classifies entities into various categories on the  basis of the principal type of economic activity the entity performs   ISIC is organized  into    categories     sections     divisions      groups  and more than     classes    According to the United Nations  a majority of the countries around the world have  either used ISIC as their national activity classification system or have developed  national classifications derived from ISIC   Some of the organizations currently using  the ISIC are the UN and its specialized agencies  the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  and other international bodies  
11,207,      Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community
12,207,Often regarded as the European version of ISIC  Statistical Classification of Economic  Activities in the European Community  NACE  is the classification of economic  activities that correspond to ISIC at the European level  Similar to ISIC  NACE clas  sification is organized according to economic activity  NACE is composed of four  levels namely sections  identified by alphabetical letters A through U  divisions   identified by two  digit numerical codes    through     groups  identified by three   digit numerical codes      through       and classes  identified by four  digit numerical  codes       through        
13,207,      Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification
14,207,The Australian and New Zealand Standard  Industrial Classification  ANZSIC  was  jointly developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics New Zealand  in      to facilitate the comparison of industry statistics of the two countries and  comparisons with the rest of the world  International comparability was achieved  by aligning ANZSIC with the international standards used by ISIC   ANZSIC has a  structure comprising five levels namely divisions  the broadest level  subdivisions   groups  classes  and at the most granular level subclasses  New Zealand only

2,208,   
3,208,      North American Industry Classification System
4,208,Jointly developed by the United States  Canada  and Mexico the North American  Industry Classification System  NAICS  replaced the Standard Industrial Classification   SIC  system in       NAICS distinguishes between establishments and enterprises    NAICS classifies establishments into industries according to the primary business  activity of the establishment   In the NAICS system an establishment is defined as  a  single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial  operations are performed   e g   factory store hotel movie theater farm office   An  enterprise may consist of more than one location performing the same or different  types of economic activities   Each establishment of that enterprise is assigned a NAICS  code on the basis of its own primary business activity   NAICS uses a two  digit through six  digit code to structure its categories into five  levels of detail  The greater the number of digits in the code the more narrowly defined  the category  The five levels of categories  from broadest to narrowest  are sector  sig  nified by the first two digits of the code  subsector  third digit of the code  industry  group  fourth digit  NAICS industry  fifth digit  and national industry  sixth digit    The five  digit code is the level of greatest amount of comparability among countries    a six  digit code provides for more country  specific detail  Although differences exist  the structures of ISIC  NACE  ANZSIC  and NAICS  are similar enough that many of the categories from each of the different classification  systems are compatible with one another  The US Census Bureau has published tables  showing how the various categories of the classification systems relate to one another  
5,208,    Strengths and Weaknesses of Current Systems
6,208,Unlike commercial classification systems  most government systems do not disclose  information about a specific business or company so an analyst cannot know all of  the constituents of a particular category  For example in the United States  federal  law prohibits the Census Bureau from disclosing individual company activities  so  their NAICS and SIC codes are unknown  Most government and commercial classification systems are reviewed and if  necessary updated from time to time  Generally commercial classification systems  are adjusted more frequently than government classification systems  which may be  updated only every five years or so  NAICS for example is reviewed for potential  revisions every five years   Government classification systems generally do not distinguish between small  and large businesses  between for  profit and not  for  profit organizations  or between  public and private companies   Many commercial classification systems have the abil  ity to distinguish between large and small companies by virtue of association with a  particular equity index  and these systems include only for  profit and publicly traded  organizations   Another limitation of current systems is that the narrowest classification unit  assigned to a company generally cannot be assumed to be its peer group for the pur  poses of detailed fundamental comparisons or valuation  A peer group is a group  of companies engaged in similar business activities whose economics and valuation  are influenced by closely related factors   Comparisons of a company in relation to a  well  defined peer group can provide valuable insights into the company  s performance  and its relative valuation

3,209,    Constructing a Peer Group
4,209,The construction of a peer group is a subjective process   the result often differs sig  nificantly from even the most narrowly defined categories given by the commercial  classification systems   However commercial classification systems do provide a starting  point for the construction of a relevant peer group because by using such systems  an  analyst can quickly discover the public companies operating in the chosen industry  In fact  one approach to constructing a peer group is to start by identifying other  companies operating in the same industry  Analysts who subscribe to one or more of  the commercial classification systems that were discussed in Section     can quickly  generate a list of other companies in the industry in which the company operates  according to that particular service provider  s definition of the industry  An analyst  can then investigate the business activities of these companies and make adjustments  as necessary to ensure that the businesses truly are comparable  The following lists  of suggested steps and questions are given as practical aids to analysts in identifying  peer companies  
5,209,Steps in constructing a preliminary list of peer companies
6,209,   Examine commercial classification systems  if available to the analyst   These  systems often provide a useful starting point for identifying companies operat  ing in the same industry     Review the subject company  s annual report for a discussion of the competitive  environment   Companies frequently cite specific competitors      Review competitors  annual reports to identify other potential comparable  companies      Review industry trade publications to identify comparable companies      Confirm that each comparable company derives a significant portion of its reve  nue and operating profit from a business activity similar to the primary business  of the subject company 
7,209,Questions that may improve the list of peer companies
8,209,   What proportion of revenue and operating profit is derived from business activ  ities similar to those of the subject company  In general a higher percentage  results in a more meaningful comparison     Does a potential peer company face a demand environment similar to that of  the subject company  For example a comparison of growth rates  margins  and  valuations may be of limited value when comparing companies that are exposed  to different stages of the business cycle   As mentioned such differences may be  the result of conducting business in geographically different markets       Does a potential company have a finance subsidiary  Some companies operate  a finance division to facilitate the sale of their products  e g   Caterpillar Inc   and John Deere   To make a meaningful comparison of companies  the analyst  should make adjustments to the financial statements to lessen the impact that  the finance subsidiaries have on the various financial metrics being compared  Example    illustrates the process of identifying a peer group of companies and  shows some of the practical hurdles to determining a peer group 
1,210,Industry Classification Systems
2,210,   
3,210,EXAMPLE  
4,210,An Analyst Researches the Peer Group of Brink s Home  Security
5,210,Suppose that an analyst needs to identify the peer group of companies for Brink s  Home Security for use in the valuation section of a company report   Brink s  is a provider of electronic security and alarm monitoring services primarily  to residential customers in North America   The analyst starts by looking at  Brink s industry classification according to GICS  As previously discussed the  most narrowly defined category that GICS uses is the sub  industry level and in  June       Brink s was in the GICS sub  industry called Specialized Consumer  Services  together with the companies listed here 
6,210,GICS Sector   Consumer Discretionary  GICS Industry Group  Consumer Services  GICS Industry   Diversified Consumer Services   GICS Sub  Industry   Specialized Consumer Services   Brink s Home Security Holdings  Inc   Coinstar Inc   H R Block  Inc    Hillenbrand Inc   Mathews International Corporation  Pre  Paid Legal Services Inc   Regis Corporation   Service Corporation International   Sotheby  s
7,210,After looking over the list of companies  the analyst quickly realizes that some  adjustments need to be made to the list to end up with a peer group of companies  that are comparable to Brink s   For example Brink s has little in common with  the hair care salon services of Regis or for that matter with the funeral service  operations of Hillenbrand Mathews  or Service Corporation  In fact after careful  inspection the analyst concludes that none of the other companies included in  the GICS sub  industry are particularly good  comparables  for Brink s   Next  the analyst reviews the latest annual report for Brink s to find manage  ment statements concerning its competitors   On p    of Brink s          K  in the  section titled  Industry Trends and Competition  is a list of other companies  with comparable business activities    We believe our primary competitors with  national scope include  ADT Security Services  Inc   part of Tyco International  Ltd   Protection One Inc  Monitronics International Inc  and Stanley Security  Solutions   part of The Stanley Works    The analyst notes that Protection One  on this list is another publicly held security services company and a likely can  didate for inclusion in the peer group for Brink s   Monitronics International is  privately held so the analyst excludes it from the peer group  up  to  date detailed  fundamental data are not available for it   The analyst discovers that ADT represents a significant portion of Tyco  International s sales and profits  more than    percent of      sales and profits    therefore an argument could be made to include Tyco International in the peer  group  The analyst might also consider including Stanley Works in the peer group  because that company derived roughly a third of its revenue and close to half of  its operating profit from its security division in       Just as the analyst reviewed
1,211,   
2,211,Reading      Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis
3,211,the latest annual report for Brink s to identify additional potential comparables   the analyst should also scan the annual reports of the other companies listed  to see if other comparables exist   In checking these three companies  annual  reports  the analyst finds that Protection One is the only one that cites specific  competitors   Tyco and Stanley Works discuss competition only broadly  After scanning all of the annual reports  the analyst finds no additional  comparables   The analyst decides that Brink s peer group consists of ADT Security Services   Protection One and Stanley Security Solutions but also decides to give extra  weight to the comparison with Protection One in valuation because the com  parison with Protection One has the fewest complicating factors   In connection with this discussion note that International Financial Reporting  Standards and US GAAP require companies to disclose financial information  about their operating segments  subject to certain qualifications   Such disclo  sures provide analysts with operational and financial information that can be  helpful in peer  group determination 
4,211,Although companies with limited lines of business may neatly be categorized into  a single peer group companies with multiple divisions may be included in more than  one category  For example Belgium  based Anheuser  Busch InBev primarily makes  and sells various brands of beer  It can easily be grouped together with other beverage  companies  the theme park business constitutes a relatively immaterial part of total  revenue   However US   based Hewlett  Packard Company  HP  a global provider of  technology and software solutions  might reasonably be included in more than one  category  Investors interested in the personal computer  PC  industry for example  would probably include HP in their peer group but investors constructing a peer  group of providers of information technology services would probably include HP  in that group also  In summary analysts must distinguish between a company  s industry as defined  by one or more of the various classification systems and its peer group  A compa  ny  s peer group should consist of companies with similar business activities whose  economic activity depends on similar drivers of demand and similar factors related to  cost structure and access to financial capital  In practice these necessities frequently  result in a smaller group  even a different group  of companies than the most narrowly  defined categories used by the common commercial classification systems   Example    illustrates various aspects of developing and using peer groups  
5,211,EXAMPLE  
6,211,The Semiconductor Industry  Business  Cycle Sensitivity  and Peer  Group Determination
7,211,The GICS semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry          has  two sub  industries the semiconductor equipment sub  industry            and  the semiconductors sub  industry             Members of the semiconductor  equipment sub  industry include equipment suppliers such as Lam Research  Corporation and ASML Holdings NV  the semiconductors sub  industry includes  integrated circuit manufacturers Intel Corporation and Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company Ltd  Lam Research is a leading supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and  services to the world s semiconductor industry  Lam also offers wafer  cleaning  equipment that is used after many of the individual steps required to manu  facture a finished wafer  Often the technical advances that Lam introduces in

3,212,its wafer  etching and wafer  cleaning products are also available as upgrades to  its installed base  This benefit provides customers with a cost  effective way to  extend the performance and capabilities of their existing wafer fabrication lines   ASML describes itself as the world s leading provider of lithography systems   etching and printing on wafers  for the semiconductor industry  ASML manufac  tures complex machines that are critical to the production of integrated circuits  or microchips   ASML designs  develops  integrates  markets  and services these  advanced systems  which help chip makers reduce the size and increase the  functionality of microchips and consumer electronic equipment   The machines  are costly and thus represent a substantial capital investment for a purchaser  Based on revenue Intel is the world s largest semiconductor chip maker and  has the dominant share of microprocessors for the personal computer market    Intel has made significant investments in research and development  R D  to  introduce and produce new chips for new applications   Established in      Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  TSM  is one of  the world s largest dedicated semiconductor foundries  semiconductor fabrica  tion plants that execute the designs of other companies   TSM describes itself as  offering cutting  edge process technologies  pioneering design services  manufac  turing efficiency and product quality  The company  s revenues represent about     percent of the dedicated foundry segment in the semiconductor industry  The questions that follow take the perspective of early      when many  economies around the world were in a recession  Based only on the information  given answer the following questions      If the weak economy of early      were to recover within the next        months  which of the two sub  industries of the semiconductor and semi  conductor equipment industry would most likely be the first to experience  a positive improvement in business    Explain whether Intel and TSM should be considered members of the  same peer group    Explain whether Lam Research and ASML should be considered members  of the same peer group 
4,212,Solution to   
5,212,In the most likely scenario improvement in the business of the equipment makers   Lam and ASML  would lag that of semiconductor companies  Intel and TSM    Because of the weak economy of early      excess manufacturing capacity  should be available to meet increased demand for integrated circuits in the near  term without additional equipment  which is a major capital investment   When  semiconductor manufacturers believe the longer  term outlook has improved  they should begin to place orders for additional equipment  
6,212,Solution to   
7,212,Intel and TSM are not likely to be considered comparable members of the same  peer group because they have different sets of customers and different business  models   Intel designs and produces its own proprietary semiconductors for direct  sale to customers  such as personal computer makers   TSM provides design and  production services to a diverse group of integrated circuit suppliers that gen  erally do not have their own in  house manufacturing capabilities   In mid        Standard   Poor  s did not group Intel and TSM in the same peer group  Intel  was in the Semiconductors  Logic Larger Companies group and TSM was in  the Semiconductors  Foundry Services group

7,213,DESCRIBING AND ANALYZING AN INDUSTRY
8,213,In their work  analysts study statistical relationships between industry trends and  a range of economic and business variables   Analysts use economic industry and  business publications and internet resources as sources of information  They also seek  information from industry associations  from the individual subject companies they  are analyzing  and from these companies  competitors  suppliers  and customers   An  analyst with a superior knowledge about an industry  s characteristics  conditions  and  trends has a competitive edge in evaluating the investment merits of the companies  in the industry  Analysts attempt to develop practical reliable industry forecasts by using various  approaches to forecasting   They often estimate a range of projections for a variable  reflecting various possible scenarios   Analysts may seek to compare their projections  with the projections of other analysts  partly to study differences in methodology and  conclusions but also to identify differences between their forecasts and consensus  forecasts   These latter differences are extremely important for uncovering investment  opportunities because to be the basis for superior investment performance the forecast  for a value  relevant variable must be both correct and sufficiently different from the  consensus reflected in the price of publicly traded securities   Note that although some  information on analysts  revenue projections  EPS estimates  and ratings are accessible  in some markets  analysts may have limited access to details about other analysts  work  and assumptions because such details are kept confidential for competitive reasons   Investment managers and analysts also examine industry performance    in relation  to other industries to identify industries with superior inferior returns and    over  time to determine the degree of consistency stability and risk in the returns in the  industry over time  The objective of this analysis is to identify industries that offer  the highest potential for investment returns on a risk  adjusted basis   The investment  time horizon can be either long or short  as is the case for a rotation strategy in which  portfolios are rotated into the industry groups that are expected to benefit from the  next stage in the business cycle  Often analysts examine strategic groups  groups sharing distinct business models  or catering to specific market segments in an industry  almost as separate industries  within industries   Criteria for selecting a strategic group might include the complexity  of the product or service its mode of delivery and  barriers to entry   For example  charter airlines form a strategic group among  airlines  that is quite distinct from  scheduled airlines   full  service hotels form a strategic group that is separate from  limited  service or budget hotels   and companies that sell proprietary drugs  which are

3,214,protected by patents  would be in a separate group from companies that sell generic  drugs  which do not have patent protection  partly because the two groups pursue  different strategies and use different business models   Analysts often consider and classify industries according to industry life   cycle  stage  The analyst determines whether an industry is in the embryonic growth shake  out  mature or declining stage of the industry life cycle  During the stages of the life  cycle of a product or industry its position on the experience curve is often analyzed   The experience curve shows direct cost per unit of good or service produced or  delivered as a typically declining function of cumulative output   The curve declines     because as the utilization of capital equipment increases  fixed costs  administration  overhead advertising  etc   are spread over a larger number of units of production     because of improvements in labor efficiency and management of facilities  and     because of advances in production methods and product design  Examples exist in  virtually all industries  but the experience curve is especially important in industries  with high fixed overhead costs and or repetitive production operations  such as elec  tronics and appliance automobile and aircraft manufacturing   The industry life cycle  is discussed in depth later in this reading   Exhibit    provides a framework designed to help analysts check that they have  considered the range of forces that may affect the evolution of an industry  It shows   at the macro level macroeconomic demographic governmental social and techno  logical influences affecting the industry  It then depicts how an industry is affected by  the forces driving industry competition  threat of new entrants  substitution threats   customer and supplier bargaining forces  the competitive forces in the industry  life  cycle issues  business  cycle considerations  and position of the industry on the  experience curve  Exhibit    summarizes and brings together pictorially topics and  concepts discussed in this section

3,215,    Principles of Strategic Analysis
4,215,When analyzing an industry the analyst must recognize that the economic fundamen  tals can vary markedly among industries   Some industries are highly competitive with  most players struggling to earn adequate returns on capital whereas other industries  have attractive characteristics that allow almost all industry participants to generate  healthy profits   Exhibit    makes this point graphically  It shows the average spread  between return on invested capital  ROIC  and the cost of capital for    industries  from      through        Industries earning positive spreads appear to be earning  economic profits in the sense that they are achieving returns on investment above  the opportunity cost of funds   This result should create value that is  should increase  the wealth of the investors  who are the providers of capital  In contrast industries that  are realizing negative spreads are destroying value  As can be seen some industries  struggled to generate positive economic returns  i e  to create value  even during this  period of synchronized global growth while other industries did very well in earning  such returns

3,216,the context in which the company operates   Needless to say industry analysis must  be forward looking   Many of the industries in Exhibit   were very different    or     years ago and would have been placed differently with respect to value creation  many  will look very different    or    years from now  As analysts examine the competitive  structure of an industry they should always be thinking about what attributes could  change in the future  Analysis of the competitive environment with an emphasis on the implications  of the environment for corporate strategy is known as strategic analysis  Michael  Porter  s  five forces  framework is the classic starting point for strategic analysis     although it was originally aimed more at internal managers of businesses than at  external security analysts  the framework is useful to both   Porter        identified the following five determinants of the intensity of com  petition in an industry      The threat of entry to the industry which depends on barriers to entry or how  difficult it would be for new competitors to enter the industry  Industries that  are easy to enter will generally be more competitive than industries with high  barriers to entry     The power of suppliers which may be able to raise prices or restrict the supply  of key inputs to a company  For example workers at a heavily unionized com  pany may have greater bargaining power as suppliers of labor than workers at  a comparable non  unionized company  Suppliers of scarce or limited parts or  elements often possess significant pricing power     The power of buyers which can affect the intensity of competition by exerting  influence on suppliers regarding prices  and possibly other factors such as prod  uct quality   For example auto parts companies generally sell to a small number  of auto manufacturers  which allows those customers  the auto manufacturers   to be tough negotiators when it comes to setting prices      The threat of substitutes which can negatively affect demand if customers  choose other ways of satisfying their needs   For example consumers may trade  down from premium beers to discount brands during recessions   Low  priced  brands may be close substitutes for premium brands  which when consumer  budgets are constrained reduces the ability of premium brands to maintain or  increase prices   Substitutes do not have to be similar but can satisfy a need with  a very different product      The rivalry among existing competitors which is a function of the indus  try  s competitive structure  Industries that are fragmented among many small  competitors  have high fixed costs  provide undifferentiated  commodity  like   products  or have high exit barriers usually experience more intense rivalry than  industries without these characteristics   Although all five of these forces merit attention the first and fifth are particularly  recommended as a first focus for analysis   The two factors are broadly applicable  because all companies have competitors and must worry about new entrants to their  industries   Also in investigating these two forces  the analyst may become familiar in  detail with an industry  s incumbents and potential entrants  and all these companies   relative competitive prospects  
4,216,  See Porter           What aspects of a company are important may be different for internal and external analysts   Whether  information about competitive positions is accurately reflected in market prices  for example would be  relatively more important to external analysts

3,217,Addressing the following questions should help the analyst evaluate the threat  of new entrants and the level of competition in an industry and thereby provide an  effective base for describing and analyzing the industry      What are the barriers to entry  Is it difficult or easy for a new competitor to  challenge incumbents  Relatively high  low  barriers to entry imply that the  threat of new entrants is relatively low  high      How concentrated is the industry  Do a small number of companies control  a relatively large share of the market  or does the industry have many players   each with a small market share     What are capacity levels  That is  based on existing investment  how much of  the goods or services can be delivered in a given time frame  Does the industry  suffer chronic over  or under  capacity or do supply and demand tend to come  into balance reasonably quickly in the industry     How stable are market shares  Do companies tend to rapidly gain or lose share  or is the industry stable     Where is the industry in its life cycle  Does it have meaningful growth pros  pects  or is demand stagnant declining     How important is price to the customer  s purchase decision  The answers to these questions are elements of any thorough industry analysis  
4,217,      Barriers to Entry
5,217,When a company is earning economic profits  the chances that it will be able to  sustain them through time are greater all else being equal if the industry has high  barriers to entry  The ease with which new competitors can challenge incumbents is  often an important factor in determining the competitive landscape of an industry   If new competitors can easily enter the industry the industry is likely to be highly  competitive because high returns on invested capital will quickly be competed away by  new entrants eager to grab their share of economic profits   As a result  industries with  low barriers to entry often have little pricing power because price increases that raise  companies  returns on capital will eventually attract new competitors to the industry  If incumbents are protected by barriers to entry the threat of new entrants is  lower and incumbents may enjoy a more benign competitive environment   Often  these barriers to entry can lead to greater pricing power because potential competi  tors would find it difficult to enter the industry and undercut incumbents  prices   Of  course high barriers to entry do not guarantee pricing power because incumbents  may compete fiercely among each other  A classic example of an industry with low barriers to entry is restaurants   Anyone  with a modest amount of capital and some culinary skill can open a restaurant  and  popular restaurants quickly attract competition  As a result  the industry is very com  petitive and many restaurants fail in their first few years of business   At the other end of the spectrum of barriers to entry are the global credit card  networks such as MasterCard and Visa  both of which often post operating margins  greater than    percent   Such high profits should attract competition but the barri  ers to entry are extremely high  Capital costs are one hurdle  also building a massive  data  processing network would not be cheap  Imagine for a moment that a venture  capitalist was willing to fund the construction of a network that would replicate the  physical infrastructure of the incumbents the new card  processing company would  have to convince millions of consumers to use the new card and convince thousands  of merchants to accept the card  Consumers would not want to use a card that  merchants did not accept  and merchants would not want to accept a card that few
1,218,Describing and Analyzing an Industry
2,218,   
3,218,consumers carried  This problem would be difficult to solve which is why the barriers  to entering this industry are quite high  The barriers help preserve the profitability  of the incumbent players   One way of understanding barriers to entry is simply by thinking about what it  would take for new players to compete in an industry  How much money would they  need to spend  What kind of intellectual capital would they need to acquire  How  easy would it be to attract enough customers to become successful  Another way to investigate the issue is by looking at historical data   How often  have new companies tried to enter the industry  Is a list of industry participants today  markedly different from what it was five or ten years ago  These kinds of data can be  very helpful because the information is based on the real  world experience of many  entrepreneurs and businesses making capital allocation decisions   If an industry has  seen a flood of new entrants over the past several years  odds are good that the bar  riers are low   conversely if the same ten companies that dominate an industry today  dominated it ten years ago barriers to entry are probably fairly high  Do not confuse barriers to entry however with barriers to success  In some indus  tries  entering may be easy but becoming successful enough to threaten the incumbents  might be quite hard  For example in the United States  starting a mutual fund requires  a capital investment of perhaps US        not much of a barrier to an industry  with historically high returns on capital  But once one has started a mutual fund how  does the company gather assets  Financial intermediaries are unlikely to sell a mutual  fund with no track record  So the fund may need to incur operational losses for a  few years until it has established a good track record  Even with a track record the  fund will be competing in a crowded marketplace against companies with massive  advertising budgets and well  paid salespeople  In this industry good distribution  can be even more valuable than good performance  So although entering the asset  management industry may be relatively easy succeeding is another thing altogether  Also high barriers to entry do not automatically lead to good pricing power  and attractive industry economics   Consider the cases of auto making  commercial  aircraft manufacturing  and refining industries   Starting up a new company in any  of these industries would be tremendously difficult   Aside from the massive capital  costs  there would be significant other barriers to entry   A new automaker would  need manufacturing expertise and a dealer network   an aircraft manufacturer would  need a tremendous amount of intellectual capital  and a refiner would need process  expertise and regulatory approvals   Yet all of these industries are quite competitive with limited or nonexistent pricing  power and few industry participants reliably generate returns on capital in excess of  their costs of capital  Among the reasons for this seeming paradox of high barriers to  entry plus poor pricing power two stand out      First  price is a large component of the customer  s purchase decision when  buying from these companies in these industries   In some cases  the reason is  that the companies  e g   refiners  sell a commodity   in some cases  the prod  uct is expensive but has easily available substitutes   For example most airlines  choose between purchasing Boeing and Airbus airplanes not on brand but on  cost  related considerations   Airlines need to transport people and cargo at the  lowest possible cost per mile because the airlines have limited ability to pass  along higher costs to customers   That consideration makes price a huge compo  nent of their purchase decision  Most airlines purchase whichever plane is the
1,219,   
2,219,Reading      Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis
3,219,most cost efficient at any point in time  The result is that the Boeing Company  and Airbus have limited ability to price their planes at a level that generates  good returns on invested capital      Second these industries all have high barriers to exit  which means they are  prone to overcapacity  A refinery or automobile plant cannot be used for  anything other than respectively refining oil or producing cars  which makes  it hard to redeploy the capital elsewhere and exit the industry if conditions  become unprofitable  This barrier gives owners of these types of assets a strong  incentive to attempt to keep those loss  making plants operating  which of  course prolongs conditions of overcapacity  A final consideration when analyzing barriers to entry is that they can change  over time  Years ago a potential new entrant to the semiconductor industry would  have needed the capital and expertise to build a  fab   the industry term for a semi  conductor manufacturing plant   Chip fabs are hugely expensive and technologically  complex  which deterred potential new entrants   Starting in the mid      s  however  the outsourcing of chip making to contract semiconductor manufacturers became  feasible which meant that designers of chips could challenge the manufacturers  without the need to build their own plants   As a result  the industry became much  more fragmented through the late     s and into the first decade of the   st century  So in general high barriers to entry can lead to better pricing and less competitive  industry conditions  but important exceptions are worth bearing in mind 
4,219,      Industry Concentration
5,219,Much like industries with barriers to entry industries that are concentrated among  a relatively small number of players often experience relatively less price competi  tion  Again there are important exceptions  so the reader should not automatically  assume that concentrated industries always have pricing power or that fragmented  industries do not   An analysis of industry concentration should start with market share  What per  centage of the market does each of the largest players have and how large are those  shares relative to each other and relative to the remainder of the market  Often the  relative market shares of competitors matter as much as their absolute market shares   For example the global market for long  haul commercial aircraft is extremely  concentrated only Boeing and Airbus manufacture these types of planes   The two  companies have roughly similar market shares  however and control essentially the  entire market   Because neither enjoys a scale advantage relative to its competitor and  because any business gained by one is lost by the other competition tends to be fierce  This situation contrasts with the market for home improvement products in the  United States  which is dominated by Home Depot and Lowe s   These two companies  have    percent and   percent market share respectively which doesn t sound very  large  However the next largest competitor has only    percent of the market  and  most market participants are tiny with miniscule market shares   Both Home Depot  and Lowe s have historically posted high returns on invested capital in part because  they could profitably grow by targeting smaller competitors rather than engaging in  fierce competition with each other  Fragmented industries tend to be highly price competitive for several reasons    First  the large number of companies makes coordination difficult because there are  too many competitors for each industry member to monitor effectively  Second each  player has such a small piece of the market that even a small gain in market share can
6,219,  Neither company  s commercial aircraft segment has reliably generated returns on capital comfortably in  excess of the company  s cost of capital for many years   Boeing  s returns on capital have been respectable  overall but the company  s military segment is much more profitable than its commercial aircraft segment

3,220,make a meaningful difference to its fortunes  which increases the incentive of each  company to undercut prices and attempt to steal share  Finally the large number of  players encourages industry members to think of themselves individualistically rather  than as members of a larger group which can lead to fierce competitive behavior  In concentrated industries  in contrast  each player can relatively easily keep track  of what its competitors are doing  which makes tacit coordination much more feasible   Also leading industry members are large which means they have more to lose and  proportionately less to gain by destructive price behavior  Large companies are  also more tied to the fortunes of the industry as a whole making them more likely to  consider the long  run effects of a price war on overall industry economics   As with barriers to entry the level of industry concentration is a guideline rather  than a hard and fast rule when thinking about the level of pricing power in an indus  try  For example Exhibit    shows a rough classification of industries compiled by  Morningstar after asking its equity analysts whether industries were characterized  by strong or weak pricing power and whether those industries were concentrated or  fragmented  Examples of companies in industries are included in parentheses   In the  upper right quadrant   concentrated with weak pricing power   those industries that  are capital intensive and sell commodity  like products are shown in boldface

10,221,The industries in the top right quadrant defy the  concentration is good for pric  ing  guideline  We discussed the commercial aircraft manufacturing example in the  preceding section but many other industries are dominated by a small number of  players yet have difficult competitive environments and limited pricing power  When we examine these concentrated  yet  competitive industries  a clear theme  emerges   Many industries in this quadrant  the boldface ones  are highly capital inten  sive and sell commodity  like products   As we saw in the discussion of exit barriers   capital  intensive industries can be prone to overcapacity which mitigates the benefits  of industry concentration  Also if the industry sells a commodity product that is  difficult or impossible to differentiate the incentive to compete on price increases  because a lower price frequently results in greater market share    The computer memory market is a perfect example of a concentrated  yet   competitive industry  Dynamic random access memory  DRAM  is widely used in  PCs  and the industry is concentrated with about three  quarters of global market share  held by the top four companies   The industry is also highly capital intensive  a new fab  costs upwards of US   billion  But one DRAM chip is much like another and players  in this market have a huge economic incentive to capture market share because of the  large scale economies involved in running a semiconductor manufacturing plant   As  a result  price competition tends to be extremely fierce and industry concentration is  essentially a moot point in the face of these other competitive dynamics  
11,221,   There are a small number of concentrated and rational commodity industries  such as potash  a type  of fertilizer  and seaborne iron ore  What sets these industries apart is that they are hyper concentrated   The top two players control    percent of the global potash market  and the top three players control two   thirds of the global market for seaborne iron ore 
1,222,Describing and Analyzing an Industry
2,222,   
3,222,The global soft drink market is also highly concentrated of course but capital  requirements are relatively low and industry participants sell a differentiated product    Pepsi and Coca  Cola do not own their own bottling facilities  so a drop in market share  does not affect them as much as it would a memory  chip maker  Moreover although  memory  chip companies are assured of gaining market share and increasing sales  volumes by cutting prices  a sizable proportion of consumers would not switch from  Pepsi to Coke  or vice  versa  even if one cost much less than the other  Generally industry concentration is a good indicator that an industry has pricing  power and rational competition but other factors may override the importance of  concentration  Industry fragmentation is a much stronger signal that the industry is  competitive with limited pricing power  Notice how few fragmented industries are in  the bottom left quadrant in Exhibit    The industry characteristics discussed here are guidelines meant to steer the ana  lyst in a particular direction not rules that should cause the analyst to ignore other  relevant analytical factors

5,222,The effect on pricing of industry capacity  the maximum amount of a good or service  that can be supplied in a given time period  is clear   Tight  or limited capacity gives  participants more pricing power as demand for the product or service exceeds supply  whereas overcapacity leads to price cutting and a very competitive environment as  excess supply chases demand  An analyst should think about not only current capacity  conditions but future changes in capacity levels   How quickly can companies in the  industry adjust to fluctuations in demand  How flexible is the industry in bringing  supply and demand into balance  What will be the effect of that process on industry  pricing power or on industry margins  Generally capacity is fixed in the short term and variable in the long term because  capacity can be increased e g   new factories can be built if time is sufficient    What is considered  sufficient  time and therefore the duration of the short term  in which capacity cannot be increased may vary dramatically among industries    Sometimes  adding capacity takes years to complete as in the case of the construction  of a  greenfield   new  manufacturing plant for pharmaceuticals or for paper which  is complex and subject to regulatory requirements  e g   relating to the plant s waste    In other situations  capacity may be added or reduced relatively quickly as is the case  with service industries  such as advertising   In cyclical markets  such as commercial  paper and paperboard capacity conditions can change rapidly  Strong demand in  the early stages of an economic recovery can result in the addition of supply  Given  the long lead times to build manufacturing plants  new supply may reach the market  just as demand slows  rapidly changing capacity conditions from tight to loose  Such  considerations underscore the importance of forecasting long  term industry demand  in evaluating industry investments in capacity  One of the more dramatic examples of this process in recent years occurred in the  market for maritime dry  bulk shipping during the commodity boom of             Rapid industrialization in China combined with synchronized global economic  growth increased demand for cargo ships that could transport iron ore coal grains   and other high  volume low  value commodities   Given that the supply of cargo ships  could not be increased very quickly  because ships take time to build and large com  mercial shipyards typically have multi  year backlogs  shippers naturally raised prices  to take advantage of the tight global cargo capacity  In fact  the price to charter the  largest type of dry  bulk vessel a Capesize  class ship too big to fit through the Panama  Canal increased more than fivefold in only a year from approximately US        per day in early      to almost US        per day by late

3,223,As one would expect  orders for new dry  bulk carriers skyrocketed during this  period as the industry scrambled to add shipping capacity to take advantage of  seemingly insatiable demand and very favorable pricing   In early      the number  of dry  bulk carriers on order from shipyards represented approximately     percent  of the worldwide fleet   By late      the number of bulk ships on order represented  almost    percent of the global bulk fleet     Of course the prospect of this additional  capacity combined with a dramatic slump in aggregate global demand for commod  ities  caused a massive decline in shipping rates   Capesize charter rates plummeted  from the US        day high of late      to a low of under US       per day just  one year later  In this example the conditions of tight supply that were driving strong dry  bulk  pricing were quite clear and these high prices drove attractive returns on capital and  share  price performance for dry  bulk  shipping companies   However the careful  analyst would have looked at future additions to supply in the form of new ships on  order and would have forecasted that the tight supply conditions were not sustainable  and thus that the pricing power of dry  bulk shippers was short  lived  These predictions  are in fact  precisely what occurred  Note that capacity need not be physical  After Hurricane Katrina caused enormous  damage to the southeastern United States in      reinsurance rates quickly spiked  as customers sought to increase their financial protection from future hurricanes    However these high reinsurance rates enticed a flood of fresh capital into the rein  surance market  and a number of new reinsurance companies were founded which  brought rates back down  Generally if new capacity is physical for example an auto manufacturing plant  or a massive cargo ship it will take longer for new capacity to come on line to meet  an increase in demand resulting in a longer period of tight conditions   Unfortunately  capacity additions frequently overshoot long  run demand and because physical cap  ital is often hard to re  deploy industries reliant on physical capacity may get stuck in  conditions of excess capacity and diminished pricing power for an extended period  Financial and human capital in contrast can be quickly shifted to new uses   In the  reinsurance example for instance financial capital was quick to enter the reinsurance  market and take advantage of tight capacity conditions  but if too much capital had  entered the market  some portion of that capital could easily have left to seek higher  returns elsewhere  Money can be used for many things  but massive bulk cargo vessels  are not useful for much more than transporting heavy goods across oceans  
4,223,      Market Share Stability
5,223,Examining the stability of industry market shares over time is similar to thinking  about barriers to entry and the frequency with which new players enter an industry   In fact  barriers to entry and the frequency of new product introductions  together  with such factors as product differentiation all affect market shares   Stable market  shares typically indicate less competitive industries   unstable market shares often  indicate highly competitive industries that have limited pricing power  A comparison of two non  commodity markets in the health care sector illustrates  this point  Over the past decade the orthopedic device industry mainly artificial hips  and knees has been a relatively stable global oligopoly  As Exhibit    indicates  five  companies control about    percent of the worldwide market  and the market shares  of those companies have changed by only small amounts over the past several years

16,224,In contrast  although the US market for stents small metal mesh devices used  to prop open blocked arteries is also controlled by a handful of companies  market  shares recently have gone from being very stable to being marked by rapid change   Johnson   Johnson which together with Boston Scientific dominated the US stent  market for many years  went from having about half the market in      to having  only     percent in early       over the same period Abbott Laboratories increased  its market share from zero to    percent   The reason for this change was the launch  of new stents by Abbott and Medtronic which took market share from Johnson    Johnson and Boston Scientific  s established stents   Orthopedic device companies have experienced more stability in their market  shares for two reasons   First  artificial hips and knees are complicated to implant  and  each manufacturer  s products are slightly different   As a result  orthopedic surgeons  become proficient at using one or several companies  devices and may be reluctant  to incur the time and cost of learning how to implant products from a competing  company  The second reason is the relatively slow pace of innovation in the orthopedic  device industry which tends to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary making the  benefit of switching among product lines relatively low  In addition the number of  orthopedic device companies has remained fairly static over many years   In contrast  the US stent market has experienced rapid shifts in market shares  because of several factors   First  interventional cardiologists seem to be more open  than orthopedic surgeons to implanting stents from different manufacturers   that  tendency may reflect lower switching costs for stents relative to orthopedic devices    More importantly however the pace of innovation in the stent market has become  quite rapid giving cardiologists added incentive to switch to newer stents  with  potentially better patient outcomes  as they became available  Low switching costs plus a relatively high benefit from switching caused market  shares to change quickly in the stent market   High switching costs for orthopedic  devices coupled with slow innovation resulted in a lower benefit from switching   which led to greater market share stability in orthopedic devices

3,226,of new competitors entering the industry is usually highest during the growth stage  when barriers to entry are relatively low  Competition tends to be relatively limited  however because rapidly expanding demand provides companies with an opportunity to  grow without needing to capture market share from competitors  Industry profitability  improves as volumes rise and economies of scale are attained  Shakeout The shakeout stage is usually characterized by slowing growth intense  competition and declining profitability  During the shakeout stage demand approaches  market saturation levels because few new customers are left to enter the market   Competition is intense as growth becomes increasingly dependent on market share  gains   Excess industry capacity begins to develop as the rate at which companies con  tinue to invest exceeds the overall growth of industry demand  In an effort to boost  volumes to fill excess capacity companies often cut prices  so industry profitability  begins to decline  During the shakeout stage companies increasingly focus on reducing  their cost structure  restructuring  and building brand loyalty  Marginal companies  may fail or merge with others   Mature Characteristics of a mature industry include little or no growth industry  consolidation and relatively high barriers to entry  Industry growth tends to be limited  to replacement demand and population expansion because the market at this stage is  completely saturated  As a result of the shakeout mature industries often consolidate  and become oligopolies   The surviving companies tend to have brand loyalty and rel  atively efficient cost structures  both of which are significant barriers to entry  During  periods of stable demand companies in mature industries tend to recognize their  interdependence and try to avoid price wars   Periodic price wars do occur however  most notably during periods of declining demand  such as during economic down  turns   Companies with superior products or services are likely to gain market share  and experience above  industry  average growth and profitability  Decline During the decline stage industry growth turns negative excess capacity  develops  and competition increases   Industry demand at this stage may decline for a  variety of reasons  including technological substitution  for example the newspaper  industry has been declining for years as more people turn to the internet and     hour  cable news networks for information  social changes  and global competition  for  example low  cost foreign manufacturers pushing the US textile industry into decline    As demand falls  excess capacity in the industry forms and companies respond by  cutting prices  which often leads to price wars   The weaker companies often exit the  industry at this point merge or redeploy capital into different products and services   When overall demand for an industry  s products or services is declining  the  opportunity for individual companies to earn above  average returns on invested  capital tends to be less than when demand is stable or increasing  because of price  cutting and higher per  unit costs as production is cut back   Example    deals with  industry life cycles

2,227,Reading      Introduction to Industry and Company Analysis
3,227,Solution 
4,227,Increasing industry demand as forecasted in      would have given companies  in the prefabricated housing industry the opportunity to grow without taking  market share from one another mitigating the intensity of competition in this  industry  Under actual industry circumstances of declining demand and a shrink  ing market  in contrast  revenue growth for a prefabricated housing company  could happen only through market share gains from its competitors  
5,227,        Using an Industry Life  Cycle Model
6,227,In general new industries tend to be  more competitive  with lots of players entering and exiting  than mature industries   which often have stable competitive environments and players that are more inter  ested in protecting what they have than in gaining lots of market share  However as  industries move from maturity to decline competitive pressures may increase again  as industry participants perceive a zero  sum environment and fight over pieces of an  ever  shrinking pie  An important point for the analyst to think about is whether a company is  act  ing its age  relative to where its industry sits in the life cycle  Companies in growth  industries should be building customer loyalty as they introduce consumers to new  products or services  building scale and reinvesting heavily in their operations to  capitalize on increasing demand  They are probably not focusing strongly on internal  efficiency  These companies are rather like young adults  who are reinvesting their  human and financial capital with the goal of becoming more successful in life  Growth  companies typically reinvest their cash flows in new products and product platforms  rather than returning cash flows to shareholders because these companies still have  many opportunities to deploy their capital to make positive returns   Although this  analogy to the human life cycle is a helpful way to think about the model the analyst  should also be aware that the analogy is not exact in detail  Long  established compa  nies sometimes find a way to accelerate growth through innovation or by expansion  into new markets   Humans cannot really move back to the days of youth  So a more  precise formulation may be  acting its stage  rather than acting its age  Companies in mature industries are likely to be pursuing replacement demand  rather than new buyers and are probably focused on extending successful product  lines rather than introducing revolutionary new products   They are also probably  focusing on cost rationalization and efficiency gains rather than on taking lots of  market share  Importantly these companies have fewer growth opportunities than in  the previous stage and thus more limited avenues for profitably reinvesting capital  but they often have strong cash flows   Given their strong cash flows and relatively  limited reinvestment opportunities  such companies should be according to a com  mon perspective returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases or dividends    These companies are rather like middle  aged adults who are harvesting the fruits of  their success earlier in life  What can be a concern is a middle  aged company acting like a young  growth  company and pouring capital into projects with low ROIC prospects in an effort to  pursue size for its own sake  Many companies have a difficult time managing the  transition from growth to maturity and their returns on capital and shareholder  returns may suffer until management decides to allocate capital in a manner more  appropriate to the company  s life  cycle stage  For example three large US retailers Walmart Home Depot and McDonalds all  went through the transition to maturity in the first decade of the   st century  At various  times between      and      these companies realized that their size and industry  dominance meant that the days of double  digit growth that was driven largely by new  store  restaurant  openings were a thing of the past   All three reallocated capital away  from opening new stores to other areas namely increased inventory efficiency  Home

4,228,        Limitations of Industry Life  Cycle Analysis Although models can provide a
5,228,useful framework for thinking about an industry the evolution of an industry does not  always follow a predictable pattern  Various external factors may significantly affect the  shape of the pattern causing some stages to be longer or shorter than expected and  in certain cases  causing some stages to be skipped altogether  Technological changes may cause an industry to experience an abrupt shift from  growth to decline thus skipping the shakeout and mature stages   For example tran  sistors replaced vacuum tubes in the     s at a time when the vacuum tube industry  was still in its growth stage  word processors replaced typewriters in the     s   and  today the movie rental industry is experiencing rapid change as consumers increas  ingly turn to on  demand services such as downloading movies from the internet or  through their cable providers   Regulatory changes can also have a profound impact on the structure of an indus  try  A prime example is the deregulation of the US telecommunications industry in  the     s  which transformed a monopolistic industry into an intensely competitive  one  AT T was broken into regional service providers  and many new long distance  telephone service entrants  such as Sprint  emerged  The result was a wider range of  product and service offerings and lower consumer prices   Changes in government  reimbursement rates for health care products and services may  and have  affected  the profitability of companies in the health care industry globally  Social changes also have the ability to affect the profile of an industry  The casual  dining industry has benefited over the past    years from the increase in the number  of dual  income families  who often have more income but less time to cook meals  to eat at home  Demographics also play an important role  As the Baby Boom generation ages  for  instance industry demand for health care services is likely to increase  Thus  life  cycle models tend to be most useful for analyzing industries during peri  ods of relative stability  They are less practical when the industry may be experiencing  rapid change because of external or other special circumstances   Another limiting factor of models is that not all companies in an industry experi  ence similar performances   The key objective for the analyst is to identify the poten  tial winners while avoiding potential losers   Highly profitable companies can exist in  competitive industries with below  average profitability and vice versa   For example  Nokia has historically been able to use its scale to generate levels of profitability that  are well above average despite operating in a highly competitive industry  In contrast   despite the historically above  average growth and profitability of the software industry  countless examples exist of software companies that failed to ever generate a profit  and eventually went out of business

8,229,      Price Competition
9,229,A highly useful tool for analyzing an industry is attempting to think like a customer of  the industry  Whatever factor most influences customer purchase decisions is likely to  also be the focus of competitive rivalry in the industry  In general industries for which  price is a large factor in customer purchase decisions tend to be more competitive  than industries in which customers value other attributes more highly  Although this depiction may sound like the description of a commodity industry  versus a non  commodity industry it is  in fact  a bit more subtle  Commercial aircraft  and passenger cars are certainly more differentiated than lumps of coal or gallons of  gasoline but price nonetheless weighs heavily in the purchase decisions of buyers  of aircraft and cars  because fairly good substitutes are easily available  If Airbus  charges too much for an A    an airline can buy a Boeing        If BMW  s price for  a four  door luxury sedan rises too high customers can switch to a Mercedes or other  luxury brand with similar features   Similar switching can be expected as a result of a  unilateral price increase in the case of most industries in the  Weak Pricing Power   column of Exhibit    Contrast these industries with asset management  one of a handful of industries  that is both fragmented and characterized by strong pricing power  Despite the well   documented impact of fees on future investment returns  the vast majority of asset  management customers do not make decisions on the basis of price  Instead asset  management customers focus on historical returns  which allow this highly fragmented  industry to maintain strong pricing power  Granted the index fund arena is very price  competitive because any index fund is a perfect substitute for another fund tracking  the same benchmark   But the active management segment of the industry has generally  been able to price its products in an implicitly cooperative fashion that enables most  players to generate consistently high returns on capital presumably because price is  not uppermost in the mind of a prospective mutual fund investor 
10,229,   A small amount of  path dependence  characterizes the airline industry in that an airline with a large  fleet of a particular Airbus model will be marginally more likely to stick with that model for a new purchase  than it will be to buy a Boeing  but the aircraft manufacturers  ability to exploit this likelihood is minimal

2,230,   
3,230,Returning to a more capital  intensive industry consider heavy  equipment manu  facturers  such as Caterpillar Deere and Komatsu  A large wheel loader or combine  harvester requires a large capital outlay so price certainly plays a part in the buyers   decisions   However other factors are important enough to customers to allow these  companies a small amount of pricing power  Construction equipment is typically used  as a complement to other gear on a large project  which means that downtime for  repairs increases costs because for example hourly laborers must wait for a bulldozer  to be fixed  Broken equipment is also expensive for agricultural users  who may have  only a few days in which to harvest a season s crop  Because of the importance to users  of their products  reliability and their large service networks which are important   differentiators  or factors bestowing a competitive advantage Caterpillar Komatsu  and Deere have historically been able to price their equipment at levels that have  generated solid returns on invested capital

7,233,    External Influences on Industry Growth Profitability  and Risk
8,233,External factors affecting an industry  s growth include macroeconomic technological  demographic governmental and social influences  
9,233,      Macroeconomic Influences
10,233,Trends in overall economic activity generally have significant effects on the demand  for an industry  s products or services   These trends can be cyclical  i e  related to the  changes in economic activity caused by the business cycle  or structural  i e  related  to enduring changes in the composition or magnitude of economic activity   Among  the economic variables that usually affect an industry  s revenues and profits are the  following     gross domestic product or the measure of the value of goods and services  produced by an economy either in current or constant currency  inflation   adjusted  terms      interest rates  which represent the cost of debt to consumers and businesses and  are important ingredients in financial institutions  revenues and costs      the availability of credit  which affects business and consumer spending and  financial solvency   and    inflation which reflects the changes in prices of goods and services and influ  ences costs  interest rates  and consumer and business confidence 
11,233,      Technological Influences
12,233,New technologies create new or improved products that can radically change an  industry and can also change how other industries that use the products conduct  their operations   The computer hardware industry provides one of the best examples of how tech  nological change can affect industries   The      invention of the microchip  also  known as an  integrated circuit   which is effectively a computer etched on a sliver of  silicon  enabled the computer hardware industry to eventually create a new market of  personal computing for the general public and radically extended the use of computers  in business  government  and educational institutions   Moore s law states that the number of transistors that can be inexpensively placed  on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years   Several other mea  sures of digital technology have improved at exponential rates related to Moore s law  including the size cost  density and speed of components   As a result of these trends   the computer hardware industry encroached upon and in time came to dominate the  fields of hardware for word processing and many forms of electronic communication  and home entertainment   The computing industry  s integrated circuit innovation

3,234,increased economies of scale and erected large barriers to new entrants because the  capital costs of innovation and production became very high  Intel capitalized on  both factors which allowed it to garner an industry market leadership position and  to become the dominant supplier of the PC industry  s highest value component  the  microprocessor   Thus  Intel became dominant because of its cost advantage brand  power and access to capital  Along the way the computer hardware industry was supported and greatly assisted  by the complementary industries of computer software and telecommunications   particularly in regard to development of the internet   also important were other  industries entertainment  television movies  games  retailing  and the print media    Ever more powerful integrated circuits and advances in wireless technology as well  as the convergence of media  which the internet and new wireless technology have  facilitated continue to reshape the uses and the roles of PC hardware in business and  personal life  In the middle of the   th century few people in the world would have  imagined they would ever have any use for a home computer  Today the estimate is  that about     billion people or almost a quarter of the world s population have access  to connected computing   For the United States  the estimate is at least    percent of  the population  it is much less in emerging and underdeveloped countries   More than     billion mobile cellular telephone subscriptions exist in the world today   and the  advances of mobile telephony appear poised to increase this figure dramatically in the  years ahead as mobile phone and computer hardware technologies merge to provide  new hand  held computing and communication capabilities   Another example of the effects of technology on an industry is the impact of dig  ital imaging technology on the photographic film industry  Digital imaging uses an  electronic image sensor to record an image as electronic data rather than as chemical  changes on film  This difference allows a much greater degree of image processing and  transmission than in film photography  Since their invention in      digital cameras  have become extremely popular and now widely outsell traditional film cameras   although many professional photographers continue to use film for esthetic reasons  for certain applications   Digital cameras include such features as video and audio  recording   The effects of this major change in photographic technology have caused  film and camera manufacturers including Kodak  Fujifilm Nikon Corporation and  Pentax Imaging Company to completely restructure and redesign their products to  adapt to the new technology  s appeal to consumers  
4,234,      Demographic Influences
5,234,Changes in population size in the distributions of age and gender and in other demo  graphic characteristics may have significant effects on economic growth and on the  amounts and types of goods and services consumed  The effects of demographics on industries are well exemplified by the impact of the  post World War II Baby Boom in North America on demand for goods and services    Born between      and      this bulge of    million people in the North American  population has influenced the composition of numerous products and services it  needs in its passage from the cradle through childhood adolescence early adulthood  middle age and into retirement   The teenage pop culture of the late     s and     s  and all the products  records  movies  clothes  and fashions associated with it  the  surge in demand for housing in the     s and     s  and the increasing demand for  retirement  oriented investment products in the     s and early     s are all examples  of the range of industries affected by this demographic bulge working its way through  age categories of the population

3,235,Another example of the effects of demographics on industries is the impact of an  aging population in Japan which has one of the highest percentages of elderly residents       percent over the age of     and a very low birth rate  Japan s ministry of health  estimates that by      the percentage of the population over    will rise to    per  cent and the total population will fall by    percent   These demographic changes are  expected by some observers to have negative effects on the overall economy because  essentially they imply a declining workforce  However some sectors of the economy  stand to benefit from these trends for example the health care industry 
4,235,EXAMPLE  
5,235,The Post World War II Baby Boom and Its Effects on the  US Housing Industry
6,235,In the United States  Canada  and Australia  the end of World War II marked the  beginning of a sustained period of elevated birth rates per thousand in the pop  ulation  This rise reflected the relief from the hardships of the Great Depression  of the     s and WWII increased levels of immigration  immigrants tend to  be younger and hence more fertile than average  and a protracted period of  postwar economic prosperity  The rate of births in the United States rose from       per thousand in      and      per thousand in      to      per thousand  in      and a peak of more than      per thousand in            Twenty years  later when the babies born during the period           entered adulthood  the housing industry experienced a surge in demand that led to a period of high  sales of new homes   The rate of new housing starts in this period rose from       per thousand of population in      to a peak of      per thousand in      and  remained elevated except during the economic recession of           until  the end of the     s   Another demographic effect on the housing industry arising from the post   WWII Baby Boom came from the children of the Baby Boom generation  the  so  called Echo Boomers   The Echo Boomers started to enter their most fertile  years in the late     s and caused an increase in the number of births per thou  sand from a post  WWII low of      in      to a peak of      in       The Echo  Boomers did not have as large an effect on housing demand    years later as  their parents had had but there was still a significant increase in new housing  starts from      per thousand in      to a high of      per thousand in        easily available mortgage financing contributed to the increase 
7,235,      Governmental Influences
8,235,Governmental influence on industries  revenues and profits is pervasive and important   In setting tax rates and rules for corporations and individuals  governments affect profits  and incomes  which in turn affect corporate and personal spending   Governments  are also major purchasers of goods and services from a range of industries   Example     illustrates the sudden shifts in wealth that can occur when govern  ments step in to support or quash a securities market innovation  In the example an  income trust refers to a type of equity ownership vehicle established as a trust issuing  ownership shares known as units   Income trusts became extremely popular among  income  oriented investors in Canada in the late     s and early     s because under  then  current regulation such trusts could avoid taxation on income distributed to  unit  holders  investors  that is  avoid double taxation  once at the corporate level  and once at the investor level   As Example    describes  the tax advantage that reg  ulations permitted was eventually removed

3,236,EXAMPLE   
4,236,The Effects of Tax Increases on Income Trusts in Canada
5,236,On    October      in an effort to halt the rapid growth of income trust struc  tures in the Canadian stock market Canada s Minister of Finance James Flaherty  announced that these tax  exempt flow  through entities would in the future be  taxable on the income with exemptions only for passive rent  collecting real  estate investment trusts   A five year hiatus was established for existing trusts to  adapt   He stated that the government needed to clamp down on trusts because  too many companies were converting to the high  yield securities  primarily to  save taxes   The S P TSX Capped Income Trust Index declined    percent on  the day after the announcement  wiping out C    billion in market value 
6,236,Often governments exert their influence indirectly by empowering other regu  latory or self  regulatory organizations  e g   stock exchanges  medical associations   utility rate setters  and other regulatory commissions  to govern the affairs of an  industry  By setting the terms of entry into various sectors  such as financial services  and health care and the rules that companies and individuals must adhere to in these  fields  governments control the supply quality and nature of many products and  services and the public  s access to them  For example in the financial industry the  acceptance of savings deposits from and the issuance of securities to the investing  public are usually tightly controlled by governments and their agencies   This control  is imposed through rules designed to protect investors from fraudulent operators and  to ensure that investors receive adequate disclosure about the nature and risks of their  investments   Another example is that medical patients in most developed countries  are treated by doctors who are trained according to standards set by medical asso  ciations acting as self  regulatory organizations empowered under government laws    In addition the medications that patients receive must be approved by government  agencies   In a somewhat different vein users of tobacco products purchase items for  which the marketing and sales taxes are heavily controlled by governments in most  developed countries and for which warnings to consumers about the dangers of smok  ing are mandated by governments   In the case of industries that supply branches of  government  such as the military public works  and law enforcement departments   government contracts directly affect the revenues and profits of the suppliers

8,236,The Effects of Government Purchases on the Aerospace  Industry
9,236,The aerospace construction and firearms industries are prime examples of  industries for which governments are major customers and whose revenues and  profits are significantly in some cases  predominantly affected by their sales  to governments   An example is the European Aeronautic Defence and Space  Company  EADS  a global leader in aerospace defense and related services  with head offices in Paris and Ottobrunn Germany  In      EADS generated  revenues of        billion and employed an international workforce of about          EADS includes Airbus  a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft    Airbus Military providing tanker transport and mission aircraft   Eurocopter the  world s largest helicopter supplier   and EADS Astrium the European leader in  space programs  including Ariane and Galileo  Its Defence   Security Division  is a provider of comprehensive systems solutions and makes EADS the major

4,237,      Social Influences
5,237,Societal changes involving how people work  spend their money enjoy their leisure  time and conduct other aspects of their lives can have significant effects on the sales  of various industries   Tobacco consumption in the United Kingdom provides a good example of the  effects of social influences on an industry  Although the role of government in curbing  tobacco advertising  legislating health warnings on the purchases of tobacco products   and banning smoking in public places  such as restaurants  bars  public houses  and  transportation vehicles  probably has been the most powerful apparent instrument of  changes in tobacco consumption the forces underlying that change have really been  social in nature namely increasing consciousness on the part of the population of  the damage to the health of tobacco users and those in their vicinity from smoking   the increasing cost to individuals and governments of the chronic illnesses caused by  tobacco consumption and the accompanying shift in public perception of smokers  from socially correct to socially incorrect even inconsiderate or reckless   As a result  of these changes in society  s views of smoking  cigarette consumption in the United  Kingdom declined from        billion cigarettes in      to less than       billion in       placing downward pressure on tobacco companies  unit sales

7,237,The Effects on Various Industries of More Women Entering  the Workforce
8,237,In      women accounted for only    percent of the workforce in the United  States outside the home  By      after two world wars and the Great Depression  this figure had risen to    percent  it had been even higher temporarily during  WWII because of high levels of war  mandated production  and by      to     percent   Based on economic reasoning  identify four industries that should  have benefitted from the social change that saw women shift from their most  frequent historical roles in Western society as full  time homemakers to becoming  more frequently full  time participants in the workforce 
9,237,Solution 
10,237,Industries include the following    The restaurant business   The restaurant business stands to benefit from  an increased demand given that women because of their work responsi  bilities  may not have the time and energy to prepare meals   Restaurant  industry growth was actually high in this period  From accounting for only     percent of every food dollar in the United States in      the restaurant  industry today consumes more than    percent of every food dollar with     percent of current industry revenues arising from a category of restau  rant that did not exist in      namely fast food    Manufacturers of work clothing for women    Home and child care services

5,238,The Airline Industry  A Case Study of Many Influences
6,238,The global airline industry exemplifies many of the concepts and influences we  have discussed 
7,238,Life   Cycle Stage
8,238,The industry can be described as having some mature characteristics because  average annual growth in global passenger traffic has remained relatively stable at      percent in the     s  compared with     percent in the     s   Some market  segments in the industry however are still in their growth phase notably the  markets of the Middle East and Asia  which are expected to grow at     percent  compared with projected North American growth of     percent over the next     years  
9,238,Sensitivity to Business Cycle
10,238,The airline industry is a cyclical industry   global economic activity produces  swings in revenues and especially profitability because of the industry  s high  fixed costs and operating leverage  In      for example global passenger traffic is  expected to have declined by approximately   percent and airlines are expected to  report significant net losses close to US     billion which is down from a global  industry profit of US      billion in       The industry tends to respond early  to upward and downward moves in economic cycles   depending on the region  air travel changes at     times to     times GDP growth  It is highly regulated  with governments and airport authorities playing a large role in allocating routes  and airport slots   Government agencies and the International Airline Transport  Association set rules for aircraft and flight safety  Airline customers tend to have  low brand loyalty  except at the extremes of high and low prices and service    leisure travelers focus mainly on price and business travelers focus mostly on  schedules and service  Product and service differentiation at particular price  points is low because aircraft  cabin configuration and catering tend to be quite  similar in most cases   For leisure travelers  the price competition is intense and  is led by low  cost discount carriers  including Southwest Airlines in the United  States  Ryanair in Europe and Air Asia in Asia   For business travelers  the  major scheduled airlines and a few service  quality specialists  such as Singapore  Airlines  are the main contenders   Fuel costs  typically more than     percent  of total costs and highly volatile  and labor costs  around     percent of total  costs  have been the focus of management cost  reduction efforts   The airline  industry is highly unionized and labor strife has frequently been a source of  costly disruptions to the industry  Technology has always played a major role in  the airline industry from its origins with small propeller  driven planes through  the advent of the jet age to the drive for greater fuel efficiency since the oil price  increases of the     s   Technology also poses a threat to the growth of business

5,239,COMPANY ANALYSIS
6,239,Company analysis includes an analysis of the company  s financial position products  and or services  and competitive strategy  its plans for responding to the threats and  opportunities presented by the external environment   Company analysis takes place  after the analyst has gained an understanding of a company  s external environment   the macroeconomic demographic governmental technological and social forces  influencing the industry  s competitive structure  The analyst should seek to determine  whether the strategy is primarily defensive or offensive in its nature and how the  company intends to implement the strategy  Porter identifies two chief competitive strategies   a low  cost strategy  cost lead  ership  and a product service differentiation strategy  In a low  cost strategy companies strive to become the low  cost producers and to  gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their  competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate  of return based on the higher revenues achieved  Low  cost strategies may be pursued  defensively to protect market positions and returns or offensively to gain market  share and increase returns   Pricing also can be defensive  when the competitive envi  ronment is one of low rivalry  or aggressive  when rivalry is intense   In the case of  intense rivalry pricing may even become predatory that is  aimed at rapidly driving  competitors out of business at the expense of near  term profitability  The hope in  such a strategy is that having achieved a larger market share the company can later  increase prices to generate higher returns than before  For example the predatory  strategy has been alleged by some analysts to have been followed by major airlines  trying to protect lucrative routes from discount airlines   Although laws concerning  anti  competitive practices often prohibit predatory pricing to gain market share in  most cases  it is difficult to accurately ascribe the costs of products or services with  sufficient precision to demonstrate that predatory pricing  as opposed to intense but  fair price competition  is occurring   Companies seeking to follow low  cost strategies  must have tight cost controls  efficient operating and reporting systems  and appro  priate managerial incentives   In addition they must commit themselves to painstaking  scrutiny of production systems and their labor forces and to low  cost designs and  product distribution  They must be able to invest in productivity  improving capital  equipment and to finance that investment at a low cost of capital  In differentiation strategies  companies attempt to establish themselves as the  suppliers or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality type  or means of distribution  To be successful their price premiums must be above their  costs of differentiation and the differentiation must be appealing to customers and  sustainable over time  Corporate managers who successfully pursue differentiation  strategies tend to have strong market research teams to identify and match customer  needs with product development and marketing   Such a strategy puts a premium on  employing creative and inventive people

8,243,Spreadsheet modeling of financial statements to analyze and forecast revenues  oper  ating and net income and cash flows has become one of the most widely used tools in  company analysis   Although spreadsheet models are a valuable tool for understanding  past financial performance and forecasting future performance the complexity of such  models can at times be a problem  Because modeling requires the analyst to predict  and input numerous items in financial statements  there is a risk of errors either  in assumptions made or in formulas in the model which can compound leading to  erroneous forecasts   Yet  those forecasts may seem precise because of the sheer com  plexity of the model  The result is often a false sense of understanding and security  on the part of those who rely on the models   To guard against this  before or after a  model is completed a  reality check  of the model is useful  Such testing for reasonableness can be done by first  asking what the few most  important changes in income statement items are likely to be from last year to this  year and the next year and second attempting to quantify the effects of these signif  icant changes or  swing factors  on the bottom line  If an analyst cannot summarize  in a few points what factors are realistically expected to change income from year to  year and is not convinced that these assumptions are correct  then he or she does not  really understand the output of the computer modeling efforts   In general financial  models should be in a format that matches the company  s reporting of its financial  results or supplementary disclosures or that can be accurately derived from these  reports   Otherwise there will be no natural reality check when the company issues  its financial results and the analyst will not be able to compare his or her estimates  with actual reported results

9,255,Analysts gather and process information to make investment decisions  including  buy and sell recommendations   What information is gathered and how it is processed  depend on the analyst and the purpose of the analysis   Technical analysis uses such  information as stock price and trading volume as the basis for investment decisions    Fundamental analysis uses information about the economy industry and company  as the basis for investment decisions   Examples of fundamentals are unemployment  rates  gross domestic product  GDP  growth industry growth and quality of and  growth in company earnings   Whereas technical analysts use information to predict  price movements and base investment decisions on the direction of predicted change  in prices  fundamental analysts use information to estimate the value of a security  and to compare the estimated value to the market price and then base investment  decisions on that comparison  This reading introduces equity valuation models used to estimate the intrinsic value   synonym  fundamental value  of a security   intrinsic value is based on an analysis  of investment fundamentals and characteristics   The fundamentals to be considered  depend on the analyst s approach to valuation  In a top  down approach an analyst  examines the economic environment  identifies sectors that are expected to prosper  in that environment  and analyzes securities of companies from previously identified  attractive sectors   In a bottom  up approach an analyst typically follows an industry or  industries and forecasts fundamentals for the companies in those industries in order  to determine valuation  Whatever the approach an analyst who estimates the intrinsic  value of an equity security is implicitly questioning the accuracy of the market price  as an estimate of value  Valuation is particularly important in active equity portfolio  management  which aims to improve on the return risk trade  off of a portfolio s  benchmark by identifying mispriced securities   This reading is organized as follows   Section   discusses the implications of dif  ferences between estimated value and market price  Section   introduces three major  categories of valuation model  Section   presents an overview of present value models  with a focus on the dividend discount model  Section   describes and examines the  use of multiples in valuation  Section   explains asset  based valuation and demon  strates how these models can be used to estimate value  Section   states conclusions  and summarizes the reading

4,256,ESTIMATED VALUE AND MARKET PRICE
5,256,By comparing estimates of value and market price an analyst can arrive at one of  three conclusions   The security is undervalued overvalued or fairly valued in the  marketplace  For example if the market price of an asset is     and the analyst esti  mates intrinsic value at     a logical conclusion is that the security is fairly valued   If the security is selling for     the security would be considered overvalued  If the  security is selling for    the security would be considered undervalued  Basically by  estimating value the analyst is assuming that the market price is not necessarily the  best estimate of intrinsic value  If the estimated value exceeds the market price the  analyst infers the security is undervalued  If the estimated value equals the market  price the analyst infers the security is fairly valued  If the estimated value is less than  the market price the analyst infers the security is overvalued  In practice the conclusion is not so straightforward  Analysts must cope with  uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the correct value of inputs   An  analyst s final conclusion depends not only on the comparison of the estimated value  and the market price but also on the analyst s confidence in the estimated value  i e   in the model selected and the inputs used in it   One can envision a spectrum running  from relatively high confidence in the valuation model and the inputs to relatively  low confidence in the valuation model and or the inputs   When confidence is rela  tively low the analyst might demand a substantial divergence between his or her own  value estimate and the market price before acting on an apparent mispricing   For  instance if the estimate of intrinsic value is     and the market price is        the  analyst might reasonably conclude that the security is fairly valued and that the      of   percent market price difference from the estimated value is within the analyst s  confidence interval  Confidence in the convergence of the market price to the intrinsic value over the  investment time horizon relevant to the objectives of the portfolio must also be taken  into account before an analyst acts on an apparent mispricing or makes a buy sell  or hold recommendation  The ability to benefit from identifying a mispriced security  depends on the market price converging to the estimated intrinsic value  In seeking to identify mispricing and attractive investments  analysts are treating  market prices with skepticism but they are also treating market prices with respect  For  example an analyst who finds that many securities examined appear to be overvalued  will typically recheck models and inputs before acting on a conclusion of overvalu  ation  Analysts also often recognize and factor into recommendations that different  market segments such as securities closely followed by analysts versus securities  relatively neglected by analysts may differ in how common or persistent mispricing  is   Mispricing may be more likely in securities neglected by analysts

3,257,  An analyst finds that nearly all companies in a market segment have com  mon shares which are trading at market prices above the analyst s estimate  of the shares  values   This market segment is widely followed by analysts    Which of the following statements describes the analyst s most appropri  ate first action  A  Issue a sell recommendation for each share issue  B  Issue a buy recommendation for each share issue  C Reexamine the models and inputs used for the valuations     An analyst  using a number of models and a range of inputs  estimates a  security  s value to be between      and       The security is trading at        The security appears to be  A overvalued  B undervalued  C  fairly valued 
4,257,Solution to   
5,257,B is correct   The estimated intrinsic value for each security is greater than the  market price  The securities all appear to be undervalued in the market   Note  however that the analyst may wish to reexamine the model and inputs to check  that the conclusion is valid 
6,257,Solution to   
7,257,C is correct  It seems improbable that all the share issues analyzed are overvalued  as indicated by market prices in excess of estimated value particularly because  the market segment is widely followed by analysts   Thus  the analyst will not  issue a sell recommendation for each issue  The analyst will most appropriately  reexamine the models and inputs prior to issuing any recommendations   A  buy recommendation is not an appropriate response to an overvalued security

10,257,Analysts often use a variety of models and inputs to achieve greater confidence  in their estimates of intrinsic value  The use of more than one model and a range of  inputs also helps the analyst understand the sensitivity of value estimates to different  models and inputs

12,257,MAJOR CATEGORIES OF EQUITY VALUATION MODELS
13,257,Three major categories of equity valuation models are as follows  
14,257,   Present value models  synonym  discounted cash flow models   These mod 
15,257,els estimate the intrinsic value of a security as the present value of the future  benefits expected to be received from the security  In present value models   benefits are often defined in terms of cash expected to be distributed to share  holders  dividend discount models  or in terms of cash flows available to  be distributed to shareholders after meeting capital expenditure and working  capital needs  free   cash  flow  to  equity models   Many models fall within this

3,258,category ranging from the relatively simple to the very complex   In Section    we discuss in detail two of the simpler models  the Gordon  constant  growth  model and the two  stage dividend discount models  
4,258,   Multiplier models  synonym  market multiple models   These models are
5,258,based chiefly on share price multiples or enterprise value multiples   The former  model estimates intrinsic value of a common share from a price multiple for  some fundamental variable such as revenues  earnings  cash flows  or book  value  Examples of the multiples include price to earnings  P E  share price  divided by earnings per share  and price to sales  P S share price divided by  sales per share   The fundamental variable may be stated on a forward basis   e g   forecasted EPS for the next year  or a trailing basis  e g   EPS for the past  year  as long as the usage is consistent across companies being examined  Price  multiples are also used to compare relative values   The use of the ratio of share  price to EPS that is  the P E multiple to judge relative value is an example of  this approach to equity valuation  Enterprise value  EV   multiples have the form  Enterprise value   Value of a  fundamental variable   Two possible choices for the denominator are earnings  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  and total rev  enue  Enterprise value the numerator is a measure of a company  s total mar  ket value from which cash and short  term investments have been subtracted   because an acquirer could use those assets to pay for acquiring the company    An estimate of common share value can be calculated indirectly from the EV  multiple  the value of liabilities and preferred shares can be subtracted from the  EV to arrive at the value of common equity     Asset  based valuation models  These models estimate intrinsic value of a  common share from the estimated value of the assets of a corporation minus  the estimated value of its liabilities and preferred shares   The estimated mar  ket value of the assets is often determined by making adjustments to the book  value  synonym  carrying value  of assets and liabilities   The theory underlying  the asset  based approach is that the value of a business is equal to the sum of  the value of the business s assets   As already mentioned many analysts use more than one type of model to esti  mate value  Analysts recognize that each model is a simplification of the real world  and that there are uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the inputs to  the models   The choice of model s  will depend on the availability of information to  input into the model s  and the analyst s confidence in the information and in the  appropriateness of the model s

8,259,As you begin the study of specific equity valuation models in the next section you  must bear in mind that any model of value is  by necessity a simplification of the real  world  Never forget this simple fact  You may encounter models much more complicated  than the ones discussed here but even those models will be simplifications of reality 
9,259, 
10,259,PRESENT VALUE MODELS  THE DIVIDEND DISCOUNT  MODEL
11,259,Present value models follow a fundamental tenet of economics which states that  individuals defer consumption that is  they invest for the future benefits expected   Individuals and companies make an investment because they expect thereby to earn a  rate of return over the investment period  Logically the value of an investment should  be equal to the present value of the expected future benefits   For common shares   an analyst can equate benefits to the cash flows to be generated by the investment    The simplest present value model of equity valuation is the dividend discount model   DDM  which specifies cash flows from a common stock investment to be dividends   The next section describes aspects of dividends that users of dividend discount  models should understand 
12,259,    Dividends  Background for the Dividend Discount Model
13,259,Generally there are two sources of return from investing in equities       cash divi  dends received by an investor over his or her holding period and     the change in  the market price of equities over that holding period  A dividend is a distribution paid to shareholders based on the number of shares  owned and a cash dividend is a cash distribution made to a company  s shareholders    Cash dividends are typically paid out regularly at known intervals   such dividends are  known as regular cash dividends   By contrast  an extra dividend or special dividend  is a dividend paid by a company that does not pay dividends on a regular schedule or a
1,260,Present Value Models  The Dividend Discount Model
2,260,   
3,260,dividend that supplements regular cash dividends with an extra payment   Companies  in cyclical industries and companies undergoing corporate and or financial restruc  turing are among those observed to use extra dividends    The payment of dividends is not a legal obligation  dividends must be declared   i e  authorized  by a company  s board of directors   in some jurisdictions  they must  also be approved by shareholders   Regular cash dividends are customarily declared  and paid out quarterly in the United States and Canada  semiannually in Europe and  Japan  and annually in some other countries  including China   Dividend discount models address discounting expected cash dividends   A stock  dividend  also known as a bonus issue of shares  is a type of dividend in which a  company distributes additional shares of its common stock  typically        of the  shares then outstanding  to shareholders instead of cash  A stock dividend divides the   pie   the market value of shareholders  equity  into smaller pieces without affecting  the value of the pie or any shareholder  s proportional ownership in the company  Thus   stock dividends are not relevant for valuation  Stock splits and reverse stock splits are  similar to stock dividends in that they have no economic effect on the company or  shareholders   A stock split involves an increase in the number of shares outstanding  with a consequent decrease in share price  An example of a stock split is a two  for   one stock split in which each shareholder is issued an additional share for each share  currently owned  A reverse stock split involves a reduction in the number of shares  outstanding with a corresponding increase in share price  In a one  for  two reverse  stock split  each shareholder would receive one new share for every two old shares  held thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding by half  In contrast to stock dividends and stock splits  share repurchases are an alternative  to cash dividend payments   A share repurchase  or buyback  is a transaction in which  a company uses cash to buy back its own shares   Shares that have been repurchased  are not considered for dividends  voting  or computing earnings per share  A share  repurchase is viewed as equivalent to the payment of cash dividends of equal value  in terms of the effect on shareholders  wealth all other things being equal  Company  managements have expressed several key reasons for engaging in share repurchases  namely     signaling a belief that their shares are undervalued  or more generally to  support share prices      flexibility in the amount and timing of distributing cash to  shareholders      tax efficiency in markets where tax rates on dividends exceed tax  rates on capital gains  and     the ability to absorb increases in outstanding shares  because of the exercise of employee stock options   The payout of regular cash dividends to common shareholders follows a fairly  standard chronology that is set in motion once the company  s board of directors votes  to pay the dividend  First is the declaration date the day that the company issues  a statement declaring a specific dividend  Next comes the ex  dividend date  or ex   date  the first date that a share trades without  i e   ex   the dividend  This is followed  closely  one or two business days later  by the holder  of  record date  also called  the owner  of  record date shareholder  of  record date record date date of record or  date of book closure  the date that a shareholder listed on the company  s books will  be deemed to have ownership of the shares for purposes of receiving the upcoming  dividend  the amount of time between the ex  date and the holder  of  record date is  linked to the trade settlement cycle in force  The final milestone is the payment date   or payable date  which is the day that the company actually mails out  or electron  ically transfers  a dividend payment to shareholders  
4,260,  Another type of dividend is a liquidating dividend which is a return of capital rather than a distribution  from earnings or retained earnings   Liquidating dividends are used when a company goes out of business  and distributes its net assets  sells a portion of its business for cash and distributes the sale s proceeds  or  pays a dividend that exceeds its accumulated retained earnings

30,263,Extending the holding period into the indefinite future we can say that a stock s  estimated value is the present value of all expected future dividends as shown in  Equation    Consideration of an indefinite future is valid because businesses established as  corporations are generally set up to operate indefinitely  This general form of the DDM  applies even in the case in which the investor has a finite investment horizon  For that  investor stock value today depends directly on the dividends the investor expects to  receive before the stock is sold and depends indirectly on the expected dividends for  periods subsequent to that sale because those expected future dividends determine  the expected selling price  Thus  the general expression given by Equation    holds  irrespective of the investor  s holding period  In practice many analysts prefer to use a free  cash  flow  to  equity  FCFE  valuation  model  These analysts assume that dividend  paying capacity should be reflected in the  cash flow estimates rather than expected dividends  FCFE is a measure of dividend   paying capacity  Analysts may also use FCFE valuation models for a non  dividend   paying stock   To use a DDM the analyst needs to predict the timing and amount of  the first dividend and all the dividends or dividend growth thereafter  Making these  predictions for non  dividend  paying stock accurately is typically difficult  so in such  cases  analysts often resort to FCFE models   The calculation of FCFE starts with the calculation of cash flow from operations   CFO   CFO is simply defined as net income plus non  cash expenses minus invest  ment in working capital  FCFE is a measure of cash flow generated in a period that  is available for distribution to common shareholders   What does  available for dis  tribution  mean  The entire CFO is not available for distribution  the portion of the  CFO needed for fixed capital investment  FCInv  during the period to maintain the  value of the company as a going concern is not viewed as available for distribution to  common shareholders   Net amounts borrowed  borrowings minus repayments  are  considered to be available for distribution to common shareholders   Thus  FCFE can  be expressed as FCFE   CFO   FCInv   Net borrowing   The information needed to calculate historical FCFE is available from a company  s  statement of cash flows and financial disclosures   Frequently under the assumption  that management is acting in the interest of maintaining the value of the company as

3,266,Preferred stock issues are frequently callable  redeemable  by the issuer at some  point prior to maturity often at par value or at prices in excess of par value that decline  to par value as the maturity date approaches   Such call options tend to reduce the  value of a preferred issue to an investor because the option to redeem will be exercised  by the issuer when it is in the issuer s favor and ignored when it is not   For example  if an issuer can redeem shares at par value that would otherwise trade  on the basis  of dividends  maturity and required rate of return  above par value the issuer has  motivation to redeem the shares   Preferred stock issues can also include a retraction option that enables the holder of  the preferred stock to sell the shares back to the issuer prior to maturity on prespecified  terms   Essentially the holder of the shares has a put option  Such put options tend to  increase the value of a preferred issue to an investor because the option to retract will  be exercised by the investor when it is in the investor s favor and ignored when it is  not   Although the precise valuation of issues with such embedded options is beyond  the scope of this reading  Example   includes a case in which Equation   can be used  to approximate the value of a callable retractable preferred share

11,266,The intrinsic value would be lower if the issue were callable  The option to  redeem or call the issue is valuable to the issuer because the call will be exercised  when doing so is in the issuer  s interest   The intrinsic value of the shares to the  investor will typically be lower if the issue is callable  In this case because the  intrinsic value without the call is much less than the par value the issuer would  be unlikely to redeem the issue if it were callable  thus  callability would reduce  intrinsic value but only slightly

3,267,Case    Retractable Term Preferred Shares
4,267,Retractable term preferred shares are a type of preferred share that has been  issued by Canadian companies   This type of issue specifies a  retraction date   when the preferred shareholders have the option to sell back their shares to the  issuer at par value  i e  the shares are  retractable  or  putable  at that date     At predetermined dates prior to the retraction date the issuer has the option  to redeem the preferred issue at predetermined prices  which are always at or  above par value   An example of a retractable term preferred share currently outstanding is  YPG  Yellow Pages  Holdings  series     percent first preferreds   YPG Holdings  is Canada s leading local commercial search provider and largest telephone  directory publisher  The issue is in Canadian dollars   The shares have a      par value and pay a quarterly dividend of                percent            As  of    December       shares were priced at        and carried ratings from  Dominion Bond Rating Service  DBRS  and Standard   Poor  s of Pfd   H and  P  respectively  Thus  the shares are viewed by DBRS as having  adequate   credit quality qualified by  H  which means relatively high quality within that  group  The shares are redeemable at the option of YPG Holdings in June      at         with redemption prices eventually declining to par value at later dates    The retraction date is    June       or eight and half years     quarters  from  the date     December       the shares were being valued  Similarly rated pre  ferred issues had an estimated nominal required rate of return of      percent         percent per quarter   Because the issue s market price is so far below the  prices at which YPG could redeem or call the issue redemption is considered to  be unlikely and the redemption option is assumed here to have minimal value  for an investor  A Assume that the issue will be retracted in June       the holders of the  shares will put the shares to the company in June       Based on the  information given estimate the intrinsic value of a share

36,267,    The Gordon Growth Model
37,267,A rather obvious problem when one is trying to implement Equation   for common  equity is that it requires the analyst to estimate an infinite series of expected dividends    To simplify this process  analysts frequently make assumptions about how dividends  will grow or change over time  The Gordon  constant  growth model  Gordon        is a simple and well  recognized DDM  The model assumes dividends grow indefinitely  at a constant rate 
38,267,   Retraction  refers to this option which is a put option  The terminology is not completely settled   The type of share being called  retractable term preferred  is also known as  hard retractable preferred   with  hard  referring to payment in cash rather than common shares at the retraction date  See the       ScotiaMcLeod report http   www ritceyteam com pdf guide to preferred shares  pdf

3,268,Because of its assumption of a constant growth rate the Gordon growth model is  particularly appropriate for valuing the equity of dividend  paying companies that are  relatively insensitive to the business cycle and in a mature growth phase  Examples  might include an electric utility serving a slowly growing area or a producer of a staple  food product  e g   bread   A history of increasing the dividend at a stable growth rate  is another practical criterion if the analyst believes that pattern will hold in the future  With a constant growth assumption Equation    can be written as Equation     where g is the constant growth rate

45,270,Note that no value is shown when the growth rate exceeds the required rate  of return  The Gordon growth model assumes that the growth rate cannot be  greater than the required rate of return

3,271,An analyst might be dissatisfied with these assumptions for many reasons   The  equities being examined might not currently pay a dividend  The Gordon assumptions  might be too simplistic to reflect the characteristics of the companies being evaluated   Some alternatives to using the Gordon model are as follows      Use a more robust DDM that allows for varying patterns of growth     Use a cash flow measure other than dividends for valuation purposes      Use some other approach  such as a multiplier method  to valuation  Applying a DDM is difficult if the company being analyzed is not currently paying a  dividend  A company may not be paying a dividend if    the investment opportunities  the company has are all so attractive that the retention and reinvestment of funds is  preferable from a return perspective to the distribution of a dividend to shareholders  or    the company is in such shaky financial condition that it cannot afford to pay a  dividend  An analyst might still use a DDM to value such companies by assuming that  dividends will begin at some future point in time  The analyst might further assume  that constant growth occurs after that date and use the Gordon growth model for  valuation  Extrapolating from no current dividend however generally yields highly  uncertain forecasts   Analysts typically choose to use one or more of the alternatives  instead of or as a supplement to the Gordon growth model

23,272,The next section addresses the application of the DDM with more flexible assump  tions as to the dividend growth rate 
24,272,    Multistage Dividend Discount Models
25,272,Multistage growth models are often used to model rapidly growing companies   The  two  stage DDM assumes that at some point the company will begin to pay dividends  that grow at a constant rate but prior to that time the company will pay dividends  that are growing at a higher rate than can be sustained in the long run  That is  the  company is assumed to experience an initial finite period of high growth perhaps  prior to the entry of competitors  followed by an infinite period of sustainable growth   The two  stage DDM thus makes use of two growth rates   a high growth rate for an  initial finite period followed by a lower sustainable growth rate into perpetuity  The  Gordon growth model is used to estimate a terminal value at time n that reflects the  present value at time n of the dividends received during the sustainable growth period  Equation    will be used here as the starting point for a two  stage valuation model   The two  stage valuation model is similar to Example   except that instead of assuming  zero dividends for the initial period the analyst assumes that dividends will exhibit a  high rate of growth during the initial period  Equation     values the dividends over  the short  term period of high growth and the terminal value at the end of the period  of high growth  The short  term growth rate gS lasts for n years   The intrinsic value  per share in year n Vn represents the year n value of the dividends received during  the sustainable growth period or the terminal value at time n  Vn can be estimated by  using the Gordon growth model as shown in Equation    where gL is the long  term  or sustainable growth rate  The dividend in year n     Dn   can be determined by  using Equation

39,273,The DDM can be extended to as many stages as deemed appropriate  For most  publicly traded companies  that is  companies beyond the start  up stage  practitioners  assume growth will ultimately fall into three stages      growth    transition and     maturity  This assumption supports the use of a three  stage DDM which makes use  of three growth rates   a high growth rate for an initial finite period followed by a  lower growth rate for a finite second period followed by a lower sustainable growth  rate into perpetuity  One can make the case that a three  stage DDM would be most appropriate for a  fairly young company one that is just entering the growth phase  The two  stage DDM  would be appropriate to estimate the value of an older company that has already  moved through its growth phase and is currently in the transition phase  a period  with a higher growth rate than the sustainable growth rate  prior to moving to the  maturity phase  the period with a lower sustainable growth rate   However the choice of a two  stage DDM need not rely solely on the age of a  company  Long  established companies sometimes manage to restart above  average  growth through for example innovation expansion to new markets  or acquisitions    Or a company  s long  run growth rate may be interrupted by a period of subnormal  performance  If growth is expected to moderate  in the first case  or improve  in the  second case  toward some long  term growth rate a two  stage DDM may be appro  priate  Thus  we chose a two  stage DDM to value Brown  Forman in Example    
40,273,Two  Stage Dividend Discount Model  Brown  Forman
41,273,Brown  Forman Corporation is a diversified producer of wines and spirits   It was  founded in      by George Garvin Brown in Louisville Kentucky USA   His  original brand Old Forester Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky was America s  first bottled bourbon  Brown  Forman one of the largest American  owned spirits  and wine companies and among the top    largest global spirits companies  sells  its brands in more than     countries and has offices in cities across the globe  In  all Brown  Forman has more than    brands in its portfolio of wines and spirits   The    January      Value Line report on Brown  Forman appears in Exhibit     Brown  Forman has increased its dividends every year except      when the  dividend remained at US      as it was in       On the left side of the report   in the section titled  Annual Rates   dividend growth is shown as      percent  for the past    years      percent for the past   years  and estimated    percent  for           to            After a period of growth through acquisition  and merger the pattern suggests that Brown  Forman may be transitioning to  a mature growth phase

3,274,The two  stage DDM is arguably a good choice for valuing Brown Forman  because the company appears to be transitioning from a high  growth phase   note the     percent dividend growth for the past   years  to a lower  growth  phase  note the forecast of   percent dividend growth to             The analyst  discussion refers to the company facing  short  term obstacles  and states that  the company  s  capital appreciation potential for the    to    year time frame is  well below average   The CAPM can be used to estimate the required return r for Brown  Forman   The Value Line report  in the upper left corner  estimates beta to be       Using  the yield of about     percent on     year US Treasury notes as a proxy for the  risk  free rate and assuming an equity risk premium of     percent  we find the  estimate for r would be     percent                      To estimate the intrinsic value at the end of      we use the      dividend  of US      from the Value Line report   The dividend is assumed to grow at a  rate of     percent for two years and then     percent thereafter  The growth rate  assumption for the first stage is consistent with the Value Line forecast for       to      growth  The assumption of a     percent perpetual growth rate produces  a five  year growth rate assumption near   percent   which is consistent with the  Value Line forecast of   percent growth to            Thus   D       US                   US        D       US                    US          D       US                              US

5,276,The term price multiple refers to a ratio that compares the share price with some  sort of monetary flow or value to allow evaluation of the relative worth of a company  s  stock   Some practitioners use price ratios as a screening mechanism  If the ratio falls  below a specified value the shares are identified as candidates for purchase and if the  ratio exceeds a specified value the shares are identified as candidates for sale  Many  practitioners use ratios when examining a group or sector of stocks and consider the  shares for which the ratio is relatively low to be attractively valued securities   Price multiples that are used by security analysts include the following     Price  to  earnings ratio  P E   This measure is the ratio of the stock price to  earnings per share  P E is arguably the price multiple most frequently cited by  the media and used by analysts and investors  Block        The seminal works  of McWilliams        Miller and Widmann        Nicholson        Dreman         and Basu        presented evidence of a return advantage to low  P E  stocks      Price  to  book ratio  P B   The ratio of the stock price to book value per share   Considerable evidence suggests that P B multiples are inversely related to future  rates of return  Fama and French           Price  to  sales ratio  P S   This measure is the ratio of stock price to sales per  share  O Shaughnessy        provided evidence that a low P S multiple is the  most useful multiple for predicting future returns      Price  to  cash  flow ratio  P CF   This measure is the ratio of stock price to some  per  share measure of cash flow  The measures of cash flow include free cash  flow  FCF  and operating cash flow  OCF   A common criticism of all of these multiples is that they do not consider the future   This criticism is true if the multiple is calculated from trailing or current values of the  divisor  Practitioners seek to counter this criticism by a variety of techniques  including  forecasting fundamental values  the divisors  one or more years into the future  The  resulting forward  leading or prospective  price multiples may differ markedly from  the trailing price multiples   In the absence of an explicit forecast of fundamental val  ues  the analyst is making an implicit forecast of the future when implementing such  models   The choice of price multiple trailing or forward should be used consistently  for companies being compared  Besides the traditional price multiples used in valuation just presented analysts  need to know how to calculate and interpret other ratios   Such ratios include those  used to analyze business performance and financial condition based on data reported  in financial statements   In addition many industries have specialized measures of  business performance that analysts covering those industries should be familiar with   In analyzing cable television companies  for example the ratio of total market value of  the company to the total number of subscribers is commonly used  Another common  measure is revenue per subscriber  In the oil industry a commonly cited ratio is proved  reserves per common share  Industry  specific or sector  specific ratios such as these  can be used to understand the key business variables in an industry or sector as well  as to highlight attractively valued securities

3,277,    Relationships among Price Multiples Present Value  Models and Fundamentals
4,277,Price multiples are frequently used independently of present value models   One price  multiple valuation approach the method of comparables  does not involve cash flow  forecasts or discounting to present value  A price multiple is often related to funda  mentals through a discounted cash flow model however such as the Gordon growth  model  Understanding such connections can deepen the analyst s appreciation of the  factors that affect the value of a multiple and often can help explain reasons for differ  ences in multiples that do not involve mispricing   The expressions that are developed  can be interpreted as the justified value of a multiple that is  the value justified by   based on  fundamentals or a set of cash flow predictions   These expressions are an  alternative way of presenting intrinsic  value estimates   As an example using the Gordon growth model identified previously in Equation    and assuming that price equals intrinsic value  P    V   we can restate Equation     as follows

14,277,To arrive at the model for the justified forward P E given in Equation    we divide  both sides of Equation     by a forecast for next year  s earnings  E   In Equation     the dividend payout ratio p is the ratio of dividends to earnings

28,277,Equation     indicates that the P E is inversely related to the required rate of  return and positively related to the growth rate  that is  as the required rate of return  increases  the P E declines  and as the growth rate increases  the P E increases   The  P E and the payout ratio appear to be positively related  This relationship may not  be true however because a higher payout ratio may imply a slower growth rate as a  result of the company retaining a lower proportion of earnings for reinvestment   This  phenomenon is referred to as the dividend displacement of earnings

3,278,Solution 
4,278,The data support a higher P E for Petrobras because its payout ratio and five  year  EPS growth rate exceed those of the industry  Equation     implies a positive  relationship between the payout ratio and the P E multiple  A higher payout  ratio supports a higher P E   Furthermore to the extent that higher EPS growth  implies a high growth rate in dividends  the high EPS growth rate supports a  high P E   Although the Petrobras quarterly EPS have declined relative to EPS  of a year ago the decline is less than that of the industry

25,279,Justified forward P E estimates can be sensitive to small changes in assumptions    Therefore analysts can benefit from carrying out a sensitivity analysis  as shown in  Exhibit   which is based on Example     Exhibit   shows how the justified forward  P E varies with changes in the estimates for the dividend payout ratio  columns  and  return on equity  The dividend growth rate  rows  changes because of changes in the  retention rate      Payout rate  and ROE   Recall g   ROE times retention rate

16,280,The method of comparables is the most widely used approach for analysts reporting  valuation judgments on the basis of price multiples   This method essentially com  pares relative values estimated using multiples or the relative values of multiples   The  economic rationale underlying the method of comparables is the law of one price   Identical assets should sell for the same price  The methodology involves using a price  multiple to evaluate whether an asset is fairly valued undervalued or overvalued in  relation to a benchmark value of the multiple  Choices for the benchmark multiple  include the multiple of a closely matched individual stock or the average or median  value of the multiple for the stock s industry  Some analysts perform trend or time   series analyses and use past or average values of a price multiple as a benchmark   Identifying individual companies or even an industry as the  comparable  may  present a challenge  Many large corporations operate in several lines of business   so the scale and scope of their operations can vary significantly  When identifying  comparables  sometimes referred to as  comps   the analyst should be careful to  identify companies that are most similar according to a number of dimensions   These  dimensions include  but are not limited to  overall size product lines  and growth  rate  The type of analysis shown in Section     relating multiples to fundamentals  is a productive way to identify the fundamental variables that should be taken into  account in identifying comparables

19,280,As noted previously P E is a price multiple frequently used by analysts   Using  P E in the method of comparables can be problematic however as a result of  business cycle effects on EPS  An alternative valuation tool that is useful during  periods of economic slowdown or extraordinary growth is the P S multiple   Although sales will decline during a recession and increase during a period of  economic growth the change in sales will be less than the change in earnings  in percentage terms because earnings are heavily influenced by fixed operating  and financing costs  operating and financial leverage   The following data provide the P S for most of the major automobile man  ufacturers as at December

13,281,Incorporated in the Netherlands  Airbus is active in the aerospace and defense  industry  It is a dominant aerospace company in Europe  Its largest business   Airbus Commercial Aircraft  is a manufacturing company with bases in several  European countries and accounts for the majority of Airbus SE profits   Airbus  and its primary competitor Boeing  control most of the global commercial  airplane industry  Comparisons are frequently made between Airbus and Boeing   As noted in  Exhibit    the companies are broadly similar in size as measured by total rev  enues   Converting total forecast revenues from euros to US dollars using the  average exchange rate for      of US        results in a value of        billion  for Airbus s total revenues   Thus  total revenues for Boeing are expected to be  about a fifth higher than those for Boeing   The companies do differ however in several important areas   Airbus derives  a greater share of its revenue from commercial aircraft production than does  Boeing  and the order backlog for Airbus is much higher than that for Boeing    Converting the Airbus order backlog from euros to US dollars using the quarter   end rate for September      of           results in a value of       billion for  Airbus s order backlog   Thus  the order backlog for Airbus is more than twice  as high as the backlog for Boeing

15,282,What data shown in Exhibit   support a higher P E for Boeing than for Airbus 
16,282,Solution 
17,282,Recall from Equation    and the discussion that followed it that P E is directly  related to the payout ratio and the dividend growth rate  The P E is inversely  related to the required rate of return  The only data presented in Exhibit   that  support a higher P E for Boeing is the company  s higher dividend payout ratio   expected at    percent versus    percent for Airbus   The following implicitly supports a higher P E for Airbus   Airbus has higher  revenue growth  as reported for      and expected for       and a higher backlog  of orders  suggesting that it may have a higher future growth rate

48,284,Time  series analysis of all price multiples in Exhibit   suggests that both companies  are currently attractively valued  For example the      price  to  revenue ratio  P R   of     for Telef nica is below the           average for this ratio of approximately       The      P CF of     for Deutsche Telekom is below the           average for  this ratio of approximately      A comparative analysis produces somewhat mixed results   The      values for  Deutsche Telekom for the P R  P CF P B multiples are lower than those for Telef nica    This result suggests that Deutsche Telekom is attractively valued when compared with  Telef nica   The      P E for Telef nica  however is much lower than for Deutsche  Telekom  An analyst investigating these contradictory results would look for information not  reported in Exhibit    For example the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  EBITDA  for Telef nica was        billion in       The EBITDA  value for Deutsche Telekom was        billion in       The      price  to  EBITDA  ratio for Telef nica is                        or                            whereas  the      price  to  EBITDA ratio for Deutsche Telekom is      Thus  the higher P E for  Deutsche Telekom may be explained by higher depreciation charges  higher interest  costs  and or a greater tax burden  In summary the major advantage of using price multiples is that they allow for  relative comparisons  both cross  sectional  versus the market or another comparable   and in time series   The approach can be especially beneficial for analysts who are  assigned to a particular industry or sector and need to identify the expected best per  forming stocks within that sector  Price multiples are popular with investors because  the multiples can be calculated easily and many multiples are readily available from  financial websites and newspapers   Caution is necessary  A stock may be relatively undervalued when compared with  its benchmarks but overvalued when compared with an estimate of intrinsic value  as determined by one of the discounted cash flow methodologies   Furthermore  differences in reporting rules among different markets and in chosen accounting  methods can result in revenues  earnings  book values  and cash flows that are not  easily comparable  These differences can in turn result in multiples that are not easily  comparable  Finally the multiples for cyclical companies may be highly influenced by  current economic conditions

3,285,    Enterprise Value
4,285,An alternative to estimating the value of equity is to estimate the value of the enter  prise  Enterprise value is most frequently determined as market capitalization plus  market value of preferred stock plus market value of debt minus cash and investments   cash equivalents and short  term investments   Enterprise value is often viewed as  the cost of a takeover   In the event of a buyout  the acquiring company assumes the  acquired company  s debt but also receives its cash  Enterprise value is most useful  when comparing companies with significant differences in capital structure  Enterprise value  EV   multiples are widely used in Europe with EV EBITDA  arguably the most common  EBITDA is a proxy for operating cash flow because it  excludes depreciation and amortization  EBITDA may include other non  cash expenses   however and non  cash revenues   EBITDA can be viewed as a source of funds to pay  interest  dividends  and taxes   Because EBITDA is calculated prior to payment to  any of the company  s financial stakeholders  using it to estimate enterprise value is  logically appropriate  Using enterprise value instead of market capitalization to determine a multiple can  be useful to analysts   Even where the P E is problematic because of negative earnings   the EV EBITDA multiple can generally be computed because EBITDA is usually  positive  An alternative to using EBITDA in EV multiples is to use operating income  In practice analysts may have difficulty accurately assessing enterprise value if they  do not have access to market quotations for the company  s debt  When current market  quotations are not available bond values may be estimated from current quotations for  bonds with similar maturity sector and credit characteristics   Substituting the book  value of debt for the market value of debt provides only a rough estimate of the debt s  market value  This is because market interest rates change and investors  perception  of the issuer  s credit risk may have changed since the debt was issued

20,287,ASSET  BASED VALUATION
21,287,An asset  based valuation of a company uses estimates of the market or fair value of the  company  s assets and liabilities   Thus  asset  based valuations work well for companies  that do not have a high proportion of intangible or  off the books  assets and that do  have a high proportion of current assets and current liabilities   The analyst may be able  to value these companies  assets and liabilities in a reasonable fashion by starting with  balance sheet items   For most companies  however balance sheet values are different  from market  fair  values  and the market  fair  values can be difficult to determine 
1,288,Asset  Based Valuation
2,288,   
3,288,Asset  based valuation models are frequently used together with multiplier models  to value private companies   As public companies increase reporting or disclosure of  fair values  asset  based valuation may be increasingly used to supplement present  value and multiplier models of valuation  Important facts that the practitioner should  realize are as follows      Companies with assets that do not have easily determinable market  fair  val  ues such as those with significant property plant  and equipment are very  difficult to analyze using asset valuation methods      Asset and liability fair values can be very different from the values at which they  are carried on the balance sheet of a company     Some assets that are  intangible  are shown on the books of the company  Other  intangible assets  such as the value from synergies or the value of a good busi  ness reputation may not be shown on the books   Because asset  based valuation  may not consider some intangibles  it can give a  floor  value for a situation  involving a significant amount of intangibles   When a company has significant  intangibles  the analyst should prefer a forward  looking cash flow valuation     Asset values may be more difficult to estimate in a hyper  inflationary  environment   We begin by discussing asset  based valuation for hypothetical nonpublic companies  and then move on to a public company example  Analysts should consider the difficul  ties and rewards of using asset  based valuation for companies that are suited to this  measure  Owners of small privately held businesses are familiar with valuations arrived  at by valuing the assets of the company and then subtracting any relevant liabilities

5,288,An Asset  Based Valuation of a Family  Owned Laundry
6,288,A family owns a laundry and the real estate on which the laundry stands   The  real estate is collateral for an outstanding loan of          How can asset  based  valuation be used to value this business

8,288,The analyst should get at least two market appraisals for the real estate  building  and land  and estimate the cost to extinguish the         loan  This information  would provide estimated values for everything except the laundry as a going  concern  That is  the analyst has market values for the building and land and the  loan but needs to value the laundry business   The analyst can value the assets  of the laundry   the equipment and inventory  The equipment can be valued at  depreciated value inflation  adjusted depreciated value or replacement cost    Replacement cost in this case means the amount that would have to be spent  to buy equivalent used machines   This amount is the market value of the used  machines   The analyst will recognize that any intangible value of the laundry   prime location clever marketing  etc   is being excluded which will result in  an inaccurate asset  based valuation

4,289,An Asset  Based Valuation of a Restaurant
5,289,The business being valued is a restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch  The  owner proprietor wants to sell the business and retire  The restaurant space is  rented not owned  This particular restaurant is hugely popular because of the  proprietor  s cooking skills and secret recipes   How can the analyst value this  business 
6,289,Solution 
7,289,Because of the intangibles  setting a value on this business is challenging   A  multiple of income or revenue might be considered  But even those approaches  overlook the fact that the proprietor may not be selling his secret recipes and  furthermore does not intend to continue cooking   Some  or all  of the intangi  ble assets may vanish when the business is sold  Asset  based valuation for this  restaurant would begin with estimating the value of the restaurant equipment  and inventory and subtracting the value of any liabilities   This approach will  provide only a good baseline however for a minimum valuation 
8,289,For public companies  the assets will typically be so extensive that a piece  by  piece  analysis will be impossible and the transition from book value to market value is a  nontrivial task   The asset  based valuation approach is most applicable when the market  value of the corporate assets is readily determinable and the intangible assets  which  are typically difficult to value are a relatively small proportion of corporate assets    Asset  based valuation has also been applied to financial companies  natural resource  companies  and formerly going  concerns that are being liquidated  Even for other  types of companies  however asset  based valuation of tangible assets may provide a  baseline for a minimal valuation 
9,289,EXAMPLE   
10,289,An Asset  Based Valuation of an Airline
11,289,Consider the value of an airline company that has few routes  high labor and other  operating costs  has stopped paying dividends  and is losing millions of dollars  each year  Using most valuation approaches  the company will have a negative  value  Why might an asset  based valuation approach be appropriate for use by  one of the company  s competitors that is considering acquisition of this airline 
12,289,Solution 
13,289,The airline s routes  landing rights  leases of airport facilities  and ground equip  ment and airplanes may have substantial value to a competitor  An asset  based  approach to valuing this company would value the company  s assets separately and  aside from the money  losing business in which they are presently being utilized 
14,289,Analysts recognizing the uncertainties related to model appropriateness and the  inputs to the models frequently use more than one model or type of model in valuation  to increase their confidence in their estimates of intrinsic value  The choice of models  will depend on the availability of information to put into the models   Example      illustrates the use of three valuation methods

10,291,SUMMARY
11,291,The equity valuation models used to estimate intrinsic value present value models   multiplier models  and asset  based valuation are widely used and serve an import  ant purpose  The valuation models presented here are a foundation on which to base  analysis and research but must be applied wisely  Valuation is not simply a numerical  analysis   The choice of model and the derivation of inputs require skill and judgment   When valuing a company or group of companies  the analyst wants to choose a  valuation model that is appropriate for the information available to be used as inputs    The available data will in most instances  restrict the choice of model and influence the  way it is used  Complex models exist that may improve on the simple valuation models  described in this reading  but before using those models and assuming that complexity  increases accuracy the analyst would do well to consider the  law of parsimony    A

10,308,Judged by total market value fixed  income securities constitute the most prevalent  means of raising capital globally  A fixed  income security is an instrument that allows  governments  companies  and other types of issuers to borrow money from investors    Any borrowing of money is debt   The promised payments on fixed  income securities  are in general contractual  legal  obligations of the issuer to the investor  For com  panies  fixed  income securities contrast to common shares in not having ownership  rights   Payment of interest and repayment of principal  amount borrowed  are a prior  claim on the company  s earnings and assets compared with the claim of common  shareholders   Thus  a company  s fixed  income securities have in theory lower risk  than that company  s common shares

5,309,OVERVIEW OF A FIXED  INCOME SECURITY
6,309,A bond is a contractual agreement between the issuer and the bondholders   There  are three important elements that an investor needs to know about when investing  in a bond     The bond s features  including the issuer maturity par value coupon rate and  frequency and currency denomination  These features determine the bond s  scheduled cash flows and therefore are key determinants of the investor  s  expected and actual return     The legal regulatory and tax considerations that apply to the contractual agree  ment between the issuer and the bondholders      The contingency provisions that may affect the bond s scheduled cash flows    These contingency provisions are options   they give the issuer or the bondhold  ers certain rights affecting the bond s disposal or redemption 
7,309,  Note that the term  fixed income  is not to be understood literally   Some fixed  income securities have  interest payments that change over time  Some experts include preference shares as a type of fixed  income  security but none view them as a type of bond  Finally in some contexts  bonds refer to the longer  maturity  form of debt securities in contrast to money market securities

3,310,This section describes a bond s basic features and introduces yield measures   The  legal regulatory and tax considerations and contingency provisions are discussed in  Sections   and   respectively 
4,310,    Basic Features of a Bond
5,310,All bonds  whether they are  traditional  bonds or asset  backed securities  are char  acterized by the same basic features   Asset  backed securities  ABS  are created from  a process called securitization which involves moving assets from the owner of the  assets into a special legal entity  This special legal entity then uses the securitized assets  as guarantees to back  secure  a bond issue leading to the creation of ABS  Assets  that are typically used to create ABS include residential and commercial mortgage  loans  mortgages  automobile  auto  loans  student loans  bank loans  and credit card  debt among others   Many elements discussed in this reading apply to both traditional  bonds and ABS  Considerations specific to ABS are discussed in the introduction to  asset  backed securities reading  
6,310,      Issuer
7,310,Many entities issue bonds   private individuals  such as the musician David Bowie   national governments  such as Singapore or Italy   and companies  such as BP General  Electric or Tata Group  Bond issuers are classified into categories based on the similarities of these issuers  and their characteristics   Major types of issuers include the following     Supranational organizations  such as the World Bank or the European  Investment Bank      Sovereign  national  governments  such as the United States or Japan     Non  sovereign  local  governments  such as the state of Minnesota in the  United States  the region of Catalonia in Spain or the city of Edmonton in  Canada     Quasi  government entities  i e  agencies that are owned or sponsored by gov  ernments  such as postal services in many countries for example Correios in  Brazil La Poste in France or Pos in Indonesia     Companies  i e  corporate issuers   A distinction is often made between finan  cial issuers  e g   banks and insurance companies  and non  financial issuers   and    Special legal entities that securitize assets to create ABS that are then sold to  investors   Market participants often classify fixed  income markets by the type of issuer  which leads to the identification of three bond market sectors   the government and  government  related sector  i e  the first four types of issuers listed above  the cor  porate sector  the fifth type listed above  and the structured finance sector  the last  type listed above   Bondholders are exposed to credit risk that is  the risk of loss resulting from  the issuer failing to make full and timely payments of interest and or repayments of  principal  Credit risk is inherent to all debt investments   Bond markets are sometimes  classified into sectors based on the issuer  s creditworthiness as judged by credit rating  agencies   One major distinction is between investment  grade and non  investment  grade  bonds  also called high  yield or speculative bonds    Although a variety of considerations
8,310,  The three largest credit rating agencies are Moody  s Investors Service Standard   Poor  s  and Fitch  Ratings   Bonds rated Baa  or higher by Moody  s and BBB  or higher by Standard   Poor  s and Fitch are  considered investment grade 
1,311,   
2,311,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,311,enter into distinguishing the two sectors  the promised payments of investment  grade  bonds are perceived as less risky than those of non  investment  grade bonds because  of profitability and liquidity considerations   Some regulated financial intermediaries   such as banks and life insurance companies  may face explicit or implicit limitations of  holdings of non  investment  grade bonds   The investment policy statements of some  investors may also include constraints or limits on such holdings   From the issuer  s  perspective an investment  grade credit rating generally allows easier access to bond  markets and at lower interest rates than does a non  investment  grade credit rating   
4,311,      Maturity
5,311,The maturity date of a bond refers to the date when the issuer is obligated to redeem  the bond by paying the outstanding principal amount  The tenor is the time remaining  until the bond s maturity date  The tenor is an important consideration in the analysis  of a bond  It indicates the period over which the bondholder can expect to receive the  interest payments and the length of time until the principal is repaid in full  Maturities typically range from overnight to    years or longer  Fixed  income  securities with maturities at issuance  original maturity  of one year or less are known  as money market securities  Issuers of money market securities include governments  and companies   Commercial paper and certificates of deposit are examples of money  market securities   Fixed  income securities with original maturities that are longer than  one year are called capital market securities  Although very rare perpetual bonds  such as the consols issued by the sovereign government in the United Kingdom have  no stated maturity date 
6,311,      Par Value
7,311,The principal amount principal value or simply principal of a bond is the amount  that the issuer agrees to repay the bondholders on the maturity date  This amount is  also referred to as the par value or simply par face value nominal value redemption  value or maturity value  Bonds can have any par value  In practice bond prices are quoted as a percentage of their par value  For example  assume that a bond s par value is        A quote of    means that the bond price is                      When the bond is priced at      of par the bond is said to be  trading at par  If the bond s price is below      of par such as in the previous example  the bond is trading at a discount   Alternatively if the bond s price is above      of  par the bond is trading at a premium 
8,311,      Coupon Rate and Frequency
9,311,The coupon rate or nominal rate of a bond is the interest rate that the issuer agrees  to pay each year until the maturity date  The annual amount of interest payments  made is called the coupon  A bond s coupon is determined by multiplying its coupon  rate by its par value  For example a bond with a coupon rate of    and a par value of        will pay annual interest of                   Coupon payments may be made annually such as those for German government  bonds or Bunds   Many bonds  such as government and corporate bonds issued in the  United States or government gilts issued in the United Kingdom pay interest semi   annually  Some bonds make quarterly or monthly interest payments   The acronyms  QUIBS  quarterly interest bonds  and QUIDS  quarterly income debt securities   are used by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  respectively for bonds that make  quarterly interest payments   Many mortgage   backed securities  MBS  which are  ABS backed by residential or commercial mortgages  pay interest monthly to match
10,311,  Several other distinctions among credit ratings are made  They are discussed in depth in the reading on  fundamentals of credit analysis

3,312,the cash flows of the mortgages backing these MBS  If a bond has a coupon rate of     and a par value of       the periodic interest payments will be     if coupon  payments are made annually     if they are made semi  annually     if they are made  quarterly and    if they are made monthly  A plain vanilla bond or conventional bond pays a fixed rate of interest   In this  case the coupon payment does not change during the bond s life  However there are  bonds that pay a floating rate of interest   such bonds are called floating  rate notes   FRNs  or floaters  The coupon rate of a FRN includes two components   a reference  rate plus a spread  The spread also called margin is typically constant and expressed  in basis points  bps   A basis point is equal to        put another way there are      basis points in     The spread is set when the bond is issued based on the issuer  s  creditworthiness at issuance  The higher the issuer  s credit quality the lower the spread   The reference rate however resets periodically  Thus  as the reference rate changes   the coupon rate and coupon payment change accordingly  A widely used reference rate is the London interbank offered rate  Libor   Libor is  a collective name for a set of rates covering different currencies for different maturities  ranging from overnight to one year  Other reference rates include the Euro interbank  offered rate  Euribor  the Hong Kong interbank offered rate  Hibor  or the Singapore  interbank offered rate  Sibor  for issues denominated in euros  Hong Kong dollars   and Singapore dollars  respectively  Euribor Hibor and Sibor are like Libor sets of  rates for different maturities up to one year  For example assume that the coupon rate of a FRN that makes semi  annual  interest payments in June and December is expressed as the six  month Libor        bps   Suppose that in December   X  the six  month Libor is        The interest rate  that will apply to the payment due in June   X  will be                        Now  suppose that in June   X  the six  month Libor has decreased to        The interest  rate that will apply to the payment due in December    X  will decrease to                         More details about FRNs are provided in Section        All bonds  whether they pay a fixed or floating rate of interest  make periodic  coupon payments except for zero  coupon bonds  Such bonds do not pay interest   hence their name  Instead they are issued at a discount to par value and redeemed  at par   they are sometimes referred to as pure discount bonds  The interest earned  on a zero  coupon bond is implied and equal to the difference between the par value  and the purchase price  For example if the par value is       and the purchase price  is      the implied interest is

5,312,Bonds can be issued in any currency although a large number of bond issues are made  in either euros or US dollars   The currency of issue may affect a bond s attractiveness    If the currency is not liquid or freely traded or if the currency is very volatile relative  to major currencies  investments in that currency will not appeal to many investors    For this reason borrowers in developing countries often elect to issue bonds in a cur  rency other than their local currency such as in euros or US dollars  because doing so  makes it easier to place the bond with international investors   Issuers may also choose  to issue in a foreign currency if they are expecting cash flows in the foreign currency  because the interest payments and principal repayments can act as a natural hedge  reducing currency risk   If a bond is aimed solely at a country  s domestic investors  it  is more likely that the borrower will issue in the local currency  Dual  currency bonds make coupon payments in one currency and pay the par  value at maturity in another currency  For example assume that a Japanese company  needs to finance a long  term project in the United States that will take several years to  become profitable  The Japanese company could issue a yen US dollar dual  currency

5,314,Solution to   
6,314,C is correct   A sovereign bond is a bond issued by a national government  such  as the federal German government   A is incorrect because a bond issued by  the World Bank is a supranational bond  B is incorrect because a bond issued  by a local government  such as the city of New York  is a non  sovereign bond 
7,314,Solution to   
8,314,A is correct   Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the issuer failing to  make full and timely payments of interest and or repayments of principal  B is  incorrect because systemic risk is the risk of failure of the financial system  C is  incorrect because interest rate risk is the risk that a change in market interest  rate affects a bond s value  Systemic risk and interest rate risk are defined in  Sections     and       respectively 
9,314,Solution to   
10,314,A is correct   The primary difference between a money market security and a  capital market security is the maturity at issuance  Money market securities  mature in one year or less  whereas capital market securities mature in more  than one year 
11,314,Solution to   
12,314,C is correct   If a bond s price is higher than its par value the bond is trading at  a premium  A is incorrect because a bond is trading at par if its price is equal  to its par value  B is incorrect because a bond is trading at a discount if its price  is lower than its par value

3,315,Solution to   
4,315,A is correct   The annual coupon payment is                     The coupon  payments are made semi  annually so       paid twice a year 
5,315,Solution to   
6,315,A is correct  The interest rate that applies to the payment due in December   XX  is the six  month Libor at the end of June    XX plus    bps   Thus  it is                        
7,315,Solution to   
8,315,C is correct   A currency option bond gives bondholders the right to choose the  currency in which they want to receive each interest payment and principal  repayment   A is incorrect because a pure discount bond is issued at a discount  to par value and redeemed at par  B is incorrect because a dual  currency bond  makes coupon payments in one currency and pays the par value at maturity in  another currency 
9,315,    Yield Measures
10,315,There are several yield measures commonly used by market participants   The current  yield or running yield is equal to the bond s annual coupon divided by the bond s  price expressed as a percentage  For example if a bond has a coupon rate of    a  par value of       and a price of       the current yield is                       The current yield is a measure of income that is analogous to the dividend yield for  a common share  The most commonly referenced yield measure is known as the yield to maturity  also called the yield to redemption or redemption yield  The yield to maturity is  the internal rate of return on a bond s expected cash flows that is  the discount rate  that equates the present value of the bond s expected cash flows until maturity with  the bond s price  The yield to maturity can be considered an estimate of the bond s  expected return  it reflects the annual return that an investor will earn on a bond if  this investor purchases the bond today and holds it until maturity  There is an inverse  relationship between the bond s price and its yield to maturity all else being equal   That is  the higher the bond s yield to maturity the lower its price  Alternatively the  higher the bond s price the lower its yield to maturity  Thus  investors anticipating a  lower interest rate environment  in which investors demand a lower yield  to  maturity  on the bond  hope to earn a positive return from price appreciation  The reading on  understanding risk and return of fixed  income securities covers these fundamentals  and more

12,315,LEGAL REGULATORY AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS
13,315,As a bond is a contractual agreement between the issuer and the bondholders  it  is subject to legal considerations   Investors in fixed  income securities must also be  aware of the regulatory and tax considerations associated with the bonds in which  they invest or want to invest  
1,316,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,316,   
3,316,    Bond Indenture
4,316,The trust deed is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond the obligations  of the issuer and the rights of the bondholders   Market participants frequently call  this legal contract the bond indenture particularly in the United States and Canada    The indenture is written in the name of the issuer and references the features of the  bond issue such as the principal value for each bond the interest rate or coupon rate  to be paid the dates when the interest payments will be made the maturity date when  the bonds will be repaid and whether the bond issue comes with any contingency  provisions   The indenture also includes information regarding the funding sources  for the interest payments and principal repayments  and it specifies any collaterals   credit enhancements  or covenants   Collaterals are assets or financial guarantees  underlying the debt obligation above and beyond the issuer  s promise to pay  Credit  enhancements are provisions that may be used to reduce the credit risk of the bond  issue  Covenants are clauses that specify the rights of the bondholders and any actions  that the issuer is obligated to perform or prohibited from performing   Because it would be impractical for the issuer to enter into a direct agreement with  each of many bondholders  the indenture is usually held by a trustee  The trustee is  typically a financial institution with trust powers  such as the trust department of a  bank or a trust company  It is appointed by the issuer but it acts in a fiduciary capacity  with the bondholders   The trustee s role is to monitor that the issuer complies with  the obligations specified in the indenture and to take action on behalf of the bond  holders when necessary  The trustee s duties tend to be administrative and usually  include maintaining required documentation and records   holding beneficial title to  safeguarding  and appraising collateral  if any   invoicing the issuer for interest pay  ments and principal repayments   and holding funds until they are paid although the  actual mechanics of cash flow movements from the issuers to the trustee are typically  handled by the principal paying agent  In the event of default the discretionary powers  of the trustee increase considerably  The trustee is responsible for calling meetings  of bondholders to discuss the actions to take  The trustee can also bring legal action  against the issuer on behalf of the bondholders   For a plain vanilla bond the indenture is often a standard template that is updated  for the specific terms and conditions of a particular bond issue  For exotic bonds  the  document is tailored and can often be several hundred pages   When assessing the risk reward profile of a bond issue investors should be  informed by the content of the indenture  They should pay special attention to their  rights in the event of default  In addition to identifying the basic bond features described  earlier investors should carefully review the following areas      the legal identity of the bond issuer and its legal form     the source of repayment proceeds      the asset or collateral backing  if any      the credit enhancements  if any   and    the covenants  if any   We consider each of these areas in the following sections  
5,316,      Legal Identity of the Bond Issuer and its Legal Form
6,316,The legal obligation to make the contractual payments is assigned to the bond issuer   The issuer is identified in the indenture by its legal name  For a sovereign bond the  legal issuer is usually the office responsible for managing the national budget  such  as HM Treasury  Her Majesty  s Treasury  in the United Kingdom  The legal issuer
1,317,   
2,317,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,317,may be different from the body that administers the bond issue process   Using the  UK example the legal obligation to repay gilts lies with HM Treasury but the bonds  are issued by the UK Debt Management Office an executive agency of HM Treasury  For corporate bonds  the issuer is usually the corporate legal entity for example  Wal  Mart Stores Inc  Samsung Electronics Co  Ltd  or Volkswagen AG  However  bonds are sometimes issued by a subsidiary of a parent legal entity  In this case investors  should look at the credit quality of the subsidiary unless the indenture specifies that  the bond liabilities are guaranteed by the parent   When they are rated subsidiaries  often carry a credit rating that is lower than their parent  but this is not always the  case  For example in May      Santander UK plc was rated higher by Moody  s than  its Spanish parent  Banco Santander  Bonds are sometimes issued by a holding company which is the parent legal entity  for a group of companies  rather than by one of the operating companies in the group   This issue is important for investors to consider because a holding company may be  rated differently from its operating companies and investors may lack recourse to  assets held by those companies   If the bonds are issued by a holding company that has  fewer  or no  assets to call on should it default  investors face a higher level of credit  risk than if the bonds were issued by one of the operating companies in the group  For ABS the legal obligation to repay the bondholders often lies with the special  legal entity that was created by the financial institution in charge of the securitization  process   The financial institution is known as the sponsor or originator  The special  legal entity is most frequently referred to as a special purpose entity  SPE  in the United  States and a special purpose vehicle  SPV   in Europe and it is also sometimes called  a special purpose company  SPC   The legal form for the special legal entity may be  a limited partnership a limited liability company or a trust   Typically special legal  entities are thinly capitalized have no independent management or employees  and  have no purpose other than the transactions for which they were created  Through the securitization process  the sponsor transfers the assets to the special  legal entity to carry out some specific transaction or series of transactions   One of the  key reasons for forming a special legal entity is bankruptcy remoteness   The transfer of  assets by the sponsor is considered a legal sale  once the assets have been securitized  the sponsor no longer has ownership rights   Any party making claims following the  bankruptcy of the sponsor would be unable to recover the assets or their proceeds   As  a result  the special legal entity  s ability to pay interest and repay the principal should  remain intact even if the sponsor were to fail hence the reason why the special legal  entity is also called a bankruptcy  remote vehicle 
4,317,      Source of Repayment Proceeds
5,317,The indenture usually describes how the issuer intends to service the debt  make  interest payments  and repay the principal  Generally the source of repayment for  bonds issued by supranational organizations is either the repayment of previous  loans made by the organization or the paid  in capital from its members   National  governments may also act as guarantors for certain bond issues   If additional sources  of repayment are needed the supranational organization can typically call on its  members to provide funds   Sovereign bonds are backed by the  full faith and credit  of the national govern  ment and thus by that government s ability to raise tax revenues and print money   Sovereign bonds denominated in local currency are generally considered the safest of  all investments because governments have the power to raise taxes to make interest  payments and principal repayments   Thus  it is highly probable that interest and prin  cipal will be paid fully and on time  As a consequence the yields on sovereign bonds  are typically lower than those for otherwise similar bonds from other local issuers  
1,318,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,318,   
3,318,There are three major sources for repayment of non  sovereign government debt  issues  and bonds are usually classified according to these sources   The first source  is through the general taxing authority of the issuer  The second source is from the  cash flows of the project the bond issue is financing   The third source is from special  taxes or fees established specifically for the purpose of funding interest payments and  principal repayments   The source of payment for corporate bonds is the issuer  s ability to generate cash  flows  primarily through its operations   These cash flows depend on the issuer  s finan  cial strength and integrity  Because corporate bonds carry a higher level of credit risk  than otherwise similar sovereign and non  sovereign government bonds  they typically  offer a higher yield  In contrast to corporate bonds  the source of payment for ABS does not depend  on the claims  paying ability of an operating entity but on the cash flows generated  by one or more underlying financial assets  such as mortgages or auto loans   Thus   investors in ABS must pay special attention to the quality of the assets backing the ABS 
4,318,      Asset or Collateral Backing
5,318,Collateral backing is a way to alleviate credit risk   Investors should review where they  rank compared with other creditors in the event of default and analyze the quality of  the collateral backing the bond issue          Seniority Ranking Secured bonds are backed by assets or financial guaran  tees pledged to ensure debt repayment in the case of default  In contrast unsecured  bonds have no collateral  bondholders have only a general claim on the issuer  s assets  and cash flows   Thus  unsecured bonds are paid after secured bonds in the event of  default  By lowering credit risk  collateral backing increases the bond issue s credit  quality and decreases its yield  A bond s collateral backing might not specify an identifiable asset but instead may  be described as the  general plant and infrastructure  of the issuer  In such cases   investors rely on seniority ranking that is  the systematic way in which lenders are  repaid in case of bankruptcy or liquidation  What matters to investors is where they  rank compared with other creditors rather than whether there is an asset of sufficient  quality and value in place to cover their claims   Senior debt is debt that has a priority  claim over subordinated debt or junior debt  Financial institutions issue a large volume  of both senior unsecured and subordinated bonds globally   it is not uncommon to see  large as well as smaller banks issue such bonds   For example in      banks as diverse  as Royal Bank of Scotland in the United Kingdom and Prime Bank in Bangladesh  issued senior unsecured bonds to institutional investors   Debentures are a type of bond that can be secured or unsecured  In many juris  dictions  debentures are unsecured bonds  with no collateral backing assigned to the  bondholders   In contrast  bonds known as  debentures  in the United Kingdom and  in other Commonwealth countries  such as India  are usually backed by an asset or  pool of assets assigned as collateral support for the bond obligations and segregated  from the claims of other creditors   Thus  it is important for investors to review the  indenture to determine whether a debenture is secured or unsecured  If the debenture  is secured debenture holders rank above unsecured creditors of the company   they  have a specific asset or pool of assets that the trustee can call on to realize the debt  in the event of default           Types of Collateral Backing There is a wide range of bonds that are secured  by some form of collateral  Some companies issue collateral trust bonds and equipment  trust certificates   Collateral trust bonds are secured by securities such as common  shares other bonds or other financial assets  These securities are pledged by the issuer  and typically held by the trustee  Equipment trust certificates are bonds secured by
1,319,   
2,319,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,319,specific types of equipment or physical assets  such as aircraft railroad cars  shipping  containers  or oil rigs   They are most commonly issued to take advantage of the tax  benefits of leasing   For example suppose an airline finances the purchase of new aircraft  with equipment trust certificates   The legal title to the aircraft is held by the trustee  which issues equipment trust certificates to investors in the amount of the aircraft  purchase price  The trustee leases the aircraft to the airline and collects lease payments  from the airline to pay the interest on the certificates   When the certificates mature  the trustee sells the aircraft to the airline uses the proceeds to retire the principal and  cancels the lease  One of the most common forms of collateral for ABS is mortgaged property  MBS  are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage  loans  most commonly on residential property  Mortgage loans are purchased from  banks  mortgage companies  and other originators and then assembled into pools by  a governmental quasi  governmental or private entity  Financial institutions  particularly in Europe issue covered bonds   A covered  bond is a debt obligation backed by a segregated pool of assets called a  cover pool    Covered bonds are similar to ABS but offer bondholders additional protection if the  financial institution defaults   A financial institution that sponsors ABS transfers the  assets backing the bonds to a special legal entity  If the financial institution defaults   investors who hold bonds in the financial institution have no recourse against the  special legal entity and its pool of assets because the special legal entity is a bankruptcy   remote vehicle  the only recourse they have is against the financial institution itself   In contrast  in the case of covered bonds  the pool of assets remains on the financial  institution s balance sheet   In the event of default  bondholders have recourse against  both the financial institution and the cover pool  Thus  the cover pool serves as col  lateral  If the assets that are included in the cover pool become non  performing  i e   the assets are not generating the promised cash flows  the issuer must replace them  with performing assets   Therefore covered bonds usually carry lower credit risks and  offer lower yields than otherwise similar ABS 
4,319,      Credit Enhancements
5,319,Credit enhancements refer to a variety of provisions that can be used to reduce the  credit risk of a bond issue  Thus  they increase the issue s credit quality and decrease  the bond s yield  Credit enhancements are very often used when creating ABS  There are two primary types of credit enhancements  internal and external  Internal  credit enhancement relies on structural features regarding the bond issue  External  credit enhancement refers to financial guarantees received from a third party often  called a financial guarantor  We describe each type in the following sections           Internal Credit Enhancement The most common forms of internal credit  enhancement are subordination overcollateralization and reserve accounts   Subordination also known as credit tranching is the most popular internal credit  enhancement technique  It relies on creating more than one bond class or tranche  and ordering the claim priorities for ownership or interest in an asset between the  tranches   The cash flows generated by the assets are allocated with different priority  to tranches of different seniority  The ordering of the claim priorities is called a senior  subordinated structure where the tranches of highest seniority are called senior fol  lowed by subordinated or junior tranches   The subordinated tranches function as credit  protection for the more senior tranches  in the sense that the most senior tranche  has the first claim on available cash flows   This type of protection is also commonly  referred to as a waterfall structure because in the event of default  the proceeds from  liquidating assets will first be used to repay the most senior creditors   Thus  if the  issuer defaults  losses are allocated from the bottom up that is  from the most junior
1,320,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,320,   
3,320,to the most senior tranche  The most senior tranche is typically unaffected unless  losses exceed the amount of the subordinated tranches  which is why the most senior  tranche is usually rated Aaa AAA   Overcollateralization refers to the process of posting more collateral than is needed  to obtain or secure financing   It represents a form of internal credit enhancement  because the additional collateral can be used to absorb losses   For example if at issuance  the principal amount of a bond issue is      million and the value of the collateral is       million the amount of overcollateralization is     million  Over time the amount  of overcollateralization changes  for instance as a result of amortization prepayments  or defaults in the case of MBS  A major problem associated with overcollateralization  is the valuation of the collateral  For example one of the most significant contributors  to the           credit crisis was a valuation problem with the residential housing  assets backing MBS  Many properties were originally valued in excess of the worth  of the issued securities   But as property prices fell and homeowners started to default  on their mortgages  the credit quality of many MBS declined sharply  The result was  a rapid rise in yields and panic among investors in these securities   Reserve accounts or reserve funds are another form of internal credit enhance  ment and come in two forms  a cash reserve fund and an excess spread account  A cash  reserve fund is a deposit of cash that can be used to absorb losses   An excess spread  account involves the allocation into an account of any amounts left over after paying  out the interest to bondholders   The excess spread sometimes called excess interest  cash flow is the difference between the cash flow received from the assets used to  secure the bond issue and the interest paid to bondholders   The excess spread can be  retained and deposited into a reserve account that serves as a first line of protection  against losses   In a process called turboing  the excess spread can be used to retire the  principal with the most senior tranche having the first claim on these funds           External Credit Enhancement The most common forms of external credit  enhancement are bank guarantees and surety bonds  letters of credit and cash collat  eral accounts   Bank guarantees and surety bonds are very similar in nature because they both  reimburse bondholders for any losses incurred if the issuer defaults   However there  is usually a maximum amount that is guaranteed called the penal sum  The major  difference between a bank guarantee and a surety bond is that the former is issued  by a bank  whereas the latter is issued by a rated and regulated insurance company   Insurance companies that specialize in providing financial guarantees are typically  called monoline insurance companies or monoline insurers   Monoline insurers played  an important role in securitization until the           credit crisis   But financial  guarantees from monoline insurers have become a less common form of credit  enhancement since the credit crisis as a consequence of the financial difficulties and  credit rating downgrades that most monoline insurers experienced  A letter of credit from a financial institution is another form of external credit  enhancement for a bond issue  The financial institution provides the issuer with a credit  line to reimburse any cash flow shortfalls from the assets backing the issue  Letters of  credit have also become a less common form of credit enhancement since the credit  crisis as a result of the credit rating downgrades of several financial institutions that  were providers of letters of credit   Bank guarantees  surety bonds  and letters of credit expose the investor to third   party  or counterparty  risk that is  the possibility that a guarantor cannot meet  its obligations   A cash collateral account mitigates this concern because the issuer  immediately borrows the credit  enhancement amount and then invests that amount   usually in highly rated short  term commercial paper  Because a cash collateral account

2,321,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,321,is an actual deposit of cash rather than a pledge of cash a downgrade of the cash  collateral account provider will not necessarily result in a downgrade of the bond  issue backed by that provider

5,321,Bond covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the  time of a new bond issue  An indenture will frequently include affirmative  or positive   and negative covenants   Affirmative covenants enumerate what issuers are required  to do whereas negative covenants specify what issuers are prohibited from doing   Affirmative covenants are typically administrative in nature  For example fre  quently used affirmative covenants include what the issuer will do with the proceeds  from the bond issue and the promise of making the contractual payments   The issuer  may also promise to comply with all laws and regulations  maintain its current lines  of business  insure and maintain its assets  and pay taxes as they come due  These  types of covenants typically do not impose additional costs to the issuer and do not  materially constrain the issuer  s discretion regarding how to operate its business   In contrast negative covenants are frequently costly and do materially constrain the  issuer  s potential business decisions   The purpose of negative covenants is to protect  bondholders from such problems as the dilution of their claims  asset withdrawals  or substitutions  and suboptimal investments by the issuer  Examples of negative  covenants include the following     Restrictions on debt regulate the issue of additional debt   Maximum acceptable  debt usage ratios  sometimes called leverage ratios or gearing ratios  and min  imum acceptable interest coverage ratios are frequently specified permitting  new debt to be issued only when justified by the issuer  s financial condition     Negative pledges prevent the issuance of debt that would be senior to or rank in  priority ahead of the existing bondholders  debt      Restrictions on prior claims protect unsecured bondholders by preventing the  issuer from using assets that are not collateralized  called unencumbered assets   to become collateralized     Restrictions on distributions to shareholders restrict dividends and other  payments to shareholders such as share buy  backs  repurchases   The restric  tion typically operates by reference to the borrower  s profitability   that is  the  covenant sets a base date usually at or near the time of the issue and permits  dividends and share buy  backs only to the extent of a set percentage of earnings  or cumulative earnings after that date     Restrictions on asset disposals set a limit on the amount of assets that can be  disposed by the issuer during the bond s life  The limit on cumulative disposals  is typically set as a percentage of a company  s gross assets   The usual intent is to  protect bondholder claims by preventing a break  up of the company     Restrictions on investments constrain risky investments by blocking speculative  investments   The issuer is essentially forced to devote its capital to its going   concern business   A companion covenant may require the issuer to stay in its  present line of business      Restrictions on mergers and acquisitions prevent these actions unless the com  pany is the surviving company or unless the acquirer delivers a supplemental  indenture to the trustee expressly assuming the old bonds and terms of the old  indenture  These requirements effectively prevent a company from avoiding its  obligations to bondholders by selling out to another company 
1,322,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,322,   
3,322,These are only a few examples of negative covenants   The common characteristic of  all negative covenants is ensuring that the issuer will not take any actions that would  significantly reduce its ability to make interest payments and repay the principal   Bondholders  however rarely wish to be too specific about how an issuer should run  its business because doing so would imply a degree of control that bondholders legally  want to avoid  In addition very restrictive covenants may not be in the bondholders   best interest if they force the issuer to default when default is avoidable  For example  strict restrictions on debt may prevent the issuer from raising new funds that are  necessary to meet its contractual obligations   strict restrictions on asset disposals may  prohibit the issuer from selling assets or business units and obtaining the necessary  liquidity to make interest payments or principal repayments   and strict restrictions on  mergers and acquisitions may prevent the issuer from being taken over by a stronger  company that would be able to honor the issuer  s contractual obligations  
4,322,EXAMPLE  
5,322,  The term most likely used to refer to the legal contract under which a  bond is issued is   A  indenture  B debenture  C  letter of credit     The individual or entity that most likely assumes the role of trustee for a  bond issue is   A a financial institution appointed by the issuer  B  the treasurer or chief financial officer of the issuer  C a financial institution appointed by a regulatory authority    The individual or entity most likely responsible for the timely payment of  interest and repayment of principal to bondholders is the  A  trustee  B primary or lead bank of the issuer  C  treasurer or chief financial officer of the issuer    The major advantage of issuing bonds through a special legal entity is   A bankruptcy remoteness   B beneficial tax treatments   C greater liquidity and lower issuing costs     The category of bond most likely repaid from the repayment of previous  loans made by the issuer is   A  sovereign bonds   B  supranational bonds   C non  sovereign bonds     The type of collateral used to secure collateral trust bonds is most likely  A  securities   B mortgages   C physical assets     The external credit enhancement that has the least amount of third  party  risk is a  A  surety bond 
1,323,   
2,323,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,323,B  letter of credit   C cash collateral account     An example of an affirmative covenant is the requirement   A  that dividends will not exceed     of earnings   B  to insure and perform periodic maintenance on financed assets   C  that the debt  to  equity ratio will not exceed     and times interest  earned will not fall below        An example of a covenant that protects bondholders against the dilution  of their claims is a restriction on  A debt   B  investments   C mergers and acquisitions  
4,323,Solution to   
5,323,A is correct   The contract between a bond issuer and the bondholders is very  often called an indenture or deed trust   The indenture documents the terms of  the issue including the principal amount  the coupon rate and the payments  schedule  It also provides information about the funding sources for the contrac  tual payments and specifies whether there are any collateral credit enhancement  or covenants   B is incorrect because a debenture is a type of bond  C is incorrect  because a letter of credit is an external credit enhancement  
6,323,Solution to   
7,323,A is correct   The issuer chooses a financial institution with trust powers  such  as the trust department of a bank or a trust company to act as a trustee for the  bond issue 
8,323,Solution to   
9,323,A is correct   Although the issuer is ultimately the source of the contractual  payments  it is the trustee that ensures timely payments   Doing so is accom  plished by invoicing the issuer for interest payments and principal repayments  and holding the funds until they are paid 
10,323,Solution to   
11,323,A is correct   A special legal entity is a bankruptcy  remote vehicle  Bankruptcy  remoteness is achieved by transferring the assets from the sponsor to the special  legal entity  Once this transfer is completed the sponsor no longer has ownership  rights   If the sponsor defaults  no claims can be made to recover the assets that  were transferred or the proceeds from the transfer to the special legal entity 
12,323,Solution to   
13,323,B is correct   The source of payment for bonds issued by supranational organi  zations is either the repayment of previous loans made by the organization or  the paid  in capital of its member states   A is incorrect because national govern  ments rely on their taxing authority and money creation to repay their debt   C  is incorrect because non  sovereign bonds are typically repaid from the issuer  s  taxing authority or the cash flows of the project being financed 
1,324,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,324,   
3,324,Solution to   
4,324,A is correct   Collateral trust bonds are secured by securities  such as common  shares  other bonds  or other financial assets   B is incorrect because MBS are  secured by mortgages   C is incorrect because equipment trust certificates are  backed by physical assets such as aircraft  railroad cars  shipping containers   or oil rigs  
5,324,Solution to   
6,324,C is correct   The third  party  or counterparty  risk for a surety bond and a letter  of credit arises from both being future promises to pay  In contrast  a cash col  lateral account allows the issuer to immediately borrow the credit  enhancement  amount and then invest it  
7,324,Solution to   
8,324,B is correct   Affirmative covenants indicate what the issuer  must do  and are  administrative in nature  A covenant requiring the issuer to insure and perform  periodic maintenance on financed assets is an example of affirmative covenant    A and C are incorrect because they are negative covenants   they indicate what  the issuer cannot do 
9,324,Solution to   
10,324,A is correct  A restriction on debt typically takes the form of a maximum accept  able debt usage ratio or a minimum acceptable interest coverage ratio  Thus  it  limits the issuer  s ability to issue new debt that would dilute the bondholders   claims   B and C are incorrect because they are covenants that restrict the issu  er  s business activities by preventing the company from making investments or  being taken over respectively 
11,324,    Legal and Regulatory Considerations
12,324,Fixed  income securities are subject to different legal and regulatory require  ments depending on where they are issued and traded as well as who holds them   Unfortunately there are no unified legal and regulatory requirements that apply globally  An important consideration for investors is where the bonds are issued and traded  because it affects the laws and regulation that apply  The global bond markets consist  of national bond markets and the Eurobond market   A national bond market includes  all the bonds that are issued and traded in a specific country and denominated in  the currency of that country  Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in that  country are called domestic bonds  whereas bonds issued by entities that are incor  porated in another country are called foreign bonds   If Ford Motor Company issues  bonds denominated in US dollars in the United States  these bonds will be classified  as domestic  If Volkswagen Group or Toyota Motor Corporation  or their German  or Japanese subsidiaries  issue bonds denominated in US dollars in the United States   these bonds will be classified as foreign  Foreign bonds very often receive nicknames    For example foreign bonds are called  kangaroo bonds  in Australia   maple bonds  in  Canada   panda bonds  in China   Samurai bonds  in Japan  kimchi bonds  in South  Korea   matrioshka bonds  in Russia   matador bonds  in Spain  bulldog bonds  in  the United Kingdom and  Yankee bonds  in the United States   National regulators  may make distinctions both between and among resident and non  resident issuers   and they may have different requirements regarding the issuance process  the level  of disclosures  or the restrictions imposed on the bond issuer and or the investors  who can purchase the bonds

3,325,Governments and companies have issued foreign bonds in London since the   th  century and foreign bond issues expanded in such countries as the United States   Japan and Switzerland during the     s   But the     s saw the emergence of another  bond market   the Eurobond market   The Eurobond market was created primarily to  bypass the legal regulatory and tax constraints imposed on bond issuers and inves  tors  particularly in the United States   Bonds issued and traded on the Eurobond  market are called Eurobonds and they are named after the currency in which they  are denominated  For example Eurodollar and Euroyen bonds are denominated in  US dollars and Japanese yens  respectively  Bonds that are denominated in euros are  called euro  denominated Eurobonds   Eurobonds are typically less regulated than domestic and foreign bonds because  they are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country  They are usually unse  cured bonds and can be denominated in any currency including the issuer  s domestic  currency   They are underwritten by an international syndicate that is  a group  of financial institutions from different jurisdictions   Most Eurobonds are bearer  bonds meaning that the trustee does not keep records of who owns the bonds   only  the clearing system knows who the bond owners are  In contrast  most domestic  and foreign bonds are registered bonds for which ownership is recorded by either  name or serial number  Some investors may prefer bearer bonds to registered bonds   possibly for tax reasons   A reference is sometimes made to global bonds   A global bond is issued simulta  neously in the Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market   Issuing  bonds in several markets at the same time ensures that there is sufficient demand for  large bond issues  and that the bonds can be purchased by all investors  no matter  where these investors are located  For example the World Bank is a regular issuer of  global bonds   Many market participants refer to foreign bonds  Eurobonds  and global  bonds as international bonds as opposed to domestic bonds   The differences among domestic bonds  foreign bonds  Eurobonds  and global  bonds matter to investors because these bonds are subject to different legal regula  tory and as described in Section     tax requirements   They are also characterized by  differences in the frequency of interest payments and the way the interest payment is  calculated which affect the bond s cash flows and thus its price  Note however that  the currency in which a bond is denominated has a stronger effect on its price than  where the bond is issued or traded  This is because market interest rates have a strong  influence on a bond s price and the market interest rates that affect a bond are those  associated with the currency in which the bond is denominated  As the emergence and growth of the Eurobond market illustrates  legal and regula  tory considerations affect the dynamics of the global fixed  income markets   Exhibit    compares the amount of domestic and international debt outstanding for the     countries that were the largest domestic debt issuers at the end of December         The reported amounts are based on the residence of the issuer

19,326,B is correct   A domestic bond is issued by a local issuer denominated in local  currency and sold in the domestic market  Gilts are British pound  denominated  bonds issued by the UK Debt Management Office in the United Kingdom  Thus   they are UK domestic bonds   A is incorrect because a bond issued by LG Group

3,327,from South Korea  denominated in British pounds  and sold in the United  Kingdom is an example of a foreign bond  bulldog bond   C is incorrect because  a bond issued by Wal  Mart from the United States  denominated in US dollars   and sold in various countries in North America  Europe the Middle East  and  Asia Pacific is most likely an example of a global bond particularly if it is also  sold in the Eurobond market  
4,327,Solution to   
5,327,A is correct   A Eurobond is a bond that is issued internationally outside the  jurisdiction of any single country  Thus  a bond issued by Sony from Japan  denominated in US dollars but not registered with the SEC  is an example of a  Eurobond  B is incorrect because global bonds are bonds that are issued simul  taneously in the Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market   C  is incorrect because if Sony  s bond issue were a foreign bond  Yankee bond  it  would be registered with the SEC  
6,327,    Tax Considerations
7,327,Generally speaking  the income portion of a bond investment is taxed at the ordi  nary income tax rate which is typically the same tax rate that an individual would  pay on wage or salary income  Tax  exempt securities are the exception to this rule   For example interest income received by holders of local government bonds called  municipal bonds in the United States is often exempt from federal income tax and  from the income tax of the state in which the bonds are issued  The tax status of bond  income may also depend on where the bond is issued and traded  For example some  domestic bonds pay their interest net of income tax   Other bonds  including some  Eurobonds  make gross interest payments   In addition to earnings from interest  a bond investment may also generate a  capital gain or loss   If a bond is sold before its maturity date the price is likely to  have changed compared with the purchase price  This change will generate a capital  gain if the bond price has increased or a capital loss if the bond price has decreased   From the stand point of taxes  a capital gain or loss is usually treated differently from  taxable income  In addition in some countries  there is a different tax rate for long   term and short  term capital gains   For example capital gains that are recognized  more than    months after the original purchase date may be taxed at a long  term  capital gains tax rate whereas capital gains that are recognized within    months of  purchasing the investment may be taxed as a short  term capital gain  Very often the  tax rate for long  term capital gains is lower than the tax rate for short  term capital  gains  and the tax rate for short  term capital gains is equal to the ordinary income tax  rate although there are exceptions   Not all countries  however implement a capital  gains tax   Furthermore differences in national and local legislation often result in a  very diverse set of aggregate country capital gains tax rates   For bonds issued at a discount  an additional tax consideration is related to the  tax status of the original issue discount   The original issue discount is the difference  between the par value and the original issue price  In some countries  such as the United  States  a prorated portion of the discount must be included in interest income every  tax year  This is not the case in other countries  such as Japan  Exhibit    illustrates  the potential importance of this tax consideration 
1,328,Legal Regulatory and Tax Considerations
2,328,   
3,328,Exhibit  
4,328,Original Issue Discount Tax Provision
5,328,Assume a hypothetical country Z inland where the local currency is the zini   Z   The market interest rate in Z inland is     and both interest income and  capital gains are taxed  Companies A and B issue     year bonds with a par value  of Z      Company A issues a coupon bond with an annual coupon rate of       Investors buy Company A s bonds for Z      Every year they receive and pay  tax on their Z    annual interest payments   When Company A s bonds mature  bondholders receive the par value of Z      Company B issues a zero  coupon  bond at a discount   Investors buy Company B s bonds for Z        They do not  receive any cash flows until Company B pays the par value of Z     when the  bonds mature  Company A s bonds and Company B s bonds are economically identical in the  sense that they have the same maturity     years  and the same yield to maturity         Company A s bonds make periodic payments  however whereas Company  B s bonds defer payment until maturity  Investors in Company A s bonds must  include the annual interest payments in taxable income  When they receive  their original Z     investment back at maturity they face no capital gain or  loss   Without an original issue discount tax provision investors in Company  B s bonds do not have any taxable income until the bonds mature  When they  receive the par value at maturity they face a capital gain on the original issue  discount that is  on Z        Z       Z         The purpose of an original  issue discount tax provision is to tax investors in Company B s bonds the same  way as investors in Company A s bonds   Thus  a prorated portion of the Z        original issue discount is included in taxable income every tax year until maturity   This allows investors in Company B s bonds to increase their cost basis in the  bonds so that at maturity they face no capital gain or loss  
6,328,Some jurisdictions also have tax provisions for bonds bought at a premium  They  may allow investors to deduct a prorated portion of the amount paid in excess of the  bond s par value from their taxable income every tax year until maturity  For example  if an investor pays       for a bond that has a par value of       and matures five  years later she can deduct    from her taxable income every tax year for five years    But the deduction may not be required  the investor may have the choice either to  deduct a prorated portion of the premium each year or to deduct nothing and declare  a capital loss when the bond is redeemed at maturity 
7,328,EXAMPLE  
8,328,  The coupon payment is most likely to be taxed as   A ordinary income  B  short  term capital gain  C  long  term capital gain    Assume that a company issues bonds in the hypothetical country of  Z inland where the local currency is the zini  Z   There is an original  issue discount tax provision in Z inland s tax code  The company issues a      year zero  coupon bond with a par value of Z     and sells it for Z      An investor who buys the zero  coupon bond at issuance and holds it until  maturity most likely

4,329,A has to include Z   in his taxable income every tax year for    years  and has to declare a capital gain of Z    at maturity  B has to include Z   in his taxable income every tax year for    years  and does not have to declare a capital gain at maturity  C does not have to include anything in his taxable income every tax year  for    years but has to declare a capital gain of Z    at maturity 
5,329,Solution to   
6,329,A is correct   Interest income is typically taxed at the ordinary income tax rate  which may be the same tax rate that individuals pay on wage and salary income 
7,329,Solution to   
8,329,B is correct   The original issue discount tax provision requires the investor to  include a prorated portion of the original issue discount in his taxable income  every tax year until maturity  The original issue discount is the difference between  the par value and the original issue price that is  Z       Z      Z     The  bond s maturity is    years   Thus  the prorated portion that must be included  each year is Z           Z    The original issue discount tax provision allows the  investor to increase his cost basis in the bond so that when the bond matures   the investor faces no capital gain or loss  
9,329,STRUCTURE OF A BOND S CASH FLOWS
10,329,The most common payment structure by far is that of a plain vanilla bond as depicted  in Exhibit     These bonds make periodic fixed coupon payments and a lump  sum  payment of principal at maturity  But there are other structures regarding both the  principal repayment and the interest payments   This section discusses the major  schedules observed in the global fixed  income markets   Schedules for principal  repayments and interest payments are typically similar for a particular type of bond  such as     year US Treasury bonds   However payment schedules vary considerably  between types of bonds  such as government bonds versus corporate bonds  
11,329,    Principal Repayment Structures
12,329,How the amount borrowed is repaid is an important consideration for investors  because it affects the level of credit risk they face from holding the bonds   Any pro  vision that periodically retires some of the principal amount outstanding is a way to  reduce credit risk  
13,329,      Bullet Fully Amortized and Partially Amortized Bonds
14,329,The payment structure of a plain vanilla bond has been used for nearly every govern  ment bond ever issued as well as for the majority of corporate bonds   Such a bond is  also known as a bullet bond because the entire payment of principal occurs at maturity  In contrast  an amortizing bond has a payment schedule that calls for periodic  payments of interest and repayments of principal  A bond that is fully amortized is  characterized by a fixed periodic payment schedule that reduces the bond s outstanding  principal amount to zero by the maturity date  A partially amortized bond also makes  fixed periodic payments until maturity but only a portion of the principal is repaid  by the maturity date  Thus  a balloon payment is required at maturity to retire the  bond s outstanding principal amount

3,330,Exhibit   illustrates the differences in the payment schedules for a bullet bond a  fully amortized bond and a partially amortized bond  For the three bonds  the prin  cipal amount is       the maturity is five years  the coupon rate is    and interest  payments are made annually  The market interest rate used to discount the bonds   expected cash flows until maturity is assumed to be constant at     The bonds are  issued and redeemed at par  For the partially amortized bond the balloon payment  is      at maturity

3,331,Investors pay       now to purchase any of the three bonds   For the bullet bond  they receive the coupon payment of                  every year for five years   The  last payment is       because it includes both the last coupon payment and the  principal amount   For the fully amortized bond the annual payment which includes both the coupon  payment and the principal repayment  is constant   Thus  this annual payment can be  viewed as an annuity  This annuity lasts for five years   its present value discounted  at the market interest rate of    is equal to the bond price of        Therefore the  annual payment is          The first year the interest part of the payment is                   which implies that the principal repayment part is                           This repayment leaves an outstanding principal amount  which becomes the basis for  the calculation of the interest the following year of                            The  second year the interest part of the payment is                       the principal  repayment part is                            and the outstanding principal amount  is                              The fifth year the outstanding principal amount is  fully repaid  Note that the annual payment is constant but  over time the interest  payment decreases and the principal repayment increases   The partially amortized bond can be viewed as the combination of two elements   a  five  year annuity plus the balloon payment at maturity  The sum of the present values  of these two elements is equal to the bond price of        As for the fully amortized  bond the discount rate is the market interest rate of    making the constant amount  for the annuity          This amount represents the annual payment for the first four  years   For Years   through   the split between interest and principal is done the same  way as for the fully amortized bond  The interest part of the payment is equal to     multiplied by the outstanding principal at the end of the previous year   the principal  repayment part is equal to         minus the interest part of the payment for the year   and the outstanding principal amount at the end of the year is equal to the outstanding  principal amount at the end of the previous year minus the principal repayment for  the year  In Year   investors receive          this amount is calculated either as the  sum of the interest payment          and the outstanding principal amount            or as the constant amount of the annuity           plus the balloon payment          As for the fully amortized bond the interest payment decreases and the principal  repayment increases over time  Because the principal amount is not fully amortized  interest payments are higher for the partially amortized bond than for the fully amor  tized bond except the first year when they are equal  Exhibit    does not address the complexity of the repayment structure for some  bonds  such as many ABS  For example MBS face prepayment risk  which is the  possible early repayment of mortgage principal  Borrowers usually have the right to  prepay mortgages  which typically occurs when a current homeowner purchases a  new home or when homeowners refinance their mortgages because market interest  rates have fallen 
4,331,EXAMPLE  
5,331,  The structure that requires the largest repayment of principal at maturity  is that of a  A bullet bond  B  fully amortized bond  C partially amortized bond 
1,332,Structure of a Bond s Cash Flows
2,332,   
3,332,  A plain vanilla bond has a maturity of    years  a par value of      and  a coupon rate of     Interest payments are made annually  The market  interest rate is assumed to be constant at     The bond is issued and  redeemed at par  The principal repayment the first year is closest to  A        B        C           Relative to a fully amortized bond the coupon payments of an otherwise  similar partially amortized bond are  A  lower or equal  B equal  C higher or equal 
4,332,Solution to   
5,332,A is correct  The entire repayment of principal occurs at maturity for a bullet  or  plain vanilla  bond whereas it occurs over time for fully and partially amortized  bonds   Thus  the largest repayment of principal at maturity is that of a bullet bond 
6,332,Solution to   
7,332,A is correct   A plain vanilla  or bullet  bond does not make any principal repay  ment until the maturity date  B is incorrect because       would be the principal  repayment for a fully amortized bond 
8,332,Solution to   
9,332,C is correct   Except at maturity the principal repayments are lower for a  partially amortized bond than for an otherwise similar fully amortized bond   Consequently the principal amounts outstanding and therefore the amounts  of interest payments are higher for a partially amortized bond than for a fully  amortized bond all else equal  The only exception is the first interest payment   which is the same for both repayment structures   This is because no principal  repayment has been made by the time the first coupon is paid 
10,332,      Sinking Fund Arrangements
11,332,A sinking fund arrangement is another approach that can be used to achieve the same  goal of periodically retiring the bond s principal outstanding   The term sinking fund  refers to an issuer  s plans to set aside funds over time to retire the bond  Originally  a sinking fund was a specified cash reserve that was segregated from the rest of the  issuer  s business for the purpose of repaying the principal  More generally today a  sinking fund arrangement specifies the portion of the bond s principal outstanding   perhaps    that must be repaid each year throughout the bond s life or after a spec  ified date  This repayment occurs whether or not an actual segregated cash reserve  has been created  Typically the issuer will forward repayment proceeds to the bond s trustee  The  trustee will then either redeem bonds to this value or select by lottery the serial  numbers of bonds to be paid off  The bonds for repayment may be listed in business  newspapers  such as the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times  As well as the standard  version described above another type of sinking fund  arrangement operates by redeeming a steadily increasing amount of the bond s notional  principal  total amount  each year  Any remaining principal is then redeemed at

2,333,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,333,maturity  It is common to find utility and energy companies in the United States  the  United Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries that issue bonds with sinking  fund arrangements that incorporate such a provision  Another common variation is for the bond issue to include a call provision which  gives the issuer the option to repurchase the bonds before maturity callable bonds  are discussed in Section      The issuer can usually repurchase the bonds at the market  price at par or at a specified sinking fund price whichever is the lowest   To allocate  the burden of the call provision fairly among bondholders  the bonds to be retired are  selected at random based on serial number  Usually the issuer can repurchase only  a small portion of the bond issue  Some indentures  however allow issuers to use a  doubling option to repurchase double the required number of bonds   The benefit of a sinking fund arrangement is that it ensures that a formal plan is  in place for retiring the debt   For an investor a sinking fund arrangement reduces  the risk the issuer will default when the principal is due thereby reducing the credit  risk of the bond issue  But investors experience potential disadvantages with sinking  fund arrangements   First  investors face reinvestment risk  the risk associated with  having to reinvest cash flows at an interest rate that may be lower than the current  yield to maturity  If the serial number of an investor  s bonds is selected the bonds  will be repaid and the investor will have to reinvest the proceeds   If market interest  rates have fallen since the investor purchased the bonds  he or she probably will not  be able to purchase a bond offering the same return  Another potential disadvantage  for investors occurs if the issuer has the option to repurchase bonds at below market  prices   For example an issuer could exercise a call option to buy back bonds at par  on bonds priced above par  In this case investors would suffer a loss   Exhibit   illustrates an example of a sinking fund arrangement

6,334,    Coupon Payment Structures
7,334,A coupon is the interest payment that the bond issuer makes to the bondholder  A  conventional bond pays a fixed periodic coupon over a specified time to maturity   Most frequently the coupon is paid semi  annually for sovereign and corporate bonds    this is the case in the United States  the United Kingdom and Commonwealth coun  tries such as Bangladesh India  and New Zealand  Eurobonds usually pay an annual  coupon although some Eurobonds make quarterly coupon payments   The norm for  bonds issued in the eurozone is for an annual coupon although there are exceptions   Fixed  rate coupons are not the only coupon payment structure however  A wide  range of coupon types is offered in the global fixed  income markets   This variety exists  to meet the differing needs of both issuers and investors  
8,334,      Floating  Rate Notes
9,334,Floating  rate notes do not have a fixed coupon  instead their coupon rate is linked  to an external reference rate such as Libor  Thus  a FRN s interest rate will fluctuate  periodically during the bond s life following the changes in the reference rate  As a  consequence the FRN s cash flows are not known with certainty  Large issuers of  FRNs include government  sponsored enterprises  GSEs  such as the Federal Home  Loan Banks  FHLB  the Federal National Mortgage Association   Fannie Mae   and  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation   Freddie Mac   in the United States   as well as banks and financial institutions in Europe and Asia Pacific  It is rare for  national governments to issue FRNs because investors in sovereign bonds generally  prefer fixed  coupon bonds   Almost all FRNs have quarterly coupons  although counter examples do exist    FRNs usually pay a fixed spread over the specified reference rate  A typical coupon  rate may be the three  month US dollar Libor      bps  i e  Libor          for a US  dollar  denominated bond or the three  month Euribor      bps for a euro  denominated  FRN  Occasionally the spread is not fixed  in this case the bond is known as a variable 
10,334,Contrary to plain vanilla  fixed  rate securities that decline in value in a rising  interest rate environment  FRNs are less affected when interest rates increase because  their coupon rates vary with market interest rates and are reset at regular short  term  intervals   Thus  FRNs have little interest rate risk that is  the risk that a change in  market interest rate affects a bond s value  FRNs are frequently favored by investors  who expect that interest rates will rise  That said investors still face credit risk when  investing in FRNs   If an issuer  s credit risk does not change from one coupon reset  date to the next  the FRN s price generally will stay close to the par value  However  if there is a change in the issuer  s credit quality that affects the perceived credit risk  associated with the bond the price of the FRN will deviate from its par value  A higher  level of credit risk will lead to a lower price and a higher yield 
11,334,rate note 
1,335,   
2,335,Reading      Fixed  Income Securities  Defining Elements
3,335,Additional features observed in FRNs may include a floor or a cap  A floor  floored  FRN  prevents the coupon from falling below a specified minimum rate  This feature  benefits the bondholders  who are guaranteed that the interest rate will not fall below  the specified rate during a time of falling interest rates   In contrast  a cap  capped  FRN  prevents the coupon from rising above a specified maximum rate  This feature  benefits the issuer because it sets a limit to the interest rate paid on the debt during a  time of rising interest rates   It is also possible to have a collared FRN which includes  both a cap and a floor  An inverse or reverse FRN or simply an inverse floater is a bond whose coupon  rate has an inverse relationship to the reference rate  The basic structure is the same  as an ordinary FRN except for the direction in which the coupon rate is adjusted   When interest rates fall the coupon rate on an ordinary FRN decreases   in contrast   the coupon rate on a reverse FRN increases   Thus  inverse FRNs are typically favored  by investors who expect interest rates to decline 
4,335,      Step  Up Coupon Bonds
5,335,The coupon of a step  up coupon bond which may be fixed or floating  increases by  specified margins at specified dates   An example of a bond with a step  up coupon  is the FRN that was issued by the British bank HBOS plc in       This FRN had a      year maturity and the coupon was linked to the three  month Libor plus an initial  spread of    bps   The spread was scheduled to increase to     bps over Libor in       for the bond s tenor  Bonds with step  up coupons offer bondholders some protection against rising  interest rates  and they may be an important feature for callable bonds   When inter  est rates increase there is a higher likelihood that the issuer will not call the bonds   particularly if the bonds have a fixed rate of interest   The step  up coupon allows  bondholders to receive a higher coupon in line with the higher market interest rates    Alternatively when interest rates decrease or remain stable the step  up feature acts as  an incentive for the issuer to call the bond before the spread increases and the interest  expense rises   Thus  at issuance most investors viewed the bond issued by HBOS as  a     year investment  given that they expected the issuer to redeem it after    years  to avoid paying the higher coupon  Redeeming the bond when the spread increases is not automatic however   the  issuer may choose to keep the bond despite its increasing cost   This may happen  if refinancing the bond is necessary and alternatives are less advantageous for this  issuer  For example a financial crisis may make it difficult for the issuer to refinance   Alternatively the issuer  s credit quality may have deteriorated which would lead to a  higher spread potentially making the coupon rate on the new bond more expensive  than that on the existing bond despite the stepped  up coupon  Although the issuer does  not have to call the bond before the spread increases  there is an implicit expectation  from investors that it will  Failure to do so may be viewed negatively by market par  ticipants and reduce investors  appetite for that particular issuer  s bonds in the future 
6,335,      Credit  Linked Coupon Bonds
7,335,A credit  linked coupon bond has a coupon that changes when the bond s credit  rating changes   An example of a bond with a credit  linked coupon is one of British  Telecom s bonds maturing in       It has a coupon rate of    but the coupon will  increase by    bps for every credit rating downgrade below the bond s credit rating  at the time of issuance and will decrease by    bps for every credit rating upgrade  above the bond s credit rating at the time of issuance  Bonds with credit  linked coupons are attractive to investors who are concerned  about the future creditworthiness of the issuer  They may also provide some general  protection against a poor economy because credit ratings tend to decline the most
1,336,Structure of a Bond s Cash Flows
2,336,   
3,336,during recessions   A potential problem associated with these bonds is that increases  in the coupon payments resulting from a downgrade may ultimately result in further  deteriorations of the credit rating or even contribute to the issuer  s default  
4,336,      Payment  in  Kind Coupon Bonds
5,336,A payment  in  kind  PIK  coupon bond typically allows the issuer to pay interest in  the form of additional amounts of the bond issue rather than as a cash payment   Such  bonds are favored by issuers who are concerned that the issuer may face potential cash  flow problems in the future  They are used for example in financing companies that  have a high debt burden such as companies going through a leveraged buyout  a form  of acquisition in which the financing consists primarily of debt   Because investors are  aware of the additional credit risk associated with these bonds  they usually demand  a higher yield for holding bonds with PIK coupons   Other forms of PIK arrangements can also be found such as paying the bond  holders with common shares worth the amount of coupon due  With a PIK toggle  note the borrower has the option for each interest period to pay interest in cash  to make the interest payment in kind or some mix of the two  Cash payments or  payments in kind are frequently at the discretion of the borrower but whether the  payment is made in cash or in kind can be determined by an earnings or cash flow  trigger identified in the indenture 
6,336,      Deferred Coupon Bonds
7,336,A deferred coupon bond sometimes called a split coupon bond pays no coupons for  its first few years but then pays a higher coupon than it otherwise normally would for  the remainder of its life  Issuers of deferred coupon bonds are usually seeking ways to  conserve cash in the years immediately following the bond issue which may indicate  poorer credit quality  Deferred coupon bonds are also common in project financing  when the assets being developed do not generate any income during the development  phase  A deferred coupon bond allows the issuer to delay interest payments until the  project is completed and the cash flows generated by the assets being financed can  be used to service the debt   One of the main advantages of investing in a deferred coupon bond is that these  bonds are typically priced at significant discounts to par  Investors may also find the  deferred coupon structure to be very helpful in managing taxes   If taxes due on the  interest income can be delayed investors may be able to minimize taxes   This tax  advantage however depends on the jurisdiction concerned and how its tax rules  apply to deferred coupon payments   A zero  coupon bond can be thought of as an extreme form of deferred coupon  bond  These securities pay no interest to the investor and thus are issued at a deep  discount to par value  At maturity the bondholder receives the par value of the bond  as payment  Effectively a zero  coupon bond defers all interest payments until maturity 
8,336,      Index  Linked Bonds
9,336,An index  linked bond has its coupon payments and or principal repayment linked to  a specified index   In theory a bond can be indexed to any published variable includ  ing an index reflecting prices  earnings  economic output  commodities  or foreign  currencies   Inflation  linked bonds are an example of index  linked bonds   They offer  investors protection against inflation by linking a bond s coupon payments and or the  principal repayment to an index of consumer prices such as the UK Retail Price Index   RPI  or the US Consumer Price Index  CPI   The advantage of using the RPI or CPI  is that these indexes are well  known transparent  and published regularly

3,337,Governments are large issuers of inflation  linked bonds  also called linkers  The  United Kingdom was one of the first developed countries to issue inflation  linked  bonds in      offering gilts linked to the UK RPI its main measure of the rate of  inflation  In      the US Treasury began introducing Treasury inflation  indexed  securities  TIIS  or Treasury inflation  protected securities  TIPS  linked to the US CPI   Inflation  linked bonds are now more frequently being offered by corporate issuers   including both financial and non  financial companies   A bond s stated coupon rate represents the nominal interest rate received by  the bondholders   But inflation reduces the actual value of the interest received  The  interest rate that bondholders actually receive net of inflation is the real interest rate   it is approximately equal to the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation  By  increasing the coupon payments and or the principal repayment in line with increases  in the price index  inflation  linked bonds reduce inflation risk   An example of an  inflation  linked bond is the       UK Treasury index  linked gilt maturing in        Bondholders receive a real interest rate of       and the actual interest payments  are adjusted in line with changes in the UK RPI  Exhibit    shows the national governments that issue the largest amounts of  inflation  linked bonds   These sovereign issuers can be grouped into three categories    Countries such as Brazil Chile and Colombia have issued inflation  linked bonds  because they were experiencing extremely high rates of inflation when borrowing  and  offering inflation  linked bonds was their only available alternative to raise funds   The  second category includes the United Kingdom Australia  and Sweden  These countries  have issued inflation  linked bonds in an effort to add credibility to the government s  commitment to disinflationary policies and also to capitalize on the demand from  investors still concerned about inflation risk   The third category which includes the  United States  Canada  Germany and France consists of national governments that  are most concerned about the social welfare benefits associated with inflation  linked  securities   Theoretically inflation  linked bonds provide investors the benefit of a  long  term asset with a fixed real return that is free from inflation risk

7,340,B is correct   Most FRNs pay interest quarterly and are tied to a three  month  reference rate such as Libor 
8,340,Solution to   
9,340,C is correct  Because interest is effectively deferred until maturity a zero  coupon  bond can be thought of as a deferred coupon bond  A and B are incorrect because  both step  up bonds and credit  linked bonds pay regular coupons   For a step  up  bond the coupon increases by specified margins at specified dates   For a credit   linked bond the coupon changes when the bond s credit rating changes  
10,340,Solution to   
11,340,C is correct   The coupon rate on an inverse FRN has an inverse relationship  to the reference rate  Thus  an inverse FRN does not offer protection to the  investor when market interest rates increase but when they decrease  A and B  are incorrect because step  up bonds and FRNs both offer protection against  increases in market interest rates  
12,340,Solution to   
13,340,A is correct   TIPS have a fixed coupon rate and the principal is adjusted based  on changes in the CPI  Thus  TIPS are an example of capital  indexed bonds   B  is incorrect because with an interest  index bond it is the principal repayment  at maturity that is fixed and the coupon that is linked to an index   C is incorrect  because indexed  annuity bonds are fully amortized bonds  not bullet bonds   The  annuity payment  interest payment and principal repayment  is adjusted based  on changes in an index  
14,340,Solution to   
15,340,B is correct   Following an increase in inflation the coupon rate of a capital   indexed bond remains unchanged but the principal amount is adjusted upward  for inflation  Thus  the coupon payment  which is equal to the fixed coupon rate  multiplied by the inflation  adjusted principal amount  increases

17,340,A contingency refers to some future event or circumstance that is possible but not  certain  A contingency provision is a clause in a legal document that allows for some  action if the event or circumstance does occur  For bonds  the term embedded option  refers to various contingency provisions found in the indenture  These contingency  provisions provide the issuer or the bondholders the right  but not the obligation to  take some action  These rights are called  options    These options are not independent  of the bond and cannot be traded separately hence the term  embedded   Some com  mon types of bonds with embedded options include callable bonds  putable bonds   and convertible bonds   The options embedded in these bonds grant either the issuer  or the bondholders certain rights affecting the disposal or redemption of the bond

3,341,    Callable Bonds
4,341,The most widely used embedded option is the call provision  A callable bond gives  the issuer the right to redeem all or part of the bond before the specified maturity  date  The primary reason why issuers choose to issue callable bonds rather than non   callable bonds is to protect themselves against a decline in interest rates   This decline  can come either from market interest rates falling or from the issuer  s credit quality  improving   If market interest rates fall or credit quality improves  the issuer of a callable  bond has the right to replace an old expensive bond issue with a new cheaper bond  issue  In other words  the issuer can benefit from a decline in interest rates by being  able to refinance its debt at a lower interest rate  For example assume that the market  interest rate was    at the time of issuance and that a company issued a bond with a  coupon rate of    the market interest rate plus a spread of     bps   Now assume that  the market interest rate has fallen to    and that the company  s creditworthiness has  not changed  it can still issue at the market interest rate plus     bps   If the original  bond is callable the company can redeem it and replace it with a new bond paying     annually  If the original bond is non  callable the company must carry on paying     annually and cannot benefit from the decline in market interest rates   As illustrated in this example callable bonds are advantageous to the issuer of  the security  Put another way the call option has value to the issuer  Callable bonds  present investors with a higher level of reinvestment risk than non  callable bonds    that is  if the bonds are called bondholders have to reinvest funds in a lower interest  rate environment   For this reason callable bonds have to offer a higher yield and  sell at a lower price than otherwise similar non  callable bonds   The higher yield and  lower price compensate the bondholders for the value of the call option to the issuer  Callable bonds have a long tradition and are commonly issued by corporate issuers    Although first issued in the US market  they are now frequently issued in every major  bond market and in a variety of forms   The details about the call provision are specified in the indenture  These details  include the call price which represents the price paid to bondholders when the bond  is called  The call premium is the amount over par paid by the issuer if the bond is  called  There may be restrictions on when the bond can be called or the bond may  have different call prices depending on when it is called  The call schedule specifies  the dates and prices at which a bond may be called  Some callable bonds are issued  with a call protection period also called lockout period cushion or deferment period   The call protection period prohibits the issuer from calling a bond early in its life and  is often added as an incentive for investors to buy the bond  The earliest time that a  bond might be called is known as the call date  Make  whole calls first appeared in the US corporate bond market in the mid      s  and have become more commonplace ever since  A typical make  whole call requires  the issuer to make a lump  sum payment to the bondholders based on the present value  of the future coupon payments and principal repayment not paid because of the bond  being redeemed early  The discount rate used is usually some pre  determined spread  over the yield to maturity of an appropriate sovereign bond  The typical result is a  redemption value that is significantly greater than the bond s current market price  A  make  up call provision is less detrimental to bondholders than a regular call provision  because it allows them to be compensated if the issuer calls the bond  Issuers  however  rarely invoke this provision because redeeming a bond that includes a make  whole  provision before the maturity date is costly  Issuers tend to include a make  whole  provision as a  sweetener  to make the bond issue more attractive to potential buyers  and allow them to pay a lower coupon rate  Available exercise styles on callable bonds include the following     American  style call sometimes referred to as continuously callable for which  the issuer has the right to call a bond at any time starting on the first call date

3,342,   European  style call for which the issuer has the right to call a bond only once  on the call date     Bermuda  style call for which the issuer has the right to call bonds on specified  dates following the call protection period  These dates frequently correspond to  coupon payment dates

17,342,Solution to

21,342,Solution to   
22,342,A is correct   The bond is callable every    August from      that is  on spec  ified dates following the call protection period  Thus  the embedded option is  a Bermuda call

3,343,    Putable Bonds
4,343,A put provision gives the bondholders the right to sell the bond back to the issuer  at a pre  determined price on specified dates   Putable bonds are beneficial for the  bondholder by guaranteeing a pre  specified selling price at the redemption dates   If  interest rates rise after the issue date thus depressing the bond s price the bondholders  can put the bond back to the issuer and get cash  This cash can be reinvested in bonds  that offer higher yields  in line with the higher market interest rates   Because a put provision has value to the bondholders the price of a putable bond  will be higher than the price of an otherwise similar bond issued without the put  provision  Similarly the yield on a bond with a put provision will be lower than the  yield on an otherwise similar non  putable bond  The lower yield compensates the  issuer for the value of the put option to the investor  The indenture lists the redemption dates and the prices applicable to the sale of  the bond back to the issuer  The selling price is usually the par value of the bond   Depending on the terms set out in the indenture putable bonds may allow buyers  to force a sellback only once or multiple times during the bond s life  Putable bonds  that incorporate a single sellback opportunity include a European  style put and are  often referred to as one  time put bonds   Putable bonds that allow multiple sellback  opportunities include a Bermuda  style put and are known as multiple put bonds    Multiple put bonds offer more flexibility for investors  so they are generally more  expensive than one  time put bonds     Typically putable bonds incorporate one  to five  year put provisions   Their increas  ing popularity has often been motivated by investors wanting to protect themselves  against major declines in bond prices   One benefit of this rising popularity has been  an improvement in liquidity in some markets  because the put protection attracts  more conservative classes of investors   The global financial crisis that started in       showed that these securities can often exacerbate liquidity problems  however because  they provide a first claim on the issuer  s assets   The put provision gives bondholders  the opportunity to convert their claim into cash before other creditors  
5,343,    Convertible Bonds
6,343,A convertible bond is a hybrid security with both debt and equity features   It gives the  bondholder the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of common shares  in the issuing company  Thus  a convertible bond can be viewed as the combination of  a straight bond  option  free bond  plus an embedded equity call option  Convertible  bonds can also include additional provisions  the most common being a call provision  From the investor  s perspective a convertible bond offers several advantages relative  to a non  convertible bond  First  it gives the bondholder the ability to convert into  equity in case of share price appreciation and thus participate in the equity upside  At  the same time the bondholder receives downside protection  if the share price does  not appreciate the convertible bond offers the comfort of regular coupon payments  and the promise of principal repayment at maturity  Even if the share price and thus  the value of the equity call option decline the price of a convertible bond cannot fall  below the price of the straight bond  Consequently the value of the straight bond acts  as a floor for the price of the convertible bond  Because the conversion provision is valuable to bondholders the price of a con  vertible bond is higher than the price of an otherwise similar bond without the con  version provision  Similarly the yield on a convertible bond is lower than the yield on
7,343,  Although a bond could theoretically include an American  type put  there is no such bond outstanding  as of July       The likely reason for the absence of continuously putable bonds is that issuers would not  like to be surprised with having to raise cash to redeem the bonds at indeterminate times

3,344,an otherwise similar non  convertible bond  However most convertible bonds offer  investors a yield advantage  the coupon rate on the convertible bond is typically higher  than the dividend yield on the underlying common share  From the issuer  s perspective convertible bonds offer two main advantages   The  first is reduced interest expense  Issuers are usually able to offer below  market coupon  rates because of investors  attraction to the conversion feature  The second advantage  is the elimination of debt if the conversion option is exercised  But the conversion  option is dilutive to existing shareholders   Key terms regarding the conversion provision include the following     The conversion price is the price per share at which the convertible bond can  be converted into shares      The conversion ratio is the number of common shares that each bond can be  converted into  The indenture sometimes does not stipulate the conversion ratio  but only mentions the conversion price  The conversion ratio is equal to the par  value divided by the conversion price  For example if the par value is        and the conversion price is     the conversion ratio is                    or     common shares per bond     The conversion value sometimes called the parity value is the current share  price multiplied by the conversion ratio  For example if the current share price  is     and the conversion ratio is      the conversion value is                     The conversion premium is the difference between the convertible bond s price  and its conversion value  For example if the convertible bond s price is        and the conversion value is      the conversion premium is                         Conversion parity occurs if the conversion value is equal to the convertible  bond s price  Using the previous two examples  if the current share price is      instead of     then both the convertible bond s price and the conversion value  are equal to        i e  a conversion premium equal to     This condition is  referred to as parity  If the common share is selling for less than     the con  dition is below parity  In contrast  if the common share is selling for more than      the condition is above parity  Generally convertible bonds have maturities of five to    years   First  time or  younger issuers are usually able to issue convertible bonds of up to three years in  maturity only  Although it is common for convertible bonds to reach conversion  parity before maturity bondholders rarely exercise the conversion option before that  time  Early conversion would eliminate the yield advantage of continuing to hold the  convertible bond  investors would typically receive in dividends less than they would  receive in coupon payments   For this reason it is common to find convertible bonds  that are also callable by the issuer on a set of specified dates   If the convertible bond  includes a call provision and the conversion value is above the current share price  the issuer may force the bondholders to convert their bonds into common shares  before maturity  For this reason callable convertible bonds have to offer a higher  yield and sell at a lower price than otherwise similar non  callable convertible bonds    Some indentures specify that the bonds can be called only if the share price exceeds  a specified price giving investors more predictability about the share price at which  the issuer may force conversion  Although somewhat similar in purpose to a conversion option a warrant is actu  ally not an embedded option but rather an  attached  option  A warrant entitles the  holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a fixed exercise price  until the expiration date  Warrants are considered yield enhancements   they are fre  quently attached to bond issues as a  sweetener   Warrants are actively traded in some  financial markets  such as the Deutsche B rse and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange

3,345,Several European banks have been issuing a type of convertible bond called  contingent convertible bonds   Contingent convertible bonds nicknamed  CoCos    are bonds with contingent write  down provisions   Two main features distinguish  bonds with contingent write  down provisions from the traditional convertible bonds  just described  A traditional convertible bond is convertible at the option of the  bondholder and conversion occurs on the upside that is  if the issuer  s share price  increases   In contrast  bonds with contingent write  down provisions are convertible  on the downside  In the case of CoCos  conversion is automatic if a specified event  occurs for example if the bank s core Tier   capital ratio  a measure of the bank s  proportion of core equity capital available to absorb losses  falls below the minimum  requirement set by the regulators   Thus  in the event that the bank experiences losses  that reduce its equity capital below the minimum requirement  CoCos are a way to  reduce the bank s likelihood of default and therefore systemic risk that is  the risk  of failure of the financial system  When the bank s core Tier   capital falls below the  minimum requirement  the CoCos immediately convert into equity automatically  recapitalizing the bank  lightening the debt burden and reducing the risk of default    Because the conversion is not at the option of the bondholders but automatic CoCos  force bondholders to take losses   For this reason CoCos must offer a higher yield than  otherwise similar bonds   Exhibit   shows the relative importance of plain vanilla  straight fixed  rate  floating   rate and equity  related bonds to the total amount of international bonds outstanding    It indicates that the majority of bond issues are plain vanilla bonds

5,346,A is correct   A warrant is a separate tradable security that entitles the holder to  buy the underlying common share of the issuing company  B and C are incorrect  because the call provision and the conversion provision are embedded options

7,346,B is correct   The call provision is an option that benefits the issuer  Because of  this  callable bonds sell at lower prices and higher yields relative to otherwise  similar non  callable bonds   A and C are incorrect because the put provision  and the conversion provision are options that benefit the investor  Thus  putable  bonds and convertible bonds sell at higher prices and lower yields relative to  otherwise similar bonds that lack those provisions  
8,346,Solution to   
9,346,C is correct   Reinvestment risk refers to the effect that lower interest rates have  on available rates of return when reinvesting the cash flows received from an  earlier investment   Because bonds are typically called following a decline in  market interest rates  reinvestment risk is particularly relevant for the holder  of a callable bond  A is incorrect because credit risk refers to the risk of loss  resulting from the issuer failing to make full and timely payments of interest  and or repayments of principal  B is incorrect because interest rate risk is the  risk that a change in market interest rate affects a bond s value  Credit risk and  interest rate risk are not inherent to callable bonds

4,347,This reading provides an introduction to the salient features of fixed  income securities  while noting how these features vary among different types of securities   Important  points include the following     The three important elements that an investor needs to know when investing in  a fixed  income security are     the bond s features  which determine its sched  uled cash flows and thus the bondholder  s expected and actual return      the  legal regulatory and tax considerations that apply to the contractual agreement  between the issuer and the bondholders   and     the contingency provisions  that may affect the bond s scheduled cash flows      The basic features of a bond include the issuer maturity par value  or princi  pal  coupon rate and frequency and currency denomination     Issuers of bonds include supranational organizations  sovereign governments   non  sovereign governments  quasi  government entities  and corporate issuers      Bondholders are exposed to credit risk and may use bond credit ratings to  assess the credit quality of a bond     A bond s principal is the amount the issuer agrees to pay the bondholder when  the bond matures      The coupon rate is the interest rate that the issuer agrees to pay to the bond  holder each year  The coupon rate can be a fixed rate or a floating rate  Bonds  may offer annual semi  annual quarterly or monthly coupon payments depend  ing on the type of bond and where the bond is issued     Bonds can be issued in any currency  Bonds such as dual  currency bonds and  currency option bonds are connected to two currencies      The yield to maturity is the discount rate that equates the present value of the  bond s future cash flows until maturity to its price  Yield to maturity can be con  sidered an estimate of the market s expectation for the bond s return     A plain vanilla bond has a known cash flow pattern  It has a fixed maturity date  and pays a fixed rate of interest over the bond s life     The bond indenture or trust deed is the legal contract that describes the form  of the bond the issuer  s obligations  and the investor  s rights   The indenture is  usually held by a financial institution called a trustee which performs various  duties specified in the indenture     The issuer is identified in the indenture by its legal name and is obligated to  make timely payments of interest and repayment of principal     For asset  backed securities  the legal obligation to repay bondholders often lies  with a separate legal entity that is  a bankruptcy  remote vehicle that uses the  assets as guarantees to back a bond issue     How the issuer intends to service the debt and repay the principal should be  described in the indenture  The source of repayment proceeds varies depending  on the type of bond     Collateral backing is a way to alleviate credit risk   Secured bonds are backed  by assets or financial guarantees pledged to ensure debt payment   Examples of  collateral  backed bonds include collateral trust bonds  equipment trust certifi  cates  mortgage  backed securities  and covered bonds

4,354,  A is correct   The tenor of the bond is the time remaining until the bond s matu  rity date  Although the bond had a maturity of    years at issuance  original  maturity  it was issued four years ago  Thus  there are six years remaining until  the maturity date  B is incorrect because the nominal rate is the coupon rate i e  the interest rate  that the issuer agrees to pay each year until the maturity date  Although interest  is paid semi  annually the nominal rate is     not     C is incorrect because  it is the bond s price not its redemption value  also called principal amount   principal value par value face value nominal value or maturity value  that is  equal to      of the par value    C is correct   A capital market security has an original maturity longer than one  year   A is incorrect because a perpetual bond does not have a stated maturity date   Thus  the sovereign bond which has a maturity of    years  cannot be a perpet  ual bond  B is incorrect because a pure discount bond is a bond issued at a dis  count to par value and redeemed at par  Some sovereign bonds  e g   Treasury  bills  are pure discount bonds  but others are not     C is correct   The coupon rate that applies to the interest payment due on     June is based on the three  month Libor rate prevailing on    March  Thus  the  coupon rate is                          B is correct   The indenture also referred to as trust deed is the legal contract  that describes the form of the bond the obligations of the issuer and the rights  of the bondholders    A is incorrect because covenants are only one element of a bond s indenture   Covenants are clauses that specify the rights of the bondholders and any actions  that the issuer is obligated to perform or prohibited from performing   C is  incorrect because a debenture is a type of bond     B is correct   A surety bond is an external credit enhancement  i e  a guarantee  received from a third party  If the issuer defaults  the guarantor who provided  the surety bond will reimburse investors for any losses  usually up to a maxi  mum amount called the penal sum   A is incorrect because covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers  and lenders agree upon when the bond is issued  C is incorrect because over  collateralization is an internal not external credit enhancement   Collateral is  a guarantee underlying the debt above and beyond the issuer  s promise to pay  and overcollateralization refers to the process of posting more collateral than  is needed to obtain or secure financing   Collateral such as assets or securities  pledged to ensure debt payments  is not provided by a third party  Thus  over  collateralization is not an external credit enhancement     B is correct   Affirmative  or positive  covenants enumerate what issuers are  required to do and are typically administrative in nature  A common affirmative  covenant describes what the issuer intends to do with the proceeds from the  bond issue   A and C are incorrect because imposing a limit on the issuer  s leverage ratio  or on the percentage of the issuer  s gross assets that can be sold are negative  covenants   Negative covenants prevent the issuer from taking actions that could  reduce its ability to make interest payments and repay the principal

5,359,OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL FIXED  INCOME MARKETS
6,359,Although there is no standard classification of fixed  income markets  many investors  and market participants use criteria to structure fixed  income markets and identify  bond market sectors   This section starts by describing the most widely used ways of  classifying fixed  income markets  
7,359,    Classification of Fixed  Income Markets
8,359,Common criteria used to classify fixed  income markets include the type of issuer    the bonds  credit quality maturity currency denomination and type of coupon  and  where the bonds are issued and traded 
9,359,      Classification by Type of Issuer
10,359,One way of classifying fixed  income markets is by type of issuer which usually leads  to the identification of three bond market sectors   the government and government   related sector the corporate sector and the structured finance sector  The government

3,360,and government  related sector includes the bonds issued by supranational  interna  tional  organizations  such as the World Bank   sovereign  national  governments    non  sovereign  local  governments  such as provinces  regions  states  or cities   and  quasi  government entities that are either owned or sponsored by governments  such  as rail services or utilities in many countries   The corporate sector refers to the bonds  issued by financial and non  financial companies   The structured finance sector includes  bonds created by securitization a process that transforms private transactions between  borrowers and lenders into securities traded in public markets    Exhibit    presents data on global capital markets at the end of December         As mentioned in the introduction the combined sectors of the global debt markets  are three times larger than the global equity markets   Exhibit    also indicates that  the largest issuers of bonds are governments and financial institutions   However the  last column shows that in the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis that  started in      the amount of bonds issued by governments increased whereas the  amount of bonds issued by financial institutions decreased  In addition the last two  columns of Exhibit   show that the sector that grew the fastest between      and       was securitized debt instruments  but it was also the sector that shrank the most after        Securitized debt instruments  also called asset  backed securities  are created  by securitization  Securitization involves transferring ownership of assets from the  original owners into a special legal entity  The special legal entity then issues securities  backed by the assets  and the assets  cash flows are used to pay interest and repay the  principal owed to the holders of the securities   Assets that are typically used to create  securitized debt instruments include loans  such as mortgage loans  and receivables   such as credit card receivables   Securitized debt instruments are not discussed in  this reading but rather in the reading on asset  backed securities   The last row is a reminder that although the focus of many market participants  and this reading is on publicly traded securities  bank loans remain an important  component of global capital markets   In many countries  bank loans are the primary  source of capital particularly for small and medium  size companies

51,361,      Classification by Credit Quality
52,361,Investors who hold bonds are exposed to credit risk  which is the risk of loss resulting  from the issuer failing to make full and timely payments of interest and or principal   Bond markets can be classified based on the issuer  s creditworthiness as judged by credit  rating agencies   Ratings of Baa  or above by Moody  s Investors Service or BBB  or  above by Standard   Poor  s  S P  and Fitch Ratings are considered investment grade   In contrast  ratings below these levels are referred to as non  investment grade high  yield speculative or  junk    An important point to understand is that credit ratings  are an assessment of the issuer  s creditworthiness at a certain point in time  they are  not a recommendation to buy or sell the issuer  s securities   In addition credit ratings  are not static  they will change if a credit rating agency perceives that the probability  of default for an issuer has changed  One of the reasons why the distinction between investment  grade and high  yield  bond markets matters is because institutional investors may be prohibited from  investing in or restricted in their exposure to lower  quality or lower  rated securities    Prohibition or restriction in high  yield bond holdings generally arise because of a more  restrictive risk reward profile that forms part of the investor  s investment objectives  and constraints   For example regulated banks and life insurance companies are usually

4,362,      Classification by Maturity
5,362,Fixed  income securities can also be classified by the original maturity of the bonds  when they are issued  Securities that are issued with a maturity at issuance  original  maturity  ranging from overnight to one year are money market securities   Some  of these securities are issued by sovereign governments  such as Treasury bills   The  corporate sector also issues fixed  income securities with short maturities   Examples  include commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit  which are discussed  in Sections     and       respectively  In contrast  capital market securities are secu  rities that are issued with an original maturity longer than one year 
6,362,      Classification by Currency Denomination
7,362,One of the critical ways to distinguish among fixed  income securities is by currency  denomination  The currency denomination of the bond s cash flows influences which  interest rates affect a bond s price  For example if a bond is denominated in yen  its price will be primarily driven by the credit quality of the issuer and by Japanese  interest rates   Exhibit    presents data on the currency denomination of international bonds   which are bonds issued by entities outside their home market either in their domestic  currency or in a foreign currency  It shows that approximately     of international  bonds are denominated either in Euros or in US dollars

3,363,      Classification by Type of Coupon
4,363,Another way of classifying fixed  income markets is by type of coupon  Some bonds pay  a fixed rate of interest   others  called floating  rate bonds  floating  rate notes  FRNs   or floaters  pay a rate of interest that adjusts to market interest rates at regular short   term intervals  e g   quarterly  
5,363,        Demand and Supply of Fixed  Rate vs  Floating  Rate Debt Balance sheet risk
6,363,management considerations explain much of the demand and supply of floating  rate  debt  For instance the funding of banks that is  the money banks raise to make loans  to companies and individuals is often short term and issued at rates that change or  reset frequently  When there is a mismatch between the interest paid on the liabilities   money the bank borrowed  and the interest received on the assets  money the bank lent  or invested  banks are exposed to interest rate risk that is  the risk associated with a  change in interest rate  In an effort to limit the volatility of their net worth resulting from  interest rate risk  banks that issue floating  rate debt often prefer to make floating  rate  loans and invest in floating  rate bonds or in other adjustable  rate assets   In addition  to institutions with short  term funding needs  demand for floating  rate bonds comes  from investors who believe that interest rates will rise  In that case investors will benefit  from holding floating  rate investments compared with fixed  rate ones   On the supply side issuance of floating  rate debt comes from institutions needing  to finance short  term loans  such as consumer finance companies   Corporate borrowers  also view floating  rate bonds as an alternative to using bank liquidity facilities  e g    lines of credit  particularly when they are a lower cost option and as an alternative  to borrowing long  term at fixed rates when they expect interest rates will fall          Reference Rates The coupon rate of a floating rate bond is typically expressed  as a reference rate plus a spread or margin  The spread is usually set when the bond  is issued and remains constant until maturity  It is primarily a function of the issuer  s  credit risk at issuance  the lower the issuer  s credit quality  the higher its credit risk   the higher the spread  The reference rate however resets periodically  Therefore the  coupon rate adjusts to the level of market interest rates each time the reference rate is  reset  The choice of the reference rate is critical because the reference rate is the primary  driver of a bond s coupon rate  Thus  the issuer  s cost of financing and the investor  s  return from investing in the bonds depend on the reference rate  Different reference rates are used depending on where the bonds are issued and  their currency denomination  The London interbank offered rate  Libor  is the ref  erence rate for many floating  rate bonds  in particular those issued in the Eurobond  market  For example a typical coupon rate for a floater denominated in British sterling  that pays coupons semi  annually is the sterling six  month Libor plus a spread  The  coupon rate that is paid at the end of a six  month period is set based on the sterling  six  month Libor at the beginning of the period and it remains constant throughout  the six months   Every six months  the coupon rate is reset in line with the sterling  six  month Libor prevailing on the reset date  For floating  rate bonds denominated  in US dollars  the reference rate is usually the US dollar Libor the US dollar three   month Libor if the coupons are paid quarterly or the US dollar     month Libor if the  coupons are paid annually  As illustrated in these examples   Libor  is a collective name for multiple rates    Libor rates reflect the rates at which a panel of banks believe they could borrow unse  cured funds from other banks in the London interbank money market for different  currencies and different borrowing periods ranging from overnight to one year the  interbank money market or interbank market is the market of loans and deposits  between banks for maturities up to one year  The sidebar describes how the Libor  rates are determined and identifies some of the issues associated with Libor

3,364,Administration of Libor
4,364,As of the time of this writing in late      the process by which Libor rates are set is in  transition  Historically Libor rates were set by the British Bankers  Association  BBA   Every  business day a select group of    banks would submit to the BBA the rates at which  they believed they could borrow from other banks in the London interbank market for     currencies and    borrowing periods   The submitted rates would be ranked from  highest to lowest and the upper and lower four submissions would be discarded  The  arithmetic mean of the remaining    rates became the Libor rates for a par ticular com   bination of currency and maturity  The     Libor rates would then be communicated to  market par ticipants for use as reference rates in many different types of debt including  floating  rate bonds  One of the advantages of Libor has been its prevalence of use  The shor tcoming of  Libor as historically set was that Libor rates were not based on readily observable market  rates but on banks  own estimates of their borrowing rates  Because the rates at which  a bank can borrow money are an indication of its credit risk  banks had an incentive to  understate their reported borrowing rates  A scandal emerged in      as it was recognized  that at times Libor rates drif ted away from the underlying reality  How the Libor rates  are set will cer tainly evolve going forward  In September       the Financial Services  Authority  FSA  at that time the regulator of all the providers of financial services in the  United Kingdom announced that the BBA would be relieved of oversight of Libor   It is  also possible that over time market rates may emerge as an alternative way of setting  Libor and other reference rates 
5,364,Although there are Libor rates for currencies such as the euro and the yen  alternative interbank offered rates may be used for floating  rate debt issued in these  currencies  such as the Euro interbank offered rate  Euribor  and the Tokyo interbank  offered rate  Tibor  respectively  Similar sets of interbank offered rates exist in other  markets  for instance the Singapore interbank offered rate  Sibor  the Hong Kong  interbank offered rate  Hibor  the Mumbai interbank offered rate  Mibor  or the  Korea interbank offered rate  Koribor  for floating  rate debt issued in Singapore dollar  Hong Kong dollar Indian rupee or the Korean won respectively  All these different  interbank offered rates are sets of rates for borrowing periods of various maturities  of up to one year  The processes to determine them are similar except that the sets  of banks and organizations fixing the daily rates are different   The use of these interbank offered rates extends beyond setting coupon rates for  floating  rate debt   These rates are also used as reference rates for other debt instru  ments including mortgages  derivatives such as interest rate and currency swaps  and  many other financial contracts and products   As of November       it is estimated  that nearly      trillion of financial instruments are tied to Libor 
6,364,  The question asked is   At what rate could you borrow funds  were you to do so by asking for and then  accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to   am   Since Libor was established  in      the number of currencies has increased from three to    and the number of periods has also  increased from    to    resulting in     rates as of       But the number of rates is likely to go down in       with the elimination of some of the currencies and maturities     In      the Financial Services Authority  FSA  was replaced by two new regulatory authorities  the  Prudential Regulation Authority  PRA  responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of  the banking system and the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA  the regulator for all other providers of  financial services

3,365,      Classification by Geography
4,365,A distinction is very often made between the domestic bond foreign bond and  Eurobond markets   Bonds issued in a specific country denominated in the currency  of that country and sold in that country are classified as domestic bonds if they are  issued by an issuer domiciled in that country and foreign bonds if they are issued by  an issuer domiciled in another country  Domestic and foreign bonds are subject to  the legal regulatory and tax requirements that apply in that particular country  In  contrast  a Eurobond is issued internationally outside the jurisdiction of the country  in whose currency the bond is denominated  The Eurobond market has traditionally  been characterized by less reporting  regulatory and tax constraints than domestic  and foreign bond markets   These fewer constraints explain why approximately      of entities that issue bonds outside their country of origin choose to do so in the  Eurobond market rather than in a foreign bond market   In addition Eurobonds are  attractive for issuers because it gives them the ability to reach out to more investors  globally  Access to a wider pool of investors often allows issuers to raise more capital  and usually at a lower cost   Exhibit   presents data on the residence of issuers and a breakdown of the amount  of bonds outstanding between the government  financial and non  financial sectors    It shows that     of issuers are located in the United States and Japan and that the  residents of    countries account for     of the global bond markets   Exhibit   also  indicates that the split between the three sectors varies among countries   For example  the government sector represents     of the amount of bonds outstanding in Japan  but non  financial corporate issuers only account for    of the       trillion of bonds  outstanding   In contrast  the corporate sector is the largest sector in countries such  as the Netherlands  Spain the United Kingdom or the United States  although the  majority of bonds are issued by financial rather than non  financial companies

3,366,Investors make a distinction between countries with established capital markets   developed markets  and countries where the capital markets are in earlier stages of  development  emerging markets   For emerging bond markets  a further distinction is  made between bonds issued in local currency and bonds issued in a foreign currency  such as the euro or the US dollar  Emerging bond markets are much smaller than developed bond markets  which  is the reason why they do not appear in Exhibit     But as demand from local and  international investors has increased issuance and trading of emerging market bonds  have risen in volume and value  International investors  interest in emerging market  bonds has been triggered by a desire to diversify risk across several jurisdictions in the  belief that investment returns across markets are not closely correlated  In addition  emerging market bonds usually offer higher yields  return  than developed market  bonds because of the higher perceived risk   Emerging countries typically lag developed  countries in the areas of political stability property rights  and contract enforcement   which often leads to a higher credit risk and higher yields   Many emerging countries   however are less indebted than their developed counterparts and benefit from higher  growth prospects  which appeals to many investors  
4,366,      Other Classifications of Fixed  Income Markets
5,366,There are various other ways of classifying fixed  income markets   Market participants  may classify fixed  income markets based on some specific characteristics associ  ated with the fixed  income securities   Specific market sectors that are of interest  to some investors are inflation  linked bonds and in some jurisdictions  tax  exempt  bonds   Issuance of either type of bond tends to be limited to certain types of issuers    Inflation  linked bonds or linkers are typically issued by governments  government   related entities  and corporate issuers that have an investment  grade rating   They  offer investors protection against inflation by linking the coupon payment and or the  principal repayment to an index of consumer prices   Tax  exempt bonds can only be issued in those jurisdictions that recognize such  tax exemption  In the United States for example there is an income tax exemption  for some of the bonds issued by governments or by some non  profit organizations    In particular local governments can issue municipal bonds  or munis  that are tax  exempt  they can also issue taxable municipal bonds  although tax  exempt munis  are more frequently issued than taxable munis   Tax  exempt municipal bonds are of  interest to investors who are subject to income tax because the interest income on  these bonds is typically exempt from federal income tax and from income tax of the  state where the bonds are issued subject to certain restrictions   The coupon rate on a  tax  exempt municipal bond is typically lower than that on an otherwise similar taxable  bond to reflect the implied income tax rate  Investors are willing to accept a lower  coupon rate on a tax  exempt municipal bond compared with an otherwise similar  taxable bond because the income received from municipal bonds is not taxable  Tax   exempt bonds also exist in other jurisdictions   For example the National Highways  Authority of India  NHAI  issues tax  exempt bonds   In countries that implement a  capital gains tax  there may be tax exemptions for some types of bonds   In the United  Kingdom for example government gilts are not subject to capital gains tax

9,368,    Fixed  Income Indexes
10,368,A fixed  income index is a multi  purpose tool used by investors and investment man  agers to describe a given bond market or sector as well as to evaluate the performance  of investments and investment managers   Most fixed  income indexes are constructed  as portfolios of securities that reflect a particular bond market or sector  The index  construction that is  the security selection and the index weighting varies among  indexes    Index weighting may be based on price or value  market capitalization   There are literally dozens of fixed  income indexes globally capturing different  aspects of the fixed  income markets discussed earlier  One of the most popular set  of indexes is the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index  which represents  a broad  based measure of the global investment  grade fixed  rate bond market   It has  an index history beginning on   January      and contains three important compo  nents   the US Aggregate Bond Index  formerly Lehman Aggregate Bond Index  the  Pan  European Aggregate Bond Index  and the Asian  Pacific Aggregate Bond Index    These indexes reflect the investment  grade sectors of the US European and Asian   Pacific bond markets  respectively  With respect to emerging markets  one of the most widely followed indexes is the  J P  Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index  EMBI  Global which includes US dollar   denominated Brady bonds  bonds issued primarily by Latin American countries in  the late     s under a debt restructuring plan aimed at converting bank loans into  tradable securities  Eurobonds and loans issued by sovereign and quasi  sovereign  entities in several emerging markets   Another popular set of indexes is the FTSE Global Bond Index Series  which has  been set up to provide coverage of different classes of securities related to the govern  ment and corporate bond markets   It includes indexes of global government bonds   euro  denominated government bonds from emerging markets  sterling  and euro   denominated investment  grade corporate bonds  and covered bonds from Germany  and other European Union issuers   Covered bonds are debt obligations issued by  banks and backed  secured  by a segregated pool of assets

4,369,    Investors in Fixed  Income Securities
5,369,The overview of fixed  income markets has so far focused on the supply side  Before  discussing bond issuers in greater detail it is important to consider the demand side  because demand for a particular type of bond or issuer may affect supply  After all  market prices are the result of the interaction between demand and supply   neither  one can be considered in isolation  For example an increase in demand for inflation   linked bonds as a result of investors  desire to protect the value of their portfolios  against inflation risk may lead governments to issue a greater quantity of this type of  bond  By issuing relatively more inflation  linked bonds for which there is demand a  government not only manages to sell its bond issue and get the funds required but  it may also benefit from a lower cost of financing   There are different types of investors in fixed  income securities   Major categories  of bond investors include central banks  institutional investors  and retail investors    The first two typically invest directly in fixed  income securities   In contrast  retail  investors often invest indirectly through fixed  income mutual funds or exchange   traded funds  ETFs   Central banks use open market operations to implement monetary policy  Open  market operations refer to the purchase or sale of bonds  usually sovereign bonds  issued by the national government   By purchasing  selling  domestic bonds  central  banks increase  decrease  the monetary base in the economy  Central banks may also  purchase and sell bonds denominated in foreign currencies as part of their efforts to  manage the relative value of the domestic currency and their country  s foreign reserves   Institutional investors  including pension funds  hedge funds  charitable foundations  and endowments  insurance companies  and banks  represent the largest groups of  investors in fixed  income securities   Another major group of investors is sovereign  wealth funds  which are state  owned investment funds that tend to have very long  investment horizons and aim to preserve or create wealth for future generations   Finally retail investors often invest heavily in fixed  income securities because of  the attractiveness of relatively stable prices and steady income production  Fixed  income markets are dominated by institutional investors in part because of  the high informational barriers to entry and high minimum transaction sizes   Fixed   income securities are far more diverse than equity securities because of the variety of  types of issuers and securities   In addition unlike common shares that are primarily  issued and traded in organized markets  the issuance and trading of bonds very often  occurs in over  the   counter  OTC  markets  Thus  fixed  income securities are more  difficult to access than equity securities   For these reasons  institutional investors tend  to invest directly in bonds  whereas most retail investors prefer to use investment  vehicles  such as mutual funds and ETFs

2,370,   
3,370,  Retail investors most often  A do not invest in fixed  income securities   B  invest directly in fixed  income securities   C  invest indirectly in fixed  income securities through mutual funds or  exchange  traded funds  
4,370,Solution to   
5,370,B is correct   Open market operations refer to the purchase or sale of bonds   usually sovereign bonds issued by the national government as a means of imple  menting monetary policy  By purchasing  selling  bonds  central banks increase   decrease  the monetary base in the economy thus controlling the money supply   A is incorrect because open market operations help facilitate monetary policy  not fiscal policy  which is the taxing and spending by the national government    C is incorrect because although Treasury departments and some central banks  may facilitate the issuance and repayment of government debt  open market  operations specifically refer to the implementation of monetary policy 
6,370,Solution to   
7,370,C is correct   Retail investors often invest in fixed  income securities because  of the attractiveness of relatively stable prices and steady income production   However because most retail investors lack the expertise to value fixed  income  securities and are not large enough investors to buy and sell them directly they  usually invest in fixed income indirectly through mutual funds and exchange   traded funds

9,370,PRIMARY AND SECONDARY BOND MARKETS
10,370,Primary bond markets are markets in which issuers initially sell bonds to investors  to raise capital  In contrast  secondary bond markets are markets in which existing  bonds are subsequently traded among investors   As with all financial markets  primary  and secondary bond markets are regulated within the framework of the overall finan  cial system  An established independent regulatory authority is usually responsible for  overseeing both the structure of the markets and the credentials of market participants

15,371,In the remainder of this section we discuss the process for issuing bonds in pri  mary markets   Different bond issuing mechanisms are used depending on the type of  issuer and the type of bond issued  A bond issue can be sold via a public offering  or  public offer  in which any member of the public may buy the bonds  or via a private  placement in which only a selected investor or group of investors  may buy the bonds  
16,371,      Public Offerings
17,371,Investment banks play a critical role in bond issuance by assisting the issuer in access  ing the primary market and by providing an array of financial services   The most  common bond issuing mechanisms are underwritten offerings  best effort offerings 
18,371,and auctions   In an underwritten offering also called a firm commitment offering
19,371,the investment bank guarantees the sale of the bond issue at an offering price that is  negotiated with the issuer  Thus  the investment bank  called the underwriter takes  the risk associated with selling the bonds   In contrast  in a best effort offering the  investment bank only serves as a broker  It only tries to sell the bond issue at the  negotiated offering price if it is able to for a commission  Thus  the investment bank  has less risk and correspondingly less incentive to sell the bonds in a best effort  offering than in an underwritten offering   An auction is a bond issuing mechanism  that involves bidding           Underwritten Offerings Underwritten offerings are typical bond issuing  mechanisms for corporate bonds  some local government bonds  such as municipal  bonds in the United States  and some asset  backed securities  such as mortgage  backed  securities   The underwriting process typically includes six phases   The underwriting process starts with the determination of the funding needs    Often with the help of an adviser or advisers  the issuer must determine how much  money must be raised the type of bond offering  and whether the bond issue should  be underwritten 
1,372,Primary and Secondary Bond Markets
2,372,   
3,372,Once the issuer has decided that the bond issue should be underwritten it must  select the underwriter which is typically an investment bank   The underwriter of a  bond issue takes the risk of buying the newly issued bonds from the issuer and then  resells them to investors or to dealers who then sell them to investors   The difference  between the purchase price of the new bond issue and the reselling price to investors  is the underwriter  s revenue  A relatively small  size bond issue may be underwritten  by a single investment bank   It is more common for larger bond issues  however to  be underwritten by a group or syndicate of investment banks   In this case the bond  issue is referred to as a syndicated offering  There is a lead underwriter that invites  other investment banks to join the syndicate and that coordinates the effort   The  syndicate is collectively responsible for determining the pricing of the bond issue and  for placing  selling  the bonds with investors   The third phase of an underwritten offering is to structure the transaction  Before  the bond issue is announced the issuer and the lead underwriter discuss the terms of  the bond issue such as the bond s notional principal  total amount  the coupon rate  and the expected offering price  The underwriter or the syndicate typically organizes  the necessary regulatory filings and prepares the offering circular or prospectus that  provides information about the terms of the bond issue  The issuer must also choose  a trustee which is typically a trust company or the trust department of a bank  to  oversee the master bond agreement   The bond offering is formally launched the day  the transaction is announced usually in the form of a press release  The announcement  specifies the new bond issue s terms and conditions  including the bond s features   such as the maturity date the currency denomination and the expected coupon range  as well as the expected offering price  The issuer also releases the offering circular  or prospectus   The final terms may differ from these terms as a result of changes in  market conditions between the announcement day and the pricing day  The success of the bond issue depends on the underwriter or syndicate s discern  ment in assessing market conditions and in pricing the bond issue accordingly  The  pricing of the bond issue is  therefore an important phase of an underwritten offering    Ideally the bond issue should be priced so that the amount of bonds available is equal to  the demand for the bonds by investors   If the offering price is set too high the offering  will be undersubscribed that is  there will be insufficient demand for the bond issue   As a consequence the underwriter or syndicate will fail to sell the entire bond issue   Alternatively if the offering price is set too low the offering will be oversubscribed   Underwriters may aim at a small oversubscription because it reduces the risk of being  unable to sell the entire bond issue  But a large oversubscription indicates that the  offering terms were probably unfavorable to the issuer in that the issuer might have  raised the desired amount of capital at a lower coupon rate  Between the announcement of a bond issue and the end of the subscription  period the underwriter or syndicate must gauge what the demand for the bond issue  is and at what price the bond should be offered to ensure that the entire bond issue is  placed without running the risk of a large oversubscription  There are different ways  for underwriters to do so  The bond issue is usually marketed to potential investors    This may be by an indirect approach such as an advertisement in a newspaper a  commonly used approach for bond issued by household names  or through direct  marketing and road shows  aimed at institutional investors such as pension funds  and insurance companies   The underwriter or syndicate may also approach large  institutional investors and discuss with them the kind of bond issues they are willing  to buy  These buyers are known as the  anchor   For some but not all bond issues   the grey market is another way for underwriters to gauge investor  s interest   The grey  market also called  when issued  market  is a forward market for bonds about to  be issued  Trading in the grey market helps underwriters determine what the final  offering price should be

3,373,The pricing day is the last day when investors can commit to buy the bond issue  and it is also the day when the final terms of the bond issue are agreed on  The fol  lowing day called the  offering day  the underwriting agreement that includes the  bond issue s final terms is signed  The underwriting process then enters the issuing  phase  The underwriter or the syndicate purchases the entire bond issue from the  issuer delivers the proceeds  and starts reselling the bonds through its sales network   The underwriting process comes to an end about    days later on the closing  day when the bonds are delivered to investors   Investors no longer receive a paper  settlement   instead the bond itself is represented by a global note that is typically  held by the paying agent  
4,373,        Shelf Registration A shelf registration allows certain authorized issuers
5,373,to offer additional bonds to the general public without having to prepare a new and  separate offering circular for each bond issue  Rather the issuer prepares a single  all  encompassing offering circular that describes a range of future bond issuances  all  under the same document  This master prospectus may be in place for years before  it is replaced or updated and it may be used to cover multiple bond issuances   For  example the British retailer Tesco used a shelf registration in      for a series of issues  under a universal aggregate     billion of bonds   The company could have elected to  issue the entire size at once  Instead it has issued smaller notional amounts at different  intervals since       Under a shelf registration each individual offering is prefaced with a short issue  announcement document  This document must confirm that there has been no change  to material elements of the issuer  s business  or otherwise describe any changes to the  issuer  s financial condition since the master prospectus was filed  Because shelf issu  ances are subject to a lower level of scrutiny compared with standard public offerings   they are only an option for well  established issuers that have convinced the regulatory  authorities of their financial strength  Additionally certain jurisdictions may only  allow shelf registrations to be purchased by  qualified  institutional investors that  is  institutional investors that meet a set of criteria set forth by the regulators           Auctions An auction is a method that involves bidding   It is helpful in provid  ing price discovery  i e  it facilitates supply and demand in determining prices  and in  allocating securities  In many countries most sovereign bonds are sold to the public via  a public auction  For example in      the United States conducted     public auctions  and issued approximately       trillion of new securities such as Treasury bills  notes   bonds  and Treasury Inflation  Protected Securities  TIPS   The public auction process  used in the United States is a single  price auction through which all the winning bid  ders pay the same price and receive the same coupon rate for the bonds   In contrast  the public auction process used in Canada and Germany is a multiple  price auction  process  which generates multiple prices and coupon rates for the same bond issue  The US sovereign bond market is one of the largest and most liquid bond markets  globally so we will illustrate the US single  price auction process   This process includes  three phases   announcement bidding  and issuance  First the US Treasury announces  the auction and provides information about the bond issue such as the amount of  securities being offered the auction date the issue date the maturity date bidding  close times  and other pertinent information  After the auction announcement is made dealers  institutional investors  and indi  vidual investors may enter competitive or non  competitive bids   With competitive bids   a bidder specifies the rate  yield  that is considered acceptable  if the rate determined  at auction is lower than the rate specified in the competitive bid the investor will not  be offered any securities   In contrast  with non  competitive bids  a bidder agrees to  accept the rate determined at auction  non  competitive bidders always receive their  securities   At the close of the auction the US Treasury accepts all non  competitive

3,374,bids and competitive bids in ascending order of their rates  lowest to highest  until the  amount of bids is equal to the amount the issuer requires   All bidders receive the same  rate based on the highest accepted bid  This single  price auction process encourages  aggressive bidding and potentially results in a lower cost of funds  i e  lower coupon  rate  for the U S Treasury because all the winning bidders pay the same price  On the issue day the US Treasury delivers the securities to the winning bidders  and collects the proceeds from investors   After the auction process is complete the  securities are traded in secondary markets like other securities   Exhibit   shows the results of a US Treasury public auction

7,375,      Private Placements
8,375,A private placement is typically a non  underwritten unregistered offering of bonds  that are sold only to an investor or a small group of investors   Typical investors in  privately placed bonds are large institutional investors   A private placement can be  accomplished directly between the issuer and the investor s  or through an investment  bank   Because privately placed bonds are unregistered and may be restricted securities  that can only be purchased by some types of investors  there is usually no active second  ary market to trade them  However trading may be possible under certain conditions    For example restricted securities issued under Rule    A in the United Sates cannot  be sold to the public but they can be traded among qualified institutional investors    Even if trading is possible privately placed bonds typically exhibit lower liquidity than  publicly issued bonds   Insurance companies and pension funds are major buyers of  privately placed bonds because they do not need every security in their portfolio to  be liquid and they often value the additional yield offered by these bonds   Private placements sometimes represent a step in the company  s financing evolution  between syndicated loans  loans from a group of lenders to a single borrower further  discussed in Section      and public offerings   Privately placed bonds are often issued  in small aggregate amounts  at times by unknown issuers   Many investors may not be  willing to undertake the credit analysis that is required for a new name in particular if  the offering amount is small  Unlike in a public offering in which the bonds are often  sold to investors on a take  it  or  leave  it basis  investors in a private placement can  influence the structure of the bond issue including such considerations as asset and  collateral backing  credit enhancements  and covenants   It is common for privately  placed bonds to have more customized and restrictive covenants than publicly issued  ones   In addition to being able to negotiate the terms of the bonds and align them

3,376,with their needs  investors in private placements are rewarded by getting the bonds   which is not always the case in public offerings in which investors cannot know for sure  when the issue will become available and how many securities they will be allocated  Private placements are also offered by regular bond issuers  in particular for smaller  amounts of capital raised in major currencies  such as US dollars  euros  or sterling    Private placements are usually more flexible than public offerings and allow regular  issuers to tailor the bond issue to their own needs  
4,376,    Secondary Bond Markets
5,376,Secondary markets  also called the  aftermarket   are where existing securities are  traded among investors   Securities can be traded directly from investor to investor  or through a broker or dealer to facilitate the transaction  The major participants in  secondary bond markets globally are large institutional investors and central banks    The presence of retail investors in secondary bonds markets is limited unlike in  secondary equity markets   The key to understanding how secondary bond markets are structured and  function is to understand liquidity  Liquidity refers to the ability to trade  buy or  sell  securities quickly and easily at prices close to their fair market value  Liquidity  involves much more than  how quickly one can turn a bond into cash   This statement  implicitly assumes a long position but some market participants need to buy quickly  when covering a short position  The other aspect of liquidity that is often ignored is  that speed of trading alone does not constitute a liquid market   One can always buy  something quickly by offering a very high price or sell something quickly by accepting  a very low price  In a liquid market  trading takes place quickly at prices close to the  security  s fair market value  There are two main ways for secondary markets to be structured  as an organized  exchange or as an over  the  counter market  An organized exchange provides a place  where buyers and sellers can meet to arrange their trades   Although buy or sell orders  may come from anywhere the transaction must take place at the exchange accord  ing to the rules imposed by the exchange  In contrast  with OTC markets  buy and  sell orders initiated from various locations are matched through a communications  network   Thus  OTC markets need electronic trading platforms over which users  submit buy and sell orders   Bloomberg Fixed Income Electronic Trading platform is  an example of such a platform through which dealers stand ready to trade in multiple  bond markets globally  Although there is some trading of government bonds and very  active corporate bonds on many stock exchanges around the world the vast majority  of bonds are traded in OTC markets   The liquidity demands of fixed  income investors have evolved since the early      s   The type of investors who would buy and hold a bond to maturity that once  dominated the fixed  income markets has been supplanted by institutional investors  who trade actively  The dynamics of global fixed  income markets reflect this change  in the relative demand for liquidity  We will illustrate how secondary markets work by using the example of Eurobonds    The most important Eurobond trading center by volume is in London although a  large number of market participants are also based in Brussels  Frankfurt  Zurich and  Singapore  Liquidity is supplied by Eurobond market makers  of which approximately     are registered with the International Capital Market Association  ICMA   ICMA  is an association of banks and other financial institutions that provides a regulatory  framework for international bond markets and that is behind much of the established  uniform practices that are observed by all market participants in the Eurobond market  The level of commitment to the different sectors of the market varies among  market makers   The bid offer spread or bid ask spread which reflects the prices  at which dealers will buy from a customer  bid  and sell to a customer  offer or ask

3,377,is very often used as an indicator of liquidity  It can be as low as   bps for very liquid  bond issues  such as issues of the World Bank  to no price quoted for illiquid issues    A reasonable spread is of the order of       bps  whereas an illiquid spread may be  in excess of    bps   When there is no bid or offer price the issue is completely illiquid  for trading purposes   Settlement is the process that occurs after the trade is made  The bonds are passed  to the buyer and payment is received by the seller  Secondary market settlement for  government and quasi  government bonds typically takes place either on a cash basis  or on a T     basis   With cash settlement  trading and settlement occur on the same  day  With T     settlement  settlement takes place the day after the trade date  In  contrast  corporate bonds usually settle on a T     or T     basis  although settlement  can extend to T     in some jurisdictions   Trades clear within either or both of the  two main clearing systems  Euroclear and Clearstream  Settlement occurs by means  of a simultaneous exchange of bonds for cash on the books of the clearing system   An electronic bridge connecting Euroclear and Clearstream allows transfer of bonds  from one system to the other so it is not necessary to have accounts at both systems    Both systems operate on a paperless  computerized book  entry basis  although a bond  issue is still represented by a physical document  the global note mentioned earlier   All participants in either system will have their own internal account set up and they  may also act as agent for buyers or sellers who do not possess an account

2,378,Sovereign Bonds
3,378,Solution to   
4,378,A is correct   Primary bond markets are markets in which bonds are issued for  the first time to raise capital  B is incorrect because having a specific location  where the trading of bonds takes place is not a requirement for a primary bond  market  C is incorrect because a market in which existing bonds are traded among  individuals and institutions is the definition of a secondary not primary market 
5,378,Solution to   
6,378,A is correct   US Treasury bonds are typically sold to the public via an auction   B is incorrect because primary dealers are often bidders in the auction  they are  financial institutions that are active in trading US Treasury bonds   C is incorrect  because any bond issue coming directly to the market is considered to be in the  primary not the secondary market  
7,378,Solution to   
8,378,A is correct   In a single  price bond auction a bidder that enters a competitive  bid specifies the rate  yield  that is considered acceptable  If the rate specified in  the competitive bid is above the coupon rate determined at auction the investor  will not be offered any securities  
9,378,Solution to   
10,378,C is correct   Secondary bond markets are where bonds are traded among  investors   A and B are incorrect because a bond purchased from the bond s  issuer or from the bond s lead underwriter would happen in the primary not  secondary market  
11,378,Solution to   
12,378,C is correct   Corporate bonds typically settle on a T     or T     basis that  is  two or three days after the trade date although settlement can extend to T      in some jurisdictions   A and B are incorrect because it is government and  quasi  government bonds  not corporate bonds  that typically settle either on a  cash basis or on a T     basis

14,378,SOVEREIGN BONDS
15,378,National governments issue bonds primarily for fiscal reasons to fund spending  when tax revenues are insufficient to cover expenditures   To meet their spending  goals  national governments issue bonds in various types and amounts   This section  discusses bonds issued by national governments  often referred to as sovereign
16,378,bonds or sovereigns 
17,378,    Characteristics of Sovereign Bonds
18,378,Sovereign bonds denominated in local currency have different names in different  countries   For example they are named US Treasuries in the United States  Japanese  government bonds   JGBs  in Japan gilts in the United Kingdom Bunds in Germany  and obligations assimilables du Tr sor  OATs  in France  Some investors or market  participants may refer to sovereign bonds as Treasury securities or Treasuries for  short  on the principle that the national Treasury department is often in charge of  managing a national government s funding needs  
1,379,   
2,379,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,379,Names may also vary depending on the original maturity of the sovereign bond  For  example US government bonds are named Treasury bills  T  bills  when the original  maturity is one year or shorter Treasury notes  T  notes  when the original maturity  is longer than one year and up to    years  and Treasury bonds  T  bonds  when the  original maturity is longer than    years   in Spain the sovereigns issued by Tesoro  P blico are named letras del Tesoro bonos del Estado and obligaciones del Estado  depending on the sovereign s original maturity one year or shorter longer than one  year and up to five years  or longer than five years  respectively  Although very rare  some bonds  such as the consols in the United Kingdom have no stated maturity date  The majority of the trading in secondary markets is of sovereign securities that  were most recently issued  These securities are called on  the  run  The latest sovereign  bond issue for a given maturity is also referred to as a benchmark issue because it  serves as a benchmark against which to compare bonds that have the same features   i e  maturity coupon type and frequency and currency denomination  but that are  issued by another type of issuer  e g   non  sovereign corporate   As a general rule as  sovereign securities age they trade less frequently  One salient difference between money market securities  such as T  bills  and  capital market securities  such as T  notes and T  bonds  is the interest provision  As  illustrated in Exhibit   T  bills are pure discount bonds   they are issued at a discount  to par value and redeemed at par  The difference between the par value and the issue  price is the interest paid on the borrowing   In contrast  capital market securities are  typically coupon  or coupon  bearing  bonds   these securities make regular coupon  payments and repay the par value at maturity  Bunds pay coupons annually whereas  US Treasuries  JGBs  gilts  and OATs make semi  annual coupon payments  
4,379,    Credit Quality of Sovereign Bonds
5,379,Sovereign bonds are usually unsecured obligations of the sovereign issuer that is  they  are not backed by collateral but by the taxing authority of the national government    When a national government runs a budget surplus  excess tax revenues over expen  ditures is the primary source of funds for making interest payments and repaying the  principal  In contrast  when a country runs a budget deficit  the source of the funds  used for the payment of interest and repayment of principal comes from tax revenues  and also by  rolling over   refinancing  existing debt into new debt   Highly rated sovereign bonds denominated in local currency are virtually free of  credit risk   Credit rating agencies assign ratings to sovereign bonds  and these rat  ings are called  sovereign ratings    The highest rating  i e  highest credit quality and  lowest credit risk  is AAA by S P and Fitch and Aaa by Moody  s   As of late       only a handful of sovereign issuers were rated at this  theoretically  risk  free level by  these three credit rating agencies  including Germany Singapore Switzerland the  Netherlands  and the United Kingdom  The global financial crisis that started in       resulted in many national governments reaching potentially unsustainable levels of  debt  with the pace of spending far exceeding tax revenues   Many of these national  governments suffered downgrades from the AAA Aaa level including Ireland in       Spain in      and the United States  which was downgraded by S P in       Credit rating agencies make a distinction between bonds issued in the sovereign s  local currency and bonds issued in a foreign currency  In theory a government can  make interest payments and repay the principal by generating cash flows from its  unlimited power  in the short run at least  to tax its citizens   A national government  also has the ability to print its own currency whereas it is restricted in being able to  pay in a foreign currency only what it earns in exports or can exchange in financial  markets   Thus  it is common to observe a higher credit rating for sovereign bonds  issued in local currency than for those issued in a foreign currency  But there are  limits to a government s ability to reduce the debt burden  As the sovereign debt crisis
1,380,Sovereign Bonds
2,380,   
3,380,that followed the global financial crisis has shown taxing citizens can only go so far  in paying down debt before the taxation becomes an economic burden  Additionally  printing money only serves to weaken a country  s currency relative to other curren  cies over time  The national government of a country that has a strong domestic savings base has  the luxury of being able to issue bonds in its local currency and sell them to domestic  investors   If the local currency is liquid and freely traded the sovereign issuer may  also attract foreign investors who may want to hold that sovereign issuer  s bonds and  have exposure to that country  s local currency  A national government may also issue  debt in a foreign currency when there is demand for the sovereign issuer  s bonds  but  not necessarily in the sovereign s local currency  For example demand from overseas  investors has caused national governments such as Switzerland and Sweden to issue  sovereign bonds in US dollars and euros   Emerging market countries may also have  to issue in major currencies because international investors may be willing to accept  the credit risk but not the foreign exchange  currency  risk associated with emerging  market bonds   When a sovereign issuer raises debt in a foreign currency it usually  swaps the proceeds into its local currency 
4,380,    Types of Sovereign Bonds
5,380,National governments issue different types of bonds  some of them paying a fixed  rate of interest and others paying a floating rate including inflation  linked bonds  
6,380,      Fixed  Rate Bonds
7,380,Fixed  rate bonds  i e  bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest  are by far the most  common type of sovereign bond  National governments routinely issue two types of  fixed  rate bonds   zero  coupon bonds  or pure discount bonds  and coupon bonds    A zero  coupon bond does not pay interest   Instead it is issued at a discount to par  value and redeemed at par at maturity  Coupon bonds are issued with a stated rate of  interest and make interest payments periodically such as semi  annually or annually   They have a terminal cash flow equal to the final interest payment plus the par value   As mentioned earlier most sovereign bonds with an original maturity of one year or  less are zero  coupon bonds  whereas bonds with an original maturity longer than one  year are typically issued as coupon bonds  
8,380,      Floating  Rate Bonds
9,380,The price of a bond changes in the opposite direction from the change in interest  rates  a relationship that is fully explained in the reading on understanding the risk  and return of fixed  income securities   Thus  investors who hold fixed  rate bonds are  exposed to interest rate risk   As interest rates increase bond prices decrease which  lowers the value of their portfolio  In response to public demand for less interest rate  risk  some national governments around the world issue bonds with a floating rate  of interest that resets periodically based on changes in the level of a reference rate  such as Libor  Although interest rate risk still exists on floating  rate bonds  it is far  less pronounced than that on fixed  rate bonds   Examples of countries where the national government issues floating  rate bonds  include Germany Spain and Belgium in developed markets and Brazil Turkey Mexico  Indonesia  and Poland in emerging markets   The largest sovereign issuer the United  States  began issuing floating  rate bonds in January       Two other large sovereign  issuers  Japan and the United Kingdom have never issued bonds whose coupon rate  is tied to a reference rate

3,381,      Inflation  Linked Bonds
4,381,Fixed  income investors are exposed to inflation risk   The cash flows of fixed  rate bonds  are fixed by contract   If a particular country experiences an inflationary episode the  purchasing power of the fixed cash flows is eroded over time  Thus  to respond to  the demand for less inflation risk  many national governments issue inflation  linked  bonds  or linkers  whose cash flows are adjusted for inflation  First issuers of inflation   linked bonds were the governments of Argentina  Brazil and Israel  The United  States introduced inflation  linked securities in January       calling them Treasury  Inflation  Protected Securities  TIPS   Other countries where the national government  has issued inflation  linked bonds include the United Kingdom Sweden Australia  and  Canada in developed markets and Brazil South Africa  and Chile in emerging markets   As explained in the reading on fixed  income securities  the index to which the  coupon payments and or principal repayments are linked is typically an index of  consumer prices   Inflation  linked bonds can be structured a variety of ways   The  inflation adjustment can be made via the coupon payments  the principal repay  ment  or both  In the United States  the index used is the Consumer Price Index for  All Urban Consumers  CPI  U   In the United Kingdom it is the Retail Price Index   RPI   All Items   In France there are two inflation  linked bonds with two different  indexes  the French consumer price index  CPI   excluding tobacco  and the Eurozone s  Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices  HICP   excluding tobacco   Although linking  the cash flow payments to a consumer price index reduces inflation risk  it does not  necessarily eliminate the effect of inflation completely because the consumer price  index may be an imperfect proxy for inflation 
5,381,EXAMPLE  
6,381,Sovereign Bonds
7,381,  Sovereign debt with a maturity at issuance shorter than one year are most  likely  A floating  rate instruments   B zero  coupon instruments   C coupon  bearing instruments     Floating  rate bonds are issued by national governments as the best way to  reduce  A credit risk   B  inflation risk   C  interest rate risk     Sovereign bonds whose coupon payments and or principal repayments  are adjusted by a consumer price index are most likely known as   A  linkers   B floaters   C consols  
8,381,Solution to   
9,381,B is correct   Most debt issued by national governments with a maturity at issu  ance  original maturity  shorter than one year takes the form of zero  coupon  instruments   A and C are incorrect because floating  rate and coupon  bearing  instruments are typically types of sovereign debt with maturities longer than  one year 
1,382,Non  Sovereign Government Quasi  Government and Supranational Bonds
2,382,   
3,382,Solution to   
4,382,C is correct  The coupon rates of floating  rate bonds are reset periodically based  on changes in the level of a reference rate such as Libor which reduces interest  rate risk   A is incorrect because credit risk  although low for sovereign bonds   cannot be reduced by linking the coupon rate to a reference rate  B is incorrect  because although inflation risk is lower for floating  rate bonds than for fixed   rate bonds  floating  rate bonds are not as good as inflation  linked bonds to  reduce inflation risk  
5,382,Solution to   
6,382,A is correct because sovereign bonds whose coupon payments and or principal  repayment are adjusted by a consumer price index are known as inflation  linked  bonds or linkers   B is incorrect because floaters describe floating  rate bonds  that have a coupon rate tied to a reference rate such as Libor  C is incorrect  because consols are sovereign bonds with no stated maturity date issued by  the UK government

9,382,This section covers the bonds issued by local governments and by government  related  entities  
10,382,    Non  Sovereign Bonds
11,382,Levels of government below the national level such as provinces  regions  states 
12,382,and cities issue bonds called non  sovereign government bonds or non  sovereign
13,382,bonds  These bonds are typically issued to finance public projects  such as schools   motorways  hospitals  bridges  and airports   The sources for paying interest and  repaying the principal include the taxing authority of the local government  the cash  flows of the project the bond issue is financing  or special taxes and fees established  specifically for the purpose of making interest payments and principal repayments    Non  sovereign bonds are typically not guaranteed by the national government   As mentioned in Section       bonds issued by state and local governments in  the United States are known as municipal bonds  and they often offer income tax  exemptions   In the United Kingdom non  sovereign bonds are known as local authority  bonds   Other non  sovereign bonds include those issued by state authorities such as  the    Lander in Germany  Credit ratings for non  sovereign bonds vary widely because of the differences in  credit and collateral quality  Because default rates of non  sovereign bonds are histor  ically low they very often receive high credit ratings   However non  sovereign bonds  usually trade at a higher yield and lower price than sovereign bonds with similar char  acteristics   The additional yield depends on the credit quality the liquidity of the bond  issue and the implicit or explicit level of guarantee or funding commitment from the  national government   The additional yield is the lowest for non  sovereign bonds that  have high credit quality are liquid and are guaranteed by the national government

3,383,    Quasi  Government Bonds
4,383,National governments establish organizations that perform various functions for them   These organizations often have both public and private sector characteristics  but they  are not actual governmental entities   They are referred to as quasi  government entities   although they take different names in different countries   These quasi  government  entities often issue bonds to fund specific financing needs   These bonds are known
5,383,as quasi  government bonds or agency bonds 
6,383,Examples of quasi  government entities include government  sponsored enterprises   GSEs  in the United States  such as the Federal National Mortgage Association    Fannie Mae   the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation   Freddie Mac    and the Federal Home Loan Bank  FHLB   GSEs were among the largest issuers  of bonds before the global financial crisis that started in       Other examples of  quasi  government entities that issue bonds include Hydro Quebec in Canada or the  Japan Bank for International Cooperation   JBIC   In the case of JBIC  s bonds  timely  payments of interest and repayment of principal are guaranteed by the Japanese gov  ernment   Most quasi  government bonds  however do not offer an explicit guarantee  by the national government  although investors often perceive an implicit guarantee  Because a quasi  government entity typically does not have direct taxing authority  bonds are repaid from the cash flows generated by the entity or from the project the  bond issue is financing   Quasi  government bonds may be backed by collateral but  this is not always the case  Quasi  government bonds are usually rated very high by  the credit rating agencies because historical default rates are extremely low  Bonds  that are guaranteed by the national government receive the highest ratings and trade  at a lower yield and higher price than otherwise similar bonds that are not backed by  the sovereign government s guarantee 
7,383,    Supranational Bonds
8,383,A form of often highly rated bonds is issued by supranational agencies  also referred  to as multilateral agencies   The most well  known supranational agencies are the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  the World Bank  the  International Monetary Fund  IMF  the European Investment Bank  EIB  the Asian  Development Bank  ADB  and the African Development Bank  AFDB   Bonds issued  by supranational agencies are called supranational bonds  Supranational bonds are typically plain vanilla bonds  although floating  rate bonds  and callable bonds are sometimes issued  Highly rated supranational agencies  such  as the World Bank  frequently issue large  size bond issues that are often used as  benchmarks issues when there is no liquid sovereign bond available

11,383,  Relative to sovereign bonds  non  sovereign bonds with similar character  istics most likely trade at a yield that is   A  lower  B  the same  C higher    Bonds issued by a governmental agency are most likely  A  repaid from the cash flows generated by the agency

2,384,   
3,384,B guaranteed by the national government that sponsored the agency  C backed by the taxing power of the national government that sponsored  the agency 
4,384,Solution to   
5,384,C is correct  Non  sovereign bonds usually trade at a higher yield and lower price  than sovereign bonds with similar characteristics   The higher yield is because of  the higher credit risk associated with non  sovereign issuers relative to sovereign  issuers  although default rates of local governments are historically low and  their credit quality is usually high  The higher yield may also be a consequence  of non  sovereign bonds being less liquid than sovereign bonds with similar  characteristics  
6,384,Solution to   
7,384,A is correct   Most bonds issued by a governmental agency are repaid from the  cash flows generated by the agency or from the project the bond issue is financ  ing   B and C are incorrect because although some bonds issued by governmental  agencies are guaranteed by the national government or are backed by the taxing  power of the national government that sponsored the agency bonds are most  likely repaid first from the cash flows generated by the agency 
8,384,CORPORATE DEBT
9,384,Companies differ from governments and government  related entities in that their  primary goal is profit   they must be profitable to stay in existence  Thus  profitability  is an important consideration when companies make decisions  including financing  decisions   Companies routinely raise debt as part of their overall capital structure both  to fund short  term spending needs  e g   working capital  as well as long  term capital  investments   We have so far focused on publicly issued debt  but loans from banks  and other financial institutions are a significant part of the debt raised by companies    For example it is estimated that European companies traditionally meet     of their  borrowing needs from banks and only     from financial markets    However as banks  have been deleveraging and reducing the amount of loans to companies following  the global financial crisis that started in      companies  in particular those with  high credit quality have turned to financial markets to issue bonds   They have been  taking advantage of the low interest rate environment and the increased appetite of  investors for corporate bonds  
10,384,    Bank Loans and Syndicated Loans
11,384,A bilateral loan is a loan from a single lender to a single borrower  Companies rou  tinely use bilateral loans from their banks  and these bank loans are governed by the  bank loan documents   Bank loans are the primary source of debt financing for small  and medium  size companies as well as for large companies in countries where bond  markets are either under  developed or where most bond issuances are from govern  ment  government  related entities  and financial institutions   Access to bank loans  depends not only on the characteristics and financial health of the company but also  on market conditions and bank capital availability

3,385,A syndicated loan is a loan from a group of lenders  called the  syndicate  to a  single borrower  A syndicated loan is a hybrid between relational lending and publicly  traded debt   Syndicated loans are primarily originated by banks  and the loans are  extended to companies but also to governments and government  related entities   The  coordinator or lead bank  originates the loan forms the syndicate and processes the  payments   In addition to banks  a variety of lenders participate in the syndicate such  as pension funds  insurance companies  and hedge funds   Syndicated loans are a way  for these institutional investors to participate in corporate lending while diversifying  the credit risk among a group of lenders   In recent years  a secondary market in syndicated loans has developed  These  loans are often packaged and securitized and the securities created are then sold in  secondary markets to investors   Most bilateral and syndicated loans are floating  rate loans  and the interest rate  is based on a reference rate plus a spread  The reference rate may be Libor a sover  eign rate  e g   the T  bill rate  or the prime lending rate also called the  prime rate    The prime rate formerly reflected the interest rate at which banks lent to their most  creditworthy customers  but it now tends to be driven by the overnight rate at which  banks lend to each other  Bank loans can be customized to the borrower  s needs    They can have different maturities  as well as different interest payment and prin  cipal repayment structures   The frequency of interest payments varies among bank  loans   Some loans are bullet loans  in which the entire payment of principal occurs at  maturity and others are amortizing loans  in which the principal is repaid over time  For highly rated companies  both bilateral and syndicated loans can be more expen  sive than bonds issued in financial markets   Thus  companies often turn to money and  capital markets to raise funds  which allows them to diversify their sources of financing  
4,385,    Commercial Paper
5,385,Commercial paper is a short  term unsecured promissory note issued in the public  market or via a private placement that represents a debt obligation of the issuer   Commercial paper was first issued in the United States more than a century ago  It  later appeared in the United Kingdom in other European countries  and then in the  rest of the world 
6,385,      Characteristics of Commercial Paper
7,385,Commercial paper is a valuable source of flexible readily available and relatively low   cost short  term financing   It is a source of funding for working capital and seasonal  demands for cash  It is also a source of bridge financing that is  interim financing  that provides funds until permanent financing can be arranged  Suppose a company  wants to build a new distribution center in southeast China and wants to finance this  investment with an issuance of long  term bonds   The market conditions for issuing  long  term bonds may currently be volatile which would translate into a higher cost  of borrowing   Rather than issuing long  term bonds immediately the company may  opt to raise funds with commercial paper and wait for a more favorable environment  in which to sell long  term bonds   The largest issuers of commercial paper are financial institutions  but some non   financial companies are also regular issuers of commercial paper  Although the focus  of this section is on corporate borrowers  sovereign governments and supranational  agencies routinely issue commercial paper as well  The maturity of commercial paper can range from overnight to one year but a  typical issue matures in less than three months

4,386,Traditionally only the largest  most stable companies issued commercial paper   Although only the strongest  highest  rated companies issue low  cost commercial  paper issuers from across the risk spectrum can issue commercial paper with higher  yields than higher  rated companies   Thus  investors in commercial paper are exposed  to various levels of credit risk depending on the issuer  s creditworthiness   Many inves  tors perform their own credit analysis  but most investors also assess a commercial  paper  s credit quality by using the ratings provided by credit rating agencies   Exhibit    presents the range of commercial paper ratings from the main credit rating agencies    Commercial paper rated adequate or above  shaded area of Exhibit    is called  prime  paper  and it is typically considered investment grade by investors

15,386,In most cases  maturing commercial paper is paid with the proceeds of new  issuances of commercial paper a practice referred to as  rolling over the paper   This  practice creates a risk that the issuer will be unable to issue new paper at maturity  referred to as rollover risk   As a safeguard against rollover risk  credit rating agencies  often require that commercial paper issuers secure backup lines of credit from banks    The purpose of the backup lines of credit is to ensure that the issuer will have access  to sufficient liquidity to repay maturing commercial paper if rolling over the paper is  not a viable option  This is why backup lines of credit are sometimes called  liquidity  enhancement  or  backup liquidity lines    Issuers of commercial paper may be unable  to roll over the paper as a result of either market  wide or company  specific events    For example financial markets could be in the midst of a financial crisis that would  make it difficult to roll over the paper  A company could also experience some sort of  financial distress such that it could only issue new commercial paper at significantly  higher rates   In this case the company could draw on its credit lines instead of rolling  over its paper  Most commercial paper issuers maintain      backing  although some  large high credit quality issues carry less than      backing   Backup lines of credit  typically contain a  material adverse change  provision that allows the bank to cancel  the backup line of credit if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates substantially  Historically defaults on commercial paper have been relatively rare primarily  because commercial paper has a short maturity  Each time existing paper matures   investors have the opportunity to assess the issuer  s financial position and they can  refuse to buy the new paper if they estimate that the issuer  s credit risk is too high   Thus  the commercial paper market is quicker in withdrawing financing when an issuer  s  credit quality deteriorates than markets for longer  term securities   This reduces the  exposure of the commercial paper market to defaults   In addition corporate managers  realize that defaulting on commercial paper would likely prevent any future issuance  of this valuable financing alternative  The combination of short  dated maturity relatively low credit risk  and a large  number of issuers makes commercial paper attractive to a diverse range of institutional  investors  including money market mutual funds  bank liquidity desks  corporate

3,387,treasury departments  and institutional investors that have liquidity constraints    Most commercial paper investors hold their position to maturity  The result is little  secondary market trading except for the largest issues   Investors who wish to sell  commercial paper prior to maturity can either sell the paper back to the dealer to  another investor or in some cases  directly back to the issuer  The yield on commercial paper is typically higher than that on short  term sov  ereign bonds of the same maturity for two main reasons   First  commercial paper is  exposed to credit risk unlike most highly rated sovereign bonds   Second commercial  paper markets are generally less liquid than short  term sovereign bond markets   Thus   investors require higher yields to compensate for the lower liquidity  In the United  States  the yield on commercial paper also tends to be higher than that on short  term  municipal bonds for tax reasons   Income generated by investments in commercial  paper is usually subject to income taxes  whereas income from many municipal bonds  is tax exempt  Thus  to attract taxable investors  bonds that are subject to income taxes  must offer higher yields than those that are tax exempt

15,387,A difference between USCP and ECP is related to the interest provision  USCP  is typically issued on a discount basis that is  USCP is issued at a discount to par  value and pays full par value at maturity  The difference between the par value and  the issue price is the interest paid on the borrowing   In contrast  ECP may be issued  at  and trade on an interest  bearing or yield basis or a discount basis   The distinction  between the discount and the interest  bearing basis is illustrated in Exhibit    Some  aspects of the calculation such as the day count convention are discussed in the  introduction to fixed  income valuation reading

10,388,    Corporate Notes and Bonds
11,388,Companies are active participants in global capital markets and regularly issue corpo  rate notes and bonds   These securities can be placed directly with specific investors  via private placements or sold in public securities markets   This section discusses  various characteristics of corporate notes and bonds  
12,388,      Maturities
13,388,There is no universally accepted taxonomy as to what constitutes short  medium  and  long  term maturities   For our purposes  short term refers to original maturities of five  years or less   intermediate term to original maturities longer than five years and up to     years   and long term to original maturities longer than    years   Those securities  with maturities between   and    years are often considered notes  whereas securi  ties with maturities greater than    years are considered bonds   It is not uncommon  however to refer to bonds for all securities  irrespective of their original maturity  In practice most corporate bonds range in term to maturity between   and     years   In Europe however there are also bond issues with maturities of    and     years   In addition during the     s a number of corporate bonds were issued in the  United States with maturities of     years   these bonds are called  century bonds     The first century bond was issued by the Walt Disney Company in      as part of its  medium  term note program

2,389,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,389,Medium  term note  MTN  is a misnomer  As the century bond example above  illustrates  MTNs can have very long maturities   From the perspective of the issuer  the initial purpose of MTNs was to fill the funding gap between commercial paper  and long  term bonds   It is for this reason that they are referred to as  medium term    The MTN market can be broken into three segments   short  term securities that carry  floating or fixed rates  medium  to long  term securities that primarily bear a fixed  rate of interest  and structured notes   MTNs have the unique characteristic of being  securities that are offered continuously to investors by an agent of the issuer  This  feature gives the borrower maximum flexibility for issuing securities on a continuous  basis   Financial institutions are the primary issuers of MTNs  in particular short  term  ones   Life insurance companies  pension funds  and banks are among the largest buyers  of MTNs because they can customize the bond issue to their needs and stipulate the  amount and characteristics of the securities they want to purchase  These investors are  often willing to accept less liquidity than they would get with a comparable publicly  issued bond because the yield is slightly higher  The cost savings in registration and  underwriting often makes MTNs a lower cost option for the issuer 
4,389,      Coupon Payment Structures
5,389,Corporate notes and bonds have a range of coupon payment structures   Financial and  non  financial companies issue conventional coupon bonds that pay a fixed periodic  coupon during the bond s life  They also issue bonds for which the periodic coupon  payments adjust to changes in market conditions and or changes to the issuer  s credit  quality  Such bonds typically offer investors the opportunity to reduce their exposure  to a particular type of risk   For example FRNs  whose coupon payments adjust to  changes in the level of market interest rates  are a way to limit interest rate risk   some  of the inflation  linked bonds whose coupon payments adjust to changes in the level  of a consumer price index offer a protection against inflation risk   credit  linked cou  pon bonds  whose coupon payments adjust to changes in the issuer  s credit quality  are a way to reduce credit risk   Whether the periodic coupon is fixed or not  coupon  payments can be made quarterly semi  annually or annually depending on the type  of bond and where the bonds are issued and traded  Other coupon payment structures exist   Zero  coupon bonds pay no coupon   Deferred coupon bonds pay no coupon initially but then offer a higher coupon   Payment  in  kind  PIK  coupon bonds make periodic coupon payments  but not nec  essarily in cash  the issuer may pay interest in the form of securities  such as bonds or  common shares   These types of coupon payment structures give issuers more flexibility  regarding the servicing of their debt  
6,389,      Principal Repayment Structures
7,389,Corporate note or bond issues have either a serial or a term maturity structure  With  a serial maturity structure the maturity dates are spread out during the bond s life   a stated number of bonds mature and are paid off each year before final maturity   With a term maturity structure the bond s notional principal is paid off in a lump  sum at maturity  Because there is no regular repayment of the principal outstanding  throughout the bond s life a term maturity structure carries more credit risk than a  serial maturity structure  A sinking fund arrangement is a way to reduce credit risk by making the issuer  set aside funds over time to retire the bond issue  For example a corporate bond  issue may require a specified percentage of the bond s outstanding principal amount  to be retired each year  The issuer may satisfy this requirement in one of two ways    The most common approach is for the issuer to make a random call for the specified  percentage of bonds that must be retired and to pay the bondholders whose bonds  are called the sinking fund price which is typically par  Alternatively the issuer can  deliver bonds to the trustee with a total amount equal to the amount that must be

2,390,   
3,390,retired  To do so the issuer may purchase the bonds in the open market   The sinking  fund arrangement on a term maturity structure accomplishes the same goal as the  serial maturity structure that is  both result in a portion of the bond issue being  paid off each year  With a serial maturity structure however the bondholders know  which bonds will mature and will thus be paid off each year  In contrast  the bonds  retired annually with a sinking fund arrangement are designated by a random drawing

5,390,Unlike most highly rated sovereign bonds  all corporate debt is exposed to varying  degrees of credit risk   Thus  corporate debt is structured with this risk in mind  An  important consideration for investors is seniority ranking that is  the systematic way  in which lenders are repaid if the issuer defaults   In the case of secured debt  there  is some form of collateral pledged to ensure payment of the debt   In contrast  in the  case of unsecured debt  claims are settled by the general assets of the company in  accordance with the priority of payments that applies either legally or contractually  and as described in the bond indenture  Within each category of debt  secured and  unsecured  there are finer gradations of rankings  which are discussed in the reading  on credit analysis   There is a wide range of bonds that are secured by some form of collateral   Companies that need to finance equipment or physical assets may issue equipment  trust certificates   Corporate issuers also sell collateral trust bonds that are secured by  securities  such as common shares  bonds  or other financial assets   Banks  particularly  in Europe may issue covered bonds  which are a type of debt obligation that is secured  by a segregated pool of assets   Asset  backed securities are also secured forms of debt   Companies can and do default on their debt   Debt secured by collateral may still  experience losses  but investors in secured debt usually fare better than in unsecured  debt in bankruptcy proceedings   Investors who face a higher level of credit risk typi  cally require a higher yield than investors exposed to very little credit risk  
6,390,      Contingency Provisions
7,390,Contingency provisions are clauses in the indenture that provide the issuer or the  bondholders rights that affect the disposal or redemption of the bond  The three  commonly used contingency provisions are call put  and conversion provisions   Callable bonds give issuers the ability to retire debt prior to maturity  The most  compelling reason for them to do so is to take advantage of lower borrowing rates    By calling the bonds before their maturity date the issuer can substitute a new lower  cost bond issue for an older higher cost one  In addition companies may also retire  debt to eliminate restrictive covenants or to alter their capital structure to improve  flexibility  Because the call provision is a valuable option for the issuer investors  demand compensation ex ante  before investing in the bond   Thus  other things equal  investors require a higher yield  and thus pay a lower price  for a callable bond than  for an otherwise similar non  callable bond  Companies also issue putable bonds  which give the bondholders the right to sell  the bond back to the issuer at a predetermined price on specified dates before matu  rity  Most putable bonds pay a fixed rate of interest  although some bonds may have  step  up coupons that increase by specified margins at specified dates   Because the put  provision is a valuable option for the bondholders  putable bonds offer a lower yield   and thus have a higher price  than otherwise similar non  putable bonds   The main  corporate issuers of putable bonds are investment  grade companies   Putable bonds  may offer them a cheaper way of raising capital in particular if the company estimates  that the benefit of a lower coupon outweighs the risk associated with the put provision  A convertible bond is a hybrid security that lies on a continuum between debt and  equity  It consists of a long position in an option  free bond and a conversion option  that gives the bondholder the right to convert the bond into a specified number of
1,391,   
2,391,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,391,shares of the issuer  s common shares   From the point of view of the issuer convertible  bonds make it possible to raise funds that may not be possible without the incentive  associated with the conversion option  The more common issuers of convertibles  bonds are newer companies that have not established a presence in debt capital mar  kets but who are able to present a more attractive package to institutional investors  by including an equity upside potential  Established issuers of bonds may also prefer  to issue convertible bonds because they are usually sold at a lower coupon rate than  otherwise similar non  convertible bonds as a result of investors  attraction to the  conversion provision  However there is a potential equity dilution effect if the bonds  are converted  From the investor  s point of view convertible bonds represent a means  of accessing the equity upside potential of the issuer but at a lower risk reward profile  because there is the floor of the coupon payments in the meantime 
4,391,      Issuance Trading and Settlement
5,391,In the era before electronic settlement  there were some differences in the processes  of issuing and settling corporate bonds depending on where the securities were reg  istered  This is no longer the case  the processes of issuing and settling bonds are now  essentially the same globally  New corporate bond issues are usually sold to investors  by investment banks acting as underwriters in the case of underwritten offerings or  brokers in the case of best effort offerings   They are then settled via the local settle  ment system  These local systems typically possess a  bridge  to the two Eurobond  systems  Euroclear and Clearstream  As for Eurobonds from the corporate sector  they are all issued traded and settled in the same way irrespective of the issuer and  its local jurisdiction  Most bond prices are quoted in basis points   The vast majority of corporate bonds  are traded in OTC markets through dealers who  make a market  in bonds and sell  from their inventory  Dealers do not typically charge a commission or a transaction  fee  Instead they earn a profit from the bid offer spread  For corporate bonds  settlement differences exist primarily between new bond  issues and the secondary trading of bonds   The issuing phase for an underwritten  offering usually takes several days   Thus  settlement takes longer for new bond issued  than for the secondary trading of bonds  for which settlement is typically on a T      or T     basis

4,392,Solution to   
5,392,B is correct   A loan from a group of lenders to a single borrower is a syndicated  loan  A is incorrect because a bilateral loan is a loan from a single lender to a  single borrower  C is incorrect because securitization involves moving assets   such as loans  from the owner of the assets into a special legal entity 
6,392,Solution to   
7,392,C is correct   Companies use commercial paper as a source of funding working  capital and seasonal demand for cash as well as an interim source of financing  until permanent financing can be arranged

9,392,B is correct  Eurocommercial paper ranges in maturity from overnight to     days  
10,392,Solution to   
11,392,B is correct   With a serial maturity structure a stated number of bonds mature  and are paid off each year before final maturity  A is incorrect because a bond  issue with a term maturity structure is paid off in one lump sum at maturity  C  is incorrect because a sinking fund arrangement  like a serial maturity structure  results in a portion of the bond issue being paid off every year  However with a  serial maturity structure the bonds are paid off because the maturity dates are  spread out during the life of the bond and the bonds that are retired are matur  ing  the bondholders know in advance which bonds will be retired  In contrast   the bonds retired annually with a sinking fund arrangement are designated by  a random drawing

13,392,STRUCTURED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
14,392,Structured financial instruments represent a broad sector of financial instruments    This sector includes asset  backed securities  ABS  and collateralized debt obligations   CDOs   CDOs are securities backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obli  gations  and like ABS they are discussed in the reading on asset  backed securities    A common attribute of all these financial instruments is that they repackage and  redistribute risks    Our focus in this section is on structured financial instruments apart from ABS  and CDOs   These instruments typically have customized structures that often combine  a bond and at least one derivative  Some of these instruments are called structured  products   The use of derivatives gives the holder of the structured financial instrument  exposure to one or more underlying assets  such as equities  bonds  and commodities    The redemption value and often the coupons of structured financial instruments are  linked via a formula to the performance of the underlying asset s   Thus  the bond s  payment features are replaced with non  traditional payoffs that are derived not from  the issuer  s cash flows but from the performance of the underlying asset s   While
1,393,   
2,393,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,393,there is no universally accepted taxonomy used to categorize structured financial  instruments  we will present four broad categories of instruments in this reading   capital protected yield enhancement  participation and leveraged instruments  
4,393,    Capital Protected Instruments
5,393,Suppose an investor has         to invest  The investor buys zero  coupon bonds issued  by a sovereign issuer that will pay off         one year from now  Also suppose the  cost of buying the zero  coupon bonds is         The investor can use the       left  over from the purchase of the zero  coupon bond to buy a call option on some under  lying asset that expires one year from now  Buying a call option gives the investor the  right to buy the underlying asset in one year at a pre  determined price  The investor  will receive         when the zero  coupon bond matures and may also gain from  the upside potential of the call option if any  This combination of the zero  coupon  bond and the call option can be prepackaged as a structured financial instrument  called a guarantee certificate  The zero  coupon bond provides the investor capital  protection  at maturity the investor will receive      of the capital invested even if  the call option expires worthless   The call option provides upside potential if the price  of the underlying asset rises and a limited downside if the price of the underlying asset  falls   The downside is limited to the price often called the premium paid for the call  option  In our example the maximum loss the investor faces is       which is the  price paid for the call option  Capital protected instruments offer different levels of capital protection  A guar  antee certificate offers full capital protection  Other structured financial instruments  may offer only partial capital protection  Note that the capital protection is only as  good as the issuer of the instrument   Should the issuer of guarantee certificates go  bankrupt  investors may lose their entire capital 
6,393,    Yield Enhancement Instruments
7,393,Yield enhancement refers to increasing risk exposure in the hope of realizing a higher  expected return  A credit  linked note  CLN  is an example of a yield enhancement  instrument   Specifically it is a type of bond that pays regular coupons but whose  redemption value depends on the occurrence of a well  defined credit event  such as a  rating downgrade or the default of an underlying asset called the reference asset  If the  specified credit event does not occur the investor receives the par value of the CLN at  maturity  But if the specified credit event occurs  the investor receives the par value of  the CLN minus the nominal value of the reference asset to which the CLN is linked  A CLN allows the issuer to transfer the effect of a particular credit event to inves  tors   Thus  the issuer is the protection buyer and the investor is the protection seller   Investors are willing to buy CLNs because these securities offer higher coupons than  otherwise similar bonds   In addition CLNs are usually issued at a discount   Thus  if  the specified credit event does not occur investors will realize a significant capital  gain on the purchase of the CLN 
8,393,    Participation Instruments
9,393,As the name suggests  a participation instrument is one that allows investors to  participate in the return of an underlying asset   Floating  rate bonds can be viewed  as a type of participation instrument   As discussed earlier floaters differ from fixed   rate bonds in that their coupon rate adjusts periodically according to a pre  specified  formula   The coupon formula is usually expressed as a reference rate adjusted for a  spread  A floater has almost zero interest rate risk because changes in the cash flows
1,394,Structured Financial Instruments
2,394,   
3,394,limit the effect of changes in interest rates on the floater  s price  Thus  floaters give  investors the opportunity to participate in movements of interest rates   For example  the Italian government issued in June       floaters set to mature in June        The  coupon payments are delivered annually and determined by the formula of     of  the     year constant maturity swap rate a widely  used type of interest rate  Thus   investors who hold these floaters participate partially in movements of the     year  constant maturity swap rate  Most participation instruments are designed to give investors indirect exposure  to a particular index or asset price  For example investors who are precluded from  investing in equity directly may get indirect equity exposure by investing in participa  tion instruments that are linked via a formula to the performance of equity indexes    Many structured products sold to individuals are participation instruments linked to  an equity index  In contrast to capital protected instruments that offer equity exposure  these participation instruments usually do not offer capital protection 
4,394,    Leveraged Instruments
5,394,Leveraged instruments are structured financial instruments created to magnify returns  and offer the possibility of high payoffs from small investments   An inverse floater is  an example of a leveraged instrument   As the name suggests  an inverse floater is the  opposite of a traditional floater  The cash flows are adjusted periodically and move  in the opposite direction of changes in the reference rate  So when the reference rate  decreases  the coupon payment of an inverse floater increases   A general formula for an inverse floater  s coupon rate is   Inverse floater coupon rate   C    L   R  where C is the maximum coupon rate reached if the reference rate is equal to zero  L is the coupon leverage and R is the reference rate on the reset date  Note that the  coupon leverage indicates the multiple that the coupon rate will change in response  to a     basis points  bps  change in the reference rate  For example if the coupon  leverage is three the inverse floater  s coupon rate will decrease by     bps when the  reference rate increases by     bps   Inverse floaters with a coupon leverage greater than zero but lower than one are  called deleveraged inverse floaters   Inverse floaters with a coupon leverage greater  than one are called leveraged inverse floaters   For example the Royal Bank of Scotland  PLC issued a leveraged inverse floater set to mature in February        The coupon  payments are delivered quarterly and are determined by the formula of    minus  the euro    month Libor  In this case the coupon leverage is one  Thus  for a     bps  increase in the euro    month Libor the coupon rate of the leveraged inverse floater  will decrease by     bps   Inverse floaters often have a floor that specifies a minimum  coupon rate  for example a floor may be set at zero to avoid the possibility of a neg  ative interest rate

8,394, 
9,394,If an investor holds a credit  linked note and the credit event does not  occur the investor receives   A all promised cash flows as scheduled  B all coupon payments as scheduled but not the par value at maturity 
1,395,   
2,395,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,395,C all coupon payments as scheduled and the par value minus the nom  inal value of the reference asset to which the credit  linked note is  linked at maturity    A structured financial instrument whose coupon rate is determined by the  formula             Libor  is most likely  A a leveraged inverse floater  B a participation instrument   C a deleveraged inverse floater 
4,395,Solution to   
5,395,A is correct   If the credit event does not occur the issuer must make all prom  ised cash flows as scheduled that is  the regular coupon payments and the par  value at maturity 
6,395,Solution to   
7,395,C is correct   A structured financial instrument whose coupon rate moves in the  opposite direction of the reference rate is called an inverse floater  Because the  coupon leverage       is greater than zero but lower than one the structured  financial instrument is a deleveraged inverse floater  In this example if the  reference rate increases by     bps  the coupon rate decreases by    bps   A is  incorrect because the coupon leverage would have to be higher than one for the  structured financial instrument to be a leveraged inverse floater  B is incorrect  because a participation instrument is designed to give investors indirect exposure  to a particular underlying asset

9,395,SHORT  TERM FUNDING ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE  TO BANKS
10,395,Funding refers to the amount of money or resources necessary to finance some specific  project or enterprise  Accordingly funding markets are markets in which debt issuers  borrow to meet their financial needs   Companies have a range of funding alternatives   including bank loans  commercial paper notes  and bonds   Financial institutions such as  banks have larger financing needs than non  financial companies because of the nature  of their operations   This section discusses the additional funding alternatives that are  available to them  The majority of these funding alternatives have short maturities   Banks  such as deposit  taking  or depositary  institutions  typically have access to  funds obtained from the retail market that is  deposit accounts from their customers    However it is quite common for banks to originate more loans than they have retail  deposits   Thus  whenever the amount of retail deposits is insufficient to meet their  financial needs  banks also need to raise funds from the wholesale market   Wholesale  funds include central bank funds  interbank deposits  and certificates of deposit   In  addition to filling the gaps between loans and deposits  banks raise wholesale funds  to minimize their funding cost   At the margin wholesale funds may be less expensive   in terms of interest expense  than deposit funding   Finally financial institutions may  raise wholesale funds as a balance sheet risk management tool to reduce interest rate  risk  as discussed in Section

3,396,    Retail Deposits
4,396,One of the primary sources of funding for deposit  taking banks is their retail deposit  base which includes funds from both individual and commercial depositors   There  are several types of retail deposit accounts   Demand deposits  also known as checking  accounts  are available to customers  on demand   Depositors have immediate access  to the funds in their deposit accounts and use the funds as a form of payment for  transactions   Because the funds are available immediately deposit accounts typically  pay no interest   In contrast  savings accounts pay interest and allow depositors to  accumulate wealth in a very liquid form but they do not offer the same transactional  convenience as demand deposits   Money market accounts were originally designed to  compete with money market mutual funds   They offer money market rates of return  and depositors can access funds at short or no notice  Thus  money market accounts  are for depositors  an intermediate between demand deposit and savings accounts  
5,396,    Short  Term Wholesale Funds
6,396,Wholesale funds available for banks include reserve funds  interbank funds  and  certificates of deposit  
7,396,      Reserve Funds
8,396,Many countries require deposit  taking banks to place a reserve balance with the national  central bank   The reserve funds help to ensure sufficient liquidity should depositors  require withdrawal of funds   When a bank cannot obtain short  term funding  most  countries allow that bank to borrow from the central bank   In aggregate the reserve  funds act as a liquidity buffer providing comfort to depositors and investors that the  central bank can act as lender of last resort   Treatment of interest on reserve funds varies among countries  from a low interest  payment  to no interest payment  to charges for keeping reserve funds   Additionally  there is an opportunity cost to the banks for holding reserves with the central bank in  that these funds cannot be invested with higher interest or loaned out to consumers or  commercial enterprises   Some banks have an excess over the minimum required funds  to be held in reserve  At the same time other banks run short of required reserves    This imbalance is solved through the central bank funds market which allows banks  that have a surplus of funds to loan money to banks that need funds for maturities of  up to one year  These funds are known as central bank funds and are called  overnight  funds  when the maturity is one day and  term funds  when the maturity ranges from  two days to one year  The interest rates at which central bank funds are bought  i e   borrowed  and sold  i e  lent  are short  term interest rates determined by the markets  but influenced by the central bank s open market operations   These rates are termed
9,396,the central bank funds rates 
10,396,In the United States  the central bank is the Federal Reserve  Fed   The central  bank funds and funds rate are called Fed funds and Fed funds rates  respectively   Other short  term interest rates  such as the yields on Treasury bills  are highly cor  related with the Fed funds rate  The most widely followed rate is known as the Fed  funds effective rate which is the volume  weighted average of rates for Fed fund trades  arranged throughout the day by the major New York City brokers   Fed funds are traded  between banks and other financial institutions globally and may be transacted directly  or through money market brokers  
11,396,      Interbank Funds
12,396,The interbank market is the market of loans and deposits between banks   The term to  maturity of an interbank loan or deposit ranges from overnight to one year  The rate  on an interbank loan or deposit can be quoted relative to a reference rate such as an
1,397,   
2,397,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,397,interbank offered rate or as a fixed interest rate  An interbank deposit is unsecured so  banks placing deposits with another bank need to have an interbank line of credit in  place for that institution  Usually a large bank will make a two  way price indicating  the rate at which it will lend funds and the rate at which it will borrow funds for a  specific maturity on demand  Interest on the deposit is payable at maturity  Much  interbank dealing takes place on the Reuters electronic dealing system so that the  transaction is done without either party speaking to the other  Because the market is unsecured it is essentially based on confidence in the banking  system  At times of stress  such as in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers  bankruptcy  in      the market is prone to  dry up  as banks withdraw from funding other banks  
4,397,      Large  Denomination Negotiable Certificates of Deposit
5,397,A certificate of deposit  CD  is an instrument that represents a specified amount of  funds on deposit for a specified maturity and interest rate  CDs are an important source  of funds for financial institutions   A CD may take one of two forms   non  negotiable  or negotiable  If the CD is non  negotiable the deposit plus the interest are paid to  the initial depositor at maturity  A withdrawal penalty is imposed if the depositor  withdraws funds prior to the maturity date  Alternatively a negotiable CD allows any depositor  initial or subsequent  to sell  the CD in the open market prior to the maturity date  Negotiable CDs were intro  duced in the United States in the early     s when various types of deposits were  constrained by interest rate ceilings   At the time bank deposits were not an attractive  investment because investors earned a below  market interest rate unless they were  prepared to commit their capital for an extended period of time  The introduction of  negotiable CDs enabled bank customers to buy a three  month or longer negotiable  instrument yielding a market interest rate and to recover their investment by selling  it in the market   This innovation helped banks increase the amount of funds raised in  the money markets   It also fostered competition among deposit  taking institutions   There are two types of negotiable CDs   large  denomination CDs and small   denomination CDs   Thresholds between small  and large  denomination CDs vary  among countries   For example in the United States  large  denomination CDs are  usually issued in denominations of    million or more  Small  denomination CDs are  a retail  oriented product  and they are of secondary importance as a funding alterna  tive  Large  denomination CDs  in contrast are an important source of wholesale funds  and are typically traded among institutional investors   Like other money market securities  CDs are available in domestic bond markets  as well as in the Eurobond market   Most CDs have maturities shorter than one year  and pay interest at maturity  CDs with longer maturities are called  term CDs    Yields on CDs are driven primarily by the credit risk of the issuing bank and to a  lesser extent by the term to maturity  The spread attributable to credit risk will vary  with economic conditions and confidence in the banking system in general and in the  issuing bank in particular  As with all debt instruments  spreads widen during times  of financial turmoil as a result of an increase in risk aversion 
6,397,    Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
7,397,Repurchase agreements are another important source of funding not only for banks  but also for other market participants   A repurchase agreement or repo is the sale  of a security with a simultaneous agreement by the seller to buy the same security  back from the purchaser at an agreed  on price and future date   In practical terms   a repurchase agreement can be viewed as a collateralized loan in which the security
8,397,  Repurchase agreements can be structured such that the transaction is terminable on demand 
1,398,Short  Term Funding Alternatives Available to Banks
2,398,   
3,398,sold and subsequently repurchased represents the collateral posted  One party is bor  rowing money and providing collateral for the loan at an interest rate that is typically  lower than on an otherwise similar bank loan  The other party is lending money while  accepting a security as collateral for the loan  Repurchase agreements are a common source of money market funding for dealer  firms in many countries   An active market in repurchase agreements underpins every  liquid bond market   Financial and non  financial companies participate actively in  the market as both sellers and buyers of collateral depending on their circumstances    Central banks are also active users of repurchase agreements in their daily open  market operations   they either lend to the market to increase the supply of funds or  withdraw surplus funds from the market  
4,398,      Structure of Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
5,398,Suppose a government securities dealer purchases a       UK gilt that matures in  three years   The dealer wants to fund the position overnight through the end of the  next business day  The dealer could finance the transaction with its own funds  which  is what other market participants  such as insurance companies or pension funds  may  do in similar circumstances   But a securities dealer typically uses leverage  debt  to  fund the position  Rather than borrowing from a bank  the dealer uses a repurchase  agreement to obtain financing by using the gilt as collateral for the loan  A repurchase agreement may be constructed as follows   The dealer sells the        UK gilt that matures in three years to a counterparty for cash today  At the same time  the dealer makes a promise to buy the same gilt the next business day for an agreed  on  price  The price at which the dealer repurchases the gilt is known as the repurchase  price  The date when the gilt is repurchased the next business day in this example  is called the repurchase date  When the term of a repurchase agreement is one day  it is called an  overnight repo   When the agreement is for more than one day it is  called a  term repo   An agreement lasting until the final maturity date is known as  a  repo to maturity   As in any borrowing or lending transaction the interest rate of the loan must be  negotiated in the agreement   The interest rate on a repurchase agreement is called  the repo rate  Several factors affect the repo rate     The risk associated with the collateral  Repo rates are typically lower for highly  rated collaterals  such as highly rated sovereign bonds   They increase with the  level of credit risk associated with the collateral underlying the transaction     The term of the repurchase agreement   Repo rates generally increase with  maturity because long  term rates are typically higher than short  term rates in  normal circumstances      The delivery requirement for the collateral  Repo rates are usually lower when  delivery to the lender is required     The supply and demand conditions of the collateral  The more scarce a specific  piece of collateral the lower the repo rate against it because the borrower has  a security that lenders of cash want for specific reasons  perhaps because the  underlying issue is in great demand  The demand for such collateral means that  it considered to be  on special   Collateral that is not special is known as  gen  eral collateral   The party that has a need for collateral that is on special is typi  cally required to lend funds at a below  market repo rate to obtain the collateral     The interest rates of alternative financing in the money market   The interest on a repurchase agreement is paid on the repurchase date that is  at  the termination of the agreement  Note that any coupon paid by the security during the  repurchase agreement belongs to the seller of the security  i e  the borrower of cash  
1,399,   
2,399,Reading      Fixed  Income Markets  Issuance Trading and Funding
3,399,When a repurchase agreement is viewed through the lens of the cash lending  counterparty the transaction is referred to as a reverse repurchase agreement or  reverse repo  In the above example the counterparty agrees to buy the       UK  gilt that matures in three years and promises to sell it back the next business day at  the agreed  on price  The counterparty is making a collateralized loan to the dealer   Reverse repurchase agreements are very often used to borrow securities to cover  short positions   The question of whether a particular transaction is labeled a repurchase agreement  or a reverse repurchase agreement depends on one s point of view  Standard practice  is to view the transaction from the dealer  s perspective  If the dealer is borrowing cash  from a counterparty and providing securities as collateral the transaction is termed  a repurchase agreement   If the dealer is borrowing securities and lending cash to the  counterparty the transaction is termed a reverse repurchase agreement  
4,399,      Credit Risk Associated with Repurchase Agreements
5,399,Each market participant in a repurchase agreement is exposed to the risk that the  counterparty defaults  regardless of the collateral exchanged  Credit risk is present  even if the collateral is a highly rated sovereign bond  Suppose that a dealer  i e  the  borrower of cash  defaults and is not in a position to repurchase the collateral on the  specified repurchase date  The lender of funds takes possession of the collateral and  retains any income owed to the borrower  The risk is that the price of the collateral has  fallen following the inception of the repurchase agreement  causing the market value  of the collateral to be lower than the unpaid repurchase price  Conversely suppose  the investor  i e  the lender of cash  defaults and is unable to deliver the collateral  on the repurchase date  The risk is that the price of the collateral has risen since the  inception of the repurchase agreement resulting in the dealer now holding an amount  of cash lower than the market value of the collateral  In this case the investor is liable  for any excess of the price paid by the dealer for replacement of the securities over  the repurchase price  Although both parties to a repurchase agreement are subject to credit risk   the agreement is structured as if the lender of funds is the most vulnerable party   Specifically the amount lent is lower than the collateral s market value  The difference  between the market value of the security used as collateral and the value of the loan  is known as the repo margin although the term haircut is more commonly used  particularly in the United States   The repo margin allows for some worsening in  market value and thus provides the cash lender a margin of safety if the collateral s  market value declines   Repo margins vary by transaction and are negotiated bilaterally  between the counterparties   The level of margin is a function of the following factors      The leng th of the repurchase agreement   The longer the repurchase agreement   the higher the repo margin     The quality of the collateral  The higher the quality of the collateral the lower  the repo margin     The credit quality of the counterparty  The higher the creditworthiness of the  counterparty the lower the repo margin     The supply and demand conditions of the collateral  Repo margins are lower if  the collateral is in short supply or if there is a high demand for it

3,402,   Primary markets are markets in which issuers first sell bonds to investors to  raise capital  Secondary markets are markets in which existing bonds are subse  quently traded among investors      There are two mechanisms for issuing a bond in primary markets   a public  offering  in which any member of the public may buy the bonds  or a private  placement  in which only an investor or small group of investors may buy the  bonds either directly from the issuer or through an investment bank      Public bond issuing mechanisms include underwritten offerings  best effort  offerings  shelf registrations  and auctions      When an investment bank underwrites a bond issue it buys the entire issue and  takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers   In contrast  in a best efforts  offering  the investment bank serves only as a broker and sells the bond issue  only if it is able to do so  Underwritten and best effort offerings are frequently  used in the issuance of corporate bonds      The underwriting process typically includes six phases   the determination of the  funding needs  the selection of the underwriter the structuring and announce  ment of the bond offering  pricing  issuance and closing      A shelf registration is a method for issuing securities in which the issuer files a  single document with regulators that describes and allows for a range of future  issuances      An auction is a public offering method that involves bidding  and that is helpful  in providing price discovery and in allocating securities   It is frequently used in  the issuance of sovereign bonds      Most bonds are traded in over  the  counter  OTC  markets  and institutional  investors are the major buyers and sellers of bonds in secondary markets      Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments primarily for fiscal rea  sons   They take different names and forms depending on where they are issued  their maturities  and their coupon types   Most sovereign bonds are fixed  rate  bonds  although some national governments also issue floating  rate bonds and  inflation  linked bonds      Local governments  quasi  government entities  and supranational agencies issue  bonds  which are named non  sovereign quasi  government  and supranational  bonds  respectively     Companies raise debt in the form of bilateral loans  syndicated loans  commer  cial paper notes  and bonds      Commercial paper is a short  term unsecured security that is used by companies  as a source of short  term and bridge financing   Investors in commercial paper  are exposed to credit risk  although defaults are rare  Many issuers roll over  their commercial paper on a regular basis      Corporate bonds and notes take different forms depending on the maturities   coupon payment  and principal repayment structures   Important considerations  also include collateral backing and contingency provisions      Medium  term notes are securities that are offered continuously to investors by  an agent of the issuer  They can have short  term or long  term maturities      The structured finance sector includes asset  backed securities  collateralized  debt obligations  and other structured financial instruments   All of these seem  ingly disparate financial instruments share the common attribute of repackaging  risks

3,413,fixed  income securities   Clearly understanding how to value fixed  income securities  is important to investors  issuers  and financial analysts   This reading focuses on the  valuation of traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bonds  although other debt securities   such as floating  rate notes and money market instruments  are also covered  Section   describes and illustrates basic bond valuation which includes pricing  a bond using a market discount rate for each of the future cash flows and pricing a  bond using a series of spot rates   Valuation using spot rates allows for each future  cash flow to be discounted at a rate associated with its timing   This valuation meth  odology for future cash flows has applications well beyond the fixed  income market    Relationships among a bond s price coupon rate maturity and market discount rate   yield  to  maturity  are also described and illustrated  Section   describes how bond prices and yields are quoted and calculated in prac  tice  When bonds are actively traded investors can observe the price and calculate  various yield measures   However these yield measures differ by the type of bond  In  practice different measures are used for fixed  rate bonds  floating  rate notes  and  money market instruments   When a bond is not actively traded matrix pricing is  often used to estimate the value based on comparable securities   Section   addresses the maturity or term structure of interest rates   This discussion  involves an analysis of yield curves  which illustrates the relationship between yields   to  maturity and times  to  maturity on bonds with otherwise similar characteristics    Various types of yield curves are described  Section   focuses on yield spreads over benchmark interest rates   When investors  want relatively higher yields  they have to be prepared to bear more risk   Yield spreads  are measures of how much additional yield over the benchmark security  usually a  government bond  investors expect for bearing additional risk   A summary of key  points and practice problems conclude the reading  
4,413,BOND PRICES AND THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY
5,413,Bond pricing is an application of discounted cash flow analysis   The complexity of  the pricing depends on the particular bond s features and rate  or rates  used to do  the discounting   This section starts with using a single discount factor for all future  cash flows and concludes with the most general approach to bond valuation  The  general approach to bond valuation is to use a series of spot rates that correspond to  the timing of the future cash flows  
6,413,    Bond Pricing with a Market Discount Rate
7,413,On a traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bond the promised future cash flows are a  series of coupon interest payments and repayment of the full principal at maturity  The  coupon payments are on regularly scheduled dates  for example an annual payment  bond might pay interest on    June of each year for five years   The final coupon typically  is paid together with the full principal on the maturity date  The price of the bond at  issuance is the present value of the promised cash flows   The market discount rate is  used in the time  value  of  money calculation to obtain the present value  The market  discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the invest  ment in the bond  It is also called the required yield or the required rate of return

99,414,The coupon rate indicates the amount the issuer promises to pay the bondholders  each year in interest   The market discount rate reflects the amount investors need  to receive in interest each year in order to pay full par value for the bond  Therefore  assuming that these three bonds have the same risk  which is consistent with them  having the same market discount rate the    bond offers a  deficient  coupon rate   The amount of the discount below par value is the present value of the deficiency  which is    of par value each year  The present value of the deficiency discounted  using the market discount rate is

3,415,At this point  it is assumed that the bond is priced on a coupon payment date  If the  bond is between coupon payment dates  the price paid will include accrued interest   which is interest that has been earned but not yet paid  Accrued interest is discussed  in detail in Section      Equation    is a general formula for calculating a bond price given the market  discount rate

56,415,If the actual par value of the bond investment is in Singapore dollars for instance  SGD        the price is SGD         This bond is trading at a premium above par  value because the coupon rate of    per period is greater than the market discount  rate of    per period  Usually those interest rates are annualized by multiplying the  rate per period by the number of periods in a year  Therefore an equivalent statement  is that the bond is priced at a premium because its stated annual coupon rate of     is greater than the stated annual market discount rate of     Interest rates  unless  stated otherwise are typically quoted as annual rates

61,417,    Yield  to  Maturity
62,417,If the market price of a bond is known Equation   can be used to calculate its yield  to maturity  sometimes called the redemption yield or yield  to  redemption   The  yield  to  maturity is the internal rate of return on the cash flows the uniform interest  rate such that when the future cash flows are discounted at that rate the sum of the  present values equals the price of the bond  It is the implied market discount rate  The yield  to  maturity is the rate of return on the bond to an investor given three  critical assumptions     The investor holds the bond to maturity    The issuer makes all of the coupon and principal payments in the full amount  on the scheduled dates   Therefore the yield  to  maturity is the promised yield  the yield assuming the issuer does not default on any of the payments     The investor is able to reinvest coupon payments at that same yield  This is a  characteristic of an internal rate of return  For example suppose that a four  year    annual coupon payment bond is priced  at     per     of par value  The yield  to  maturity is the solution for the rate r in  this equation

90,417,Solving by trial  and  error search or using the time  value  of  money keys on a financial  calculator obtains the result that r            The bond trades at a premium because  its coupon rate      is greater than the yield that is required by investors           Yields  to  maturity do not depend on the actual amount of par value in a fixed   income portfolio  For example suppose a Japanese institutional investor owns a  three  year      semiannual payment bond having a par value of JPY    million  The  bond currently is priced at JPY          The yield per semiannual period can be  obtained by solving this equation for r

36,419,The first relationship is that the bond price and the market discount rate move  inversely  All bond prices in Exhibit   go up when the rates go down from     to      and all prices go down when the rates go up from     to      This happens because  of the fixed cash flows on a fixed  rate bond  The numerators in Equation    do not  change when the market discount rate in the denominators rises or falls   Therefore  the price  PV  moves inversely with the market discount rate  r   The second relationship reflects the convexity effect   In Exhibit   the percentage  price changes are calculated using this equation

22,420,The third relationship is the coupon effect   Consider Bonds A  B and C  which  have    years to maturity  For both the decrease and increase in the yield  to  maturity  Bond A has a larger percentage price change than Bond B and Bond B has a larger  change than C   The same pattern holds for the     year and     year bonds   Therefore  lower  coupon bonds have more price volatility than higher  coupon bonds  other  things being equal  The fourth relationship is the maturity effect   Compare the results for Bonds A  and D for Bonds B and E  and for Bonds C and F  The     year bonds have greater  percentage price changes than the     year bonds for either an increase or a decrease  in the market discount rate  In general longer  term bonds have more price volatility  than shorter  term bonds  other things being equal  There are exceptions to the maturity effect   That is why the word  generally    appears in the statement of the relationship at the beginning of this section  Compare  the results in Exhibit    for Bonds D and G for Bonds E and H and for Bonds F  and I  For the higher  coupon bonds trading at a premium Bonds F and I the usual  property holds the     year bonds have greater percentage price changes than the      year bonds   The same pattern holds for Bonds E and H which are priced initially  at par value  The exception is illustrated in the results for Bonds D and G which are  priced at a discount because the coupon rate is lower than the market discount rate   The     year     bond has a greater percentage price change than the     year      bond  Exceptions to the maturity effect are rare in practice  They occur only for low   coupon  but not zero  coupon  long  term bonds trading at a discount   The maturity  effect always holds on zero  coupon bonds  as it does for bonds priced at par value or  at a premium above par value

3,421,One final point to note in Exhibit   is that Bonds B E  and H which have coupon  rates of     all trade at par value when the market discount rate is      A bond having  a coupon rate equal to the market discount rate is priced at par value on a coupon  payment date regardless of the number of years to maturity

16,421,Solution to   
17,421,Bond D will go up in price the most on a percentage basis because it has the  lowest coupon rate  the coupon effect  and the longer time  to  maturity  the  maturity effect   There is no exception to the maturity effect in these bonds  because there are no low  coupon bonds trading at a discount  
18,421,Solution to   
19,421,Bond C will go down in price the least on a percentage basis because it has the  highest coupon rate  the coupon effect  and the shorter time  to  maturity  the  maturity effect   There is no exception to the maturity effect because Bonds C  and F are priced at a premium above par value 
20,421,Exhibit   demonstrates the impact on a bond price assuming the time  to  maturity  does not change  It shows an instantaneous change in the market discount rate from  one moment to the next   But bond prices change as time passes even if the market discount rate remains  the same  As time passes  the bondholder comes closer to receiving the par value at  maturity  The constant  yield price trajectory illustrates the change in the price of a  fixed  income bond over time  This trajectory shows the  pull to par  effect on the price  of a bond trading at a premium or a discount to par value  If the issuer does not default  the price of a bond approaches par value as its time  to  maturity approaches zero

38,422,    Pricing Bonds with Spot Rates
39,422,When a fixed  rate bond is priced using the market discount rate the same discount  rate is used for each cash flow  A more fundamental approach to calculate the price  of a bond is to use a sequence of market discount rates that correspond to the cash  flow dates   These market discount rates are called spot rates  Spot rates are yields   to  maturity on zero  coupon bonds maturing at the date of each cash flow  Sometimes  these are called  zero rates    Bond price  or value  determined using the spot rates is  sometimes referred to as the bond s  no  arbitrage value   If a bond s price differs from its  no  arbitrage value an arbitrage opportunity exists in the absence of transaction costs   Suppose that the one  year spot rate is    the two  year spot rate is    and the  three  year spot rate is     Then the price of a three  year bond that makes a    annual  coupon payment is

59,424, 
60,424,When investors purchase shares  they pay the quoted price  For bonds  however there  can be a difference between the quoted price and the price paid  This section explains  why this difference occurs and how to calculate the quoted price and the price that  will be paid  It also describes how prices are estimated for bonds that are not actively  traded and demonstrates how yield measures are calculated for fixed  rate bonds   floating  rate notes  and money market instruments  
61,424,    Flat Price Accrued Interest and the Full Price
62,424,   
63,424,When a bond is between coupon payment dates  its price has two parts   the flat price   PVFlat  and the accrued interest  AI   The sum of the parts is the full price  PVFull   which also is called the invoice or  dirty   price  The flat price which is the full price  minus the accrued interest  is also called the quoted or  clean  price  PVFull   PVFlat   AI   The flat price usually is quoted by bond dealers   If a trade takes place the accrued  interest is added to the flat price to obtain the full price paid by the buyer and received  by the seller on the settlement date  The settlement date is when the bond buyer  makes cash payment and the seller delivers the security  The reason for using the flat price for quotation is to avoid misleading investors  about the market price trend for the bond  If the full price were to be quoted by deal  ers  investors would see the price rise day after day even if the yield  to  maturity did  not change  That is because the amount of accrued interest increases each day  Then  after the coupon payment is made the quoted price would drop dramatically  Using  the flat price for quotation avoids that misrepresentation  It is the flat price that is   pulled to par  along the constant  yield price trajectory shown in Exhibit    Accrued interest is the proportional share of the next coupon payment   Assume  that the coupon period has  T  days between payment dates and that  t  days have  gone by since the last payment   The accrued interest is calculated using Equation

26,431,There are many ways to measure the rate of return on a fixed  rate bond investment    Consider a five  year zero  coupon government bond  The purchase price today is      The investor receives     at redemption in five years   One possible yield measure is      the gain of    divided by the amount invested     However investors want a  yield measure that is standardized to allow for comparison between bonds that have  different times  to  maturity  Therefore yield measures typically are annualized  A  possible annual rate for this zero  coupon bond is    per year     divided by five  years   But for bonds maturing in more than one year investors want an annualized  and compounded yield  to  maturity  Money market rates on instruments maturing in  one year or less typically are annualized but not compounded  They are stated on a  simple interest basis   This concept is covered later in this reading   In general an annualized and compounded yield on a fixed  rate bond depends  on the assumed number of periods in the year which is called the periodicity of the  annual rate  Typically the periodicity matches the frequency of coupon payments   A  bond that pays semiannual coupons has a stated annual yield  to  maturity for a peri  odicity of two the rate per semiannual period times two  A bond that pays quarterly  coupons has a stated annual yield for a periodicity of four the rate per quarter times  four  It is always important to know the periodicity of a stated annual rate  The periodicity of the annual market discount rate for a zero  coupon bond is  arbitrary because there are no coupon payments   For semiannual compounding  the  annual yield  to  maturity on the five  year zero  coupon bond priced at    per     of  par value is stated to be          This annual rate has a periodicity of two

94,433,An important concern for quoting and calculating bond yields  to  maturity is the  actual timing of the cash flows   Consider a    semiannual payment corporate bond  that matures on    March       Suppose that for settlement on    January      the  bond is priced at      per     of par value to yield        quoted on a semiannual  bond basis   Its coupon payments are scheduled for    March and    September of each  year  The yield calculation implicitly assumes that the payments are made on those  dates   It neglects the reality that    March      is a Sunday and    September       is a Saturday  In fact  the coupon payments will be made to investors on the following  Monday  Yield measures that neglect weekends and holidays are quoted on what is called  street convention  The street convention yield  to  maturity is the internal rate of  return on the cash flows assuming the payments are made on the scheduled dates    This assumption simplifies bond price and yield calculations and commonly is used  in practice  Sometimes the true yield is also quoted  The true yield  to  maturity is the

3,434,internal rate of return on the cash flows using the actual calendar of weekends and  bank holidays   The true yield is never higher than the street convention yield because  weekends and holidays delay the time to payment   The difference is typically small  no more than a basis point or two  Therefore the true yield is not commonly used in  practice  Sometimes  a government equivalent yield is quoted for a corporate bond   A government equivalent yield restates a yield  to  maturity based on        day  count  to one based on actual actual  The government equivalent yield on a corporate bond  can be used to obtain the spread over the government yield  Doing so keeps the yields  stated on the same day  count convention basis   Another yield measure that is commonly quoted for fixed  income bonds is the  current yield also called the income or interest yield  The current yield is the sum  of the coupon payments received over the year divided by the flat price  For example  a     year    semiannual coupon payment bond is priced at    per     of par value   Its current yield is

5,434,           
6,434,The current yield is a crude measure of the rate of return to an investor because it  neglects the frequency of coupon payments in the numerator and any accrued interest  in the denominator  It focuses only on interest income  In addition to collecting and  reinvesting coupon payments  the investor has a gain if the bond is purchased at a  discount and is redeemed at par value  The investor has a loss if the bond is purchased  at a premium and is redeemed at par value  Sometimes the simple yield on a bond is  quoted  It is the sum of the coupon payments plus the straight  line amortized share  of the gain or loss  divided by the flat price  Simple yields are used mostly to quote  Japanese government bonds  known as  JGBs

105,435,If a fixed  rate bond contains an embedded option other yield measures are  used  An embedded option is part of the security and cannot be removed and sold  separately  For example a callable bond contains an embedded call option that gives  the issuer the right to buy the bond back from the investor at specified prices on pre   determined dates   The preset dates usually coincide with coupon payment dates after  a call protection period  A call protection period is the time during which the issuer  of the bond is not allowed to exercise the call option  Suppose that a seven  year    annual coupon payment bond is first callable in  four years   That gives the investor four years of protection against the bond being  called  After the call protection period the issuer might exercise the call option if  interest rates decrease or the issuer  s credit quality improves   Those circumstances  allow the issuer to refinance the debt at a lower cost of funds   The preset prices that  the issuer pays if the bond is called often are at a premium above par  For example  the  call schedule  for this bond might be that it is first callable at      per     of par  value  on the coupon payment date in four years  callable at     in five years  and at  par value on coupon payment dates thereafter

169,436,    Yield Measures for Floating  Rate Notes
170,436,Floating  rate notes are very different from a fixed  rate bond  The interest payments  on a floating  rate note which often is called a floater or an FRN are not fixed  Instead  they vary from period to period depending on the current level of a reference interest  rate  The interest payments could go up or down  that is why they  float    The intent of  an FRN is to offer the investor a security that has less market price risk than a fixed   rate bond when market interest rates fluctuate  In principle a floater has a stable price  even in a period of volatile interest rates   With a traditional fixed  income security  interest rate volatility affects the price because the future cash flows are constant  With  a floating  rate note interest rate volatility affects future interest payments   The reference rate on a floating  rate note usually is a short  term money market  rate such as three  month Libor  the London Interbank Offered Rate   The principal  on the floater typically is non  amortizing and is redeemed in full at maturity  The

3,437,reference rate is determined at the beginning of the period and the interest payment  is made at the end of the period  This payment structure called  in arrears    The  most common day  count conventions for calculating accrued interest on floaters are  actual     and actual      Although there are many varieties of FRNs  only the most common and traditional  floaters are covered here  On these floaters  a specified yield spread is added to or  subtracted from the reference rate  For example the floater might reset its interest  rate quarterly at three  month Libor plus        This specified yield spread over the  reference rate is called the quoted margin on the FRN  The role of the quoted margin  is to compensate the investor for the difference in the credit risk of the issuer and that  implied by the reference rate  For example a company with a stronger credit rating  than that of the banks included in Libor may be able to obtain a  sub  Libor  cost of  borrowed funds  which results in a negative quoted margin  An AAA rated company  might be able to issue an FRN that pays three  month Libor minus        The required margin is the yield spread over or under the reference rate such that  the FRN is priced at par value on a rate reset date  Suppose that a traditional floater is  issued at par value and pays three  month Libor plus        The quoted margin is     bps   If there is no change in the credit risk of the issuer the required margin remains  at    bps   On each quarterly reset date the floater will be priced at par value  Between  coupon dates  its flat price will be at a premium or discount to par value if Libor goes  down or up  However if the required margin continues to be the same as the quoted  margin the flat price is  pulled to par  as the next reset date nears   At the reset date  any change in Libor is included in the interest payment for the next period  Changes in the required margin usually come from changes in the issuer  s credit  risk   Changes in liquidity or tax status also could affect the required margin  Suppose  that on a reset date the required margin goes up to    bps because of a downgrade  in the issuer  s credit rating   A floater having a quoted margin of    bps now pays its  investors a  deficient  interest payment   This FRN will be priced at a discount below  par value  The amount of the discount is the present value of the deficient future cash  flows   That annuity is    bps per period for the remaining life of the bond  It is the  difference between the required and quoted margins   If the required margin goes  down from    bps to    bps  the FRN will be priced at a premium  The amount of the  premium is the present value of the    bp annuity for the  excess  interest payment  each period  Fixed  rate and floating  rate bonds are essentially the same with respect to changes  in credit risk   With fixed  rate bonds  the premium or discount arises from a difference  in the fixed coupon rate and the required yield  to  maturity  With floating  rate bonds   the premium or discount arises from a difference in the fixed quoted margin and the  required margin  However fixed  rate and floating  rate bonds are very different with  respect to changes in benchmark interest rates   The valuation of a floating  rate note needs a pricing model  Equation   is a sim  plified FRN pricing model  Following market practice the required margin is called

4,440,    Yield Measures for Money Market Instruments
5,440,Money market instruments are short  term debt securities   They range in time  to   maturity from overnight sale and repurchase agreements  repos  to one  year bank  certificates of deposit   Money market instruments also include commercial paper  government issues of less than one year bankers  acceptances  and time deposits  based on such indexes as Libor and Euribor  Money market mutual funds are a major  investor in such securities   These mutual funds can invest only in certain eligible  money market securities   There are several important differences in yield measures between the money  market and the bond market     Bond yields  to  maturity are annualized and compounded  Yield measures in the  money market are annualized but not compounded  Instead the rate of return  on a money market instrument is stated on a simple interest basis     Bond yields  to  maturity can be calculated using standard time  value  of  money  analysis and with formulas programmed into a financial calculator  Money mar  ket instruments often are quoted using nonstandard  interest rates and require  different pricing equations than those used for bonds     Bond yields  to  maturity usually are stated for a common periodicity for all  times  to  maturity  Money market instruments having different times  to   maturity have different periodicities for the annual rate  In general quoted money market rates are either discount rates or add  on rates   Although market conventions vary around the world commercial paper Treasury bills   a US government security issued with a maturity of one year or less  and bankers   acceptances often are quoted on a discount rate basis   Bank certificates of deposit   repos  and such indexes as Libor and Euribor are quoted on an add  on rate basis   It  is important to understand that  discount rate  has a unique meaning in the money  market   In general discount rate means  interest rate used to calculate a present  value  for instance  market discount rate  as used in this reading   In the money  market  however discount rate is a specific type of quoted rate  Some examples will  clarify this point   Equation    is the pricing formula for money market instruments quoted on a  discount rate basis

10,444,The third difference between yield measures in the money market and the bond  market is the periodicity of the annual rate  Because bond yields  to  maturity are  computed using interest rate compounding  there is a well  defined periodicity  For  instance bond yields  to  maturity for semiannual compounding are annualized for a  periodicity of two  Money market rates are computed using simple interest without  compounding   In the money market  the periodicity is the number of days in the year  divided by the number of days to maturity  Therefore money market rates for different  times  to  maturity have different periodicities   Suppose that an analyst prefers to convert money market rates to a semiannual  bond basis so that the rates are directly comparable to yields on bonds that make  semiannual coupon payments   The quoted rate for a     day money market instrument  is     quoted as a bond equivalent yield which means its periodicity is         Using  Equation   the conversion is from m          to n     for APR

29,444,Therefore     for a periodicity of        corresponds to         for a periodicity  of two  The difference is significant      bps   In general the difference depends on  the level of the annual percentage rate  When interest rates are lower the difference  between the annual rates for any two periodicities is reduced 
30,444,THE MATURITY STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
31,444,There are many reasons why the yields  to  maturity on any two bonds are different    Suppose that the yield  to  maturity is higher on Bond X than on Bond Y  The following  are some possible reasons for the difference between the yields      Currency Bond X could be denominated in a currency with a higher expected  rate of inflation than the currency in which Bond Y is denominated     Credit risk Bond X could have a non  investment  grade rating of BB and Bond  Y could have an investment  grade rating of AA      Liquidity Bond X could be illiquid and Bond Y could be actively traded     Tax Status Interest income on Bond X could be taxable whereas interest  income on Bond Y could be exempt from taxation     Periodicity Bond X could make a single annual coupon payment  and its  yield  to  maturity could be quoted for a periodicity of one  Bond Y could make  monthly coupon payments  and its yield  to  maturity could be annualized for a  periodicity of    
32,444, 
1,445,   
2,445,Reading      Introduction to Fixed  Income Valuation
3,445,Obviously another reason is that Bond X and Bond Y could have different times  to   maturity  This factor explaining the differences in yields is called the maturity structure  or term structure of interest rates   It involves the analysis of yield curves  which are  relationships between yields  to  maturity and times  to  maturity  There are different  types of yield curves  depending on the characteristics of the underlying bonds   In theory maturity structure should be analyzed for bonds that have the same  properties other than time  to  maturity  The bonds should be denominated in the same  currency and have the same credit risk  liquidity and tax status   Their annual rates  should be quoted for the same periodicity  Also they should have the same coupon  rate so that they each have the same degree of coupon reinvestment risk   In practice  maturity structure is analyzed for bonds for which these strong assumptions rarely hold  The ideal dataset would be yields  to  maturity on a series of zero  coupon govern  ment bonds for a full range of maturities   This dataset is the government bond spot  curve sometimes called the zero or  strip  curve  because the coupon payments are   stripped  off of the bonds   The spot  zero or strip curve is a sequence of yields  to   maturity on zero  coupon bonds   Often these government spot rates are interpreted  as the  risk  free  yields   in this context  risk  free  refers only to default risk   There still  could be a significant amount of inflation risk to the investor as well as liquidity risk   A government bond spot curve is illustrated in Exhibit    for maturities ranging  from   to    years   The annual yields are stated on a semiannual bond basis  which  facilitates comparison to coupon  bearing bonds that make semiannual payments

19,445,  
20,445,This spot curve is upward sloping and flattens for longer times  to  maturity   Longer  term government bonds usually have higher yields than shorter  term bonds    This pattern is typical under normal market conditions   Sometimes  a spot curve is  downward sloping in that shorter  term yields are higher than longer  term yields    This downward sloping spot curve is called an inverted yield curve  The theories that  attempt to explain the shape of the yield curve and its implications for future financial  market conditions are covered in later readings  
1,446,The Maturity Structure of Interest Rates
2,446,   
3,446,This hypothetical spot curve is ideal for analyzing maturity structure because  it best meets the  other things being equal  assumption  These government bonds  presumably have the same currency credit risk  liquidity and tax status   Most impor  tantly they have no coupon reinvestment risk because there are no coupons to rein  vest   However most actively traded government and corporate bonds make coupon  payments   Therefore analysis of maturity structure usually is based on price data on  government bonds that make coupon payments   These coupon bonds might not have  the same liquidity and tax status   Older   seasoned   bonds tend to be less liquid than  newly issued debt because they are owned by  buy  and  hold  institutional and retail  investors   Governments issue new debt for regular times  to  maturity for instance     year and     year bonds   The current    year bond could be a     year bond that was  issued four years ago  Also as interest rates fluctuate older bonds are priced at a dis  count or premium to par value which can lead to tax differences   In some countries   capital gains have different tax treatment than capital losses and interest income  Analysts usually use only the most recently issued and actively traded government  bonds to build a yield curve  These bonds have similar liquidity and because they are  priced closer to par value they have fewer tax effects   A problem is that there are  limited data for the full range of maturities   Therefore it is necessary to interpolate  between observed yields   Exhibit    illustrates a yield curve for a government that  issues    year    year    year    year     year and     year bonds that make semiannual  coupon payments   Straight  line interpolation is used between those points on the  yield curve for coupon bonds

104,448,The fixed  income securities covered so far have been cash market securities   Money market securities often are settled on a  same day  or  cash settlement   basis    Other securities have a difference between the trade date and the settlement date  For  instance if a government bond trades on a T     basis  there is a one  day difference  between the trade date and the settlement date  If a corporate bond trades on a T      basis  the seller delivers the bond and the buyer makes payment in three business  days   Cash markets are also called spot markets  which can be confusing because spot  rate can have two meanings   It can mean the  rate on a bond traded in the spot  or  cash market    It can also mean  yield on a zero  coupon bond  which is the meaning  of spot rate used in this reading   A forward market is for future delivery beyond the usual settlement time period  in the cash market   Agreement to the terms for the transaction is on the trade date  but delivery of the security and payment for it is deferred to a future date  A forward  rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument traded in a forward  market   For example suppose that in the cash market  a five  year zero  coupon bond  is priced at    per     of par value  Its yield  to  maturity is         stated on a  semiannual bond basis

3,449,The notation for forward rates is important to understand  Although finance  textbook authors use varying notation the most common market practice is to name  this forward rate the   y y    This is pronounced  the two  year into five  year rate  or  simply  the   s    s    The idea is that the first number  two years  refers to the length of  the forward period in years from today and the second number  five years  refers to  the tenor of the underlying bond  The tenor is the time  to  maturity for a bond  or a  derivative contract   Therefore         is the   y y  forward rate for the zero  coupon  bond the five  year yield two years into the future  Note that the bond that will be a  five  year zero in two years currently has seven years to maturity  In the money mar  ket  the forward rate usually refers to months   For instance an analyst might inquire  about the   m m  forward rate on Euribor which is the rate on six  month Euribor  one month into the future  Implied forward rates  also known as forward yields  are calculated from spot  rates   An implied forward rate is a break  even reinvestment rate  It links the return on  an investment in a shorter  term zero  coupon bond to the return on an investment in  a longer  term zero  coupon bond  Suppose that the shorter  term bond matures in A  periods and the longer  term bond matures in B periods   The yields  to  maturity per  period on these bonds are denoted zA and zB  The first is an A period zero  coupon  bond trading in the cash market   The second is a B period zero  coupon cash market  bond  The implied forward rate between period A and period B is denoted IFRAB A   It is a forward rate on a security that starts in period A and ends in period B  Its tenor  is B   A periods   Equation    is a general formula for the relationship between the two spot rates  and the implied forward rate       zA A        IFRAB A B A        zB B   Suppose that the yields  to  maturity on three  year and four  year zero  coupon bonds  are       and       respectively stated on a semiannual bond basis   An analyst would  like to know the   y y   implied forward rate which is the implied one  year forward  yield three years into the future  Therefore A      periods  B      periods  B   A       periods  z              per period  and z              per period

22,450,A forward rate can be interpreted as an incremental or marginal return for  extending the time  to  maturity for an additional time period  Suppose an investor  has a four  year investment horizon and is choosing between buying a three  year zero   coupon bond that is priced to yield       and a four  year zero that is priced to yield         The incremental or marginal return for the fourth year is        the   y y    implied forward rate  If the investor  s view on future bond yields is that the one  year  yield in three years is likely to be less than        the investor might prefer to buy  the four  year bond  However if the investor  s view is that the one  year yield will be  more than the implied forward rate the investor might prefer the three  year bond and  the opportunity to reinvest at the expected higher rate  That explains why an implied  forward rate is the breakeven reinvestment rate  Implied forward rates are very useful  to investors as well as bond issuers in making maturity decisions

59,451,B is correct   The investor  s view is that the one  year yield in two years will be  greater than or equal to         The   y y   implied forward rate of        is the breakeven reinvestment  rate  If the investor expects the one  year rate in two years to be less than that   the investor would prefer to buy the three  year zero  If the investor expects the  one  year rate in two years to be greater than        the investor might prefer  to buy the two  year zero and reinvest the cash flow 
60,451,The forward curve has many applications in fixed  income analysis   Forward rates  are used to make maturity choice decisions   They are used to identify arbitrage oppor  tunities between transactions in the cash market for bonds and in derivatives markets    Forward rates are important in the valuation of derivatives  especially interest rate swaps  and options   Those applications for the forward curve are covered in other readings   Forward rates can be used to value a fixed  income security in the same manner as  spot rates because they are interconnected  The spot curve can be calculated from the  forward curve and the forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve  Either  curve can be used to value a fixed  rate bond  An example will illustrate this process   Suppose the current forward curve for one  year rates is the following

3,452,These are annual rates stated for a periodicity of one  They are effective annual rates    The first rate the   y y  is the one  year spot rate  The others are one  year forward  rates   Given these rates  the spot curve can be calculated as the geometric average of  the forward rates   The two  year implied spot rate is                                   z    z             The following are the equations for the three  year and four  year implied spot rates                                     z    z                                                        z    z             The three  year implied spot rate is         and the four  year spot rate is          Suppose that an analyst needs to value a four  year       annual coupon payment  bond that has the same risks as the bonds used to obtain the forward curve  Using the  implied spot rates  the value of the bond is         per     of par value

46,452,YIELD SPREADS
47,452,A yield spread in general is the difference in yield between different fixed income  securities   This section describes a number of yield spread measures  
48,452,    Yield Spreads over Benchmark Rates
49,452,In fixed  income security analysis  it is important to understand why bond prices and  yields  to  maturity change  To do this  it is useful to separate a yield  to  maturity into  two components   the benchmark and the spread  The benchmark yield for a fixed   income security with a given time  to  maturity is the base rate often a government bond  yield  The spread is the difference between the yield  to  maturity and the benchmark   The reason for this separation is to distinguish between macroeconomic and  microeconomic factors that affect the bond price and therefore its yield  to  maturity   The benchmark captures the macroeconomic factors   the expected rate of inflation  in the currency in which the bond is denominated general economic growth and the  business cycle foreign exchange rates  and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy   Changes in those factors impact all bonds in the market  and the effect is seen mostly  in changes in the benchmark yield  The spread captures the microeconomic factors  specific to the bond issuer and the bond itself   credit risk of the issuer and changes in  the quality rating on the bond liquidity and trading in comparable securities  and the  tax status of the bond  It should be noted however that general yield spreads across  issuers can widen and narrow with changes in macroeconomic factors   Exhibit   illustrates the building blocks of the yield  to  maturity starting with the  benchmark and the spread  The benchmark is often called the risk  free rate of return   Also the benchmark can be broken down into the expected real rate and the expected

3,453,inflation rate in the economy  The yield spread is called the risk premium over the   risk  free  rate of return  The risk premium provides the investor with compensation  for the credit and liquidity risks  and possibly the tax impact of holding a specific bond

15,453,The benchmark varies across financial markets   Fixed  rate bonds often use a  government benchmark security with the same time  to  maturity as  or the closest  time  to  maturity to the specified bond  This benchmark is usually the most recently  issued government bond and is called the on  the   run security  The on  the  run gov  ernment bond is the most actively traded security and has a coupon rate closest to  the current market discount rate for that maturity  That implies that it is priced close  to par value  Seasoned government bonds are called off  the   run  On  the  run bonds  typically trade at slightly lower yields  to  maturity than off  the  run bonds having the  same or similar times  to  maturity because of differences in demand for the securities  and sometimes  differences in the cost of financing the government security in the  repo market   A frequently used benchmark for floating  rate notes is Libor  As a composite  interbank rate it is not a risk  free rate  The yield spread over a specific benchmark  is referred to as the benchmark spread and is usually measured in basis points   If  no benchmark exists for a specific bond s tenor or a bond has an unusual maturity  interpolation is used to derive an implied benchmark   Also bonds with very long  tenors are priced over the longest available benchmark bond  For example      year  bonds  often called  century bonds   in the United States are priced over the     year  US Treasury benchmark rate  In the United Kingdom the United States  and Japan the benchmark rate for  fixed  rate bonds is a government bond yield  The yield spread in basis points over an  actual or interpolated government bond is known as the G  spread  The spread over  a government bond is the return for bearing greater credit  liquidity and other risks  relative to the sovereign bond  Euro  denominated corporate bonds are priced over a  EUR interest rate swap benchmark   For example a newly issued five  year EUR bond  might be priced at a rate of  mid  swaps  plus     bps  where  mid  swaps  is the aver  age of the bid and offered swap rates   The yield spread is over a five  year EUR swap  rate rather than a government benchmark   Note that the government bond yield or  swap rate used as the benchmark for a specific corporate bond will change over time  as the remaining time  to  maturity changes

3,454,The yield spread of a specific bond over the standard swap rate in that currency of  the same tenor is known as the I  spread or interpolated spread to the swap curve   This yield spread over Libor allows comparison of bonds with differing credit and  liquidity risks against an interbank lending benchmark   Issuers often use the Libor  spread to determine the relative cost of fixed  rate bonds versus floating  rate alternatives   such as an FRN or commercial paper  Investors use the Libor spread as a measure of  a bond s credit risk   Whereas a standard  interest rate swap involves an exchange of  fixed for floating cash flows based on a floating index  an asset swap converts the  periodic fixed coupon of a specific bond to a Libor plus or minus a spread  If the bond  is priced close to par this conversion approximates the price of a bond s credit risk  over the Libor index   Exhibit    illustrates these yield spreads using the Bloomberg  Fixed Income Relative Value  FIRV   page  This example is for the       IBM bond that matures on    September       The  spreads are in the top  left corner of the page  The bond s flat price was         per      of par value on   May      and its yield  to  maturity was         On that date  the yield spread over a particular Treasury benchmark was    bps   Its G  spread over  an interpolated government bond yield was    bps   These two spreads typically differ  by a few basis points  especially if the benchmark is on  the  run and has a somewhat  different maturity date  The bond s I  spread was    bps   That Libor spread is smaller  than the G  spread because five  year Treasury yields were lower than five  year Libor  swap rates at that time  The use of these spreads in investor strategies will be covered  in more detail in later readings   In general an analyst will track these spreads relative  to their averages and historical highs and lows in an attempt to identify relative value 
4,454,    Yield Spreads over the Benchmark Yield Curve
5,454,A yield curve shows the relationship between yields  to  maturity and times  to  maturity  for securities with the same risk profile  For example the government bond yield  curve is the relationship between the yields of on  the  run government bonds and  their times  to  maturity  The swap yield curve shows the relationship between fixed  Libor swap rates and their times  to  maturity  Each of these yield curves represents the term structure of benchmark interest rates   whether for  risk  free  government yields or  risky  fixed swap rates   Benchmark yield  curves tend to be upward  sloping because investors typically demand a premium for  holding longer  term securities   In general investors face greater price risk for a given  change in yield for longer  term bonds   This topic is covered further in the reading   Understanding Fixed  Income Risk and Return   The term structure of interest rates  is dynamic with short  term rates driven by central bank policy and longer  term rates  affected by long  term growth and inflation expectations   Isolating credit risk over varying times  to  maturity gives rise to a term structure of  credit spreads that is distinct for each borrower  The G  spread and I  spread each use  the same discount rate for each cash flow  Another approach is to calculate a constant  yield spread over a government  or interest rate swap  spot curve instead  This spread  is known as the zero volatility spread  Z  spread  of a bond over the benchmark rate   In Exhibit   the Z  spread for the IBM bond was reported to be    bps   The Z  spread over the benchmark spot curve can be calculated with Equation

3,457,SUMMARY
4,457,This reading covers the principles and techniques that are used in the valuation of  fixed  rate bonds  as well as floating  rate notes and money market instruments   These  building blocks are used extensively in fixed  income analysis   The following are the  main points made in the reading     The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the  risk of the investment in the bond     A bond is priced at a premium above par value when the coupon rate is greater  than the market discount rate     A bond is priced at a discount below par value when the coupon rate is less  than the market discount rate     The amount of any premium or discount is the present value of the  excess  or   deficiency   in the coupon payments relative to the yield  to  maturity     The yield  to  maturity the internal rate of return on the cash flows  is the  implied market discount rate given the price of the bond     A bond price moves inversely with its market discount rate     The relationship between a bond price and its market discount rate is convex      The price of a lower  coupon bond is more volatile than the price of a higher   coupon bond other things being equal     Generally the price of a longer  term bond is more volatile than the price of  shorter  term bond other things being equal  An exception to this phenome  non can occur on low  coupon  but not zero  coupon  bonds that are priced at a  discount to par value     Assuming no default  premium and discount bond prices are  pulled to par  as  maturity nears      A spot rate is the yield  to  maturity on a zero  coupon bond     A yield  to  maturity can be approximated as a weighted average of the underly  ing spot rates      Between coupon dates  the full  or invoice or  dirty    price of a bond is split  between the flat  or quoted or  clean   price and the accrued interest      Flat prices are quoted to not misrepresent the daily increase in the full price as  a result of interest accruals      Accrued interest is calculated as a proportional share of the next coupon pay  ment using either the actual actual or        methods to count days      Matrix pricing is used to value illiquid bonds by using prices and yields on  comparable securities having the same or similar credit risk  coupon rate and  maturity     The periodicity of an annual interest rate is the number of periods in the year     A yield quoted on a semiannual bond basis is an annual rate for a periodicity of  two  It is the yield per semiannual period times two     The general rule for periodicity conversions is that compounding more fre  quently at a lower annual rate corresponds to compounding less frequently at a  higher annual rate     Street convention yields assume payments are made on scheduled dates   neglecting weekends and holidays

3,458,   The current yield is the annual coupon payment divided by the flat price  thereby neglecting as a measure of the investor  s rate of return the time value  of money any accrued interest  and the gain from buying at a discount and the  loss from buying at a premium     The simple yield is like the current yield but includes the straight  line amortiza  tion of the discount or premium     The yield  to  worst on a callable bond is the lowest of the yield  to  first  call  yield  to  second  call and so on calculated using the call price for the future  value and the call date for the number of periods      The option  adjusted yield on a callable bond is the yield  to  maturity after add  ing the theoretical value of the call option to the price     A floating  rate note  floater or FRN  maintains a more stable price than a fixed   rate note because interest payments adjust for changes in market interest rates      The quoted margin on a floater is typically the specified yield spread over or  under the reference rate which often is Libor     The discount margin on a floater is the spread required by investors  and to  which the quoted margin must be set  for the FRN to trade at par value on a  rate reset date     Money market instruments  having one year or less time  to  maturity are  quoted on a discount rate or add  on rate basis      Money market discount rates understate the investor  s rate of return  and the  borrower  s cost of funds  because the interest income is divided by the face  value or the total amount redeemed at maturity and not by the amount of the  investment      Money market instruments need to be converted to a common basis for  analysis      A money market bond equivalent yield is an add  on rate for a      day year     The periodicity of a money market instrument is the number of days in the  year divided by the number of days to maturity  Therefore money market  instruments with different times  to  maturity have annual rates for different  periodicities      In theory the maturity structure or term structure of interest rates is the rela  tionship between yields  to  maturity and times  to  maturity on bonds having the  same currency credit risk  liquidity tax status  and periodicity     A spot curve is a series of yields  to  maturity on zero  coupon bonds      A frequently used yield curve is a series of yields  to  maturity on coupon bonds      A par curve is a series of yields  to  maturity assuming the bonds are priced at  par value     In a cash market  the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a  settlement date within a customary time period after the trade date for exam  ple  T          In a forward market  the delivery of the security and cash payment is made on a  predetermined future date     A forward rate is the interest rate on a bond or money market instrument  traded in a forward market      An implied forward rate  or forward yield  is the breakeven reinvestment rate  linking the return on an investment in a shorter  term zero  coupon bond to the  return on an investment in a longer  term zero  coupon bond     An implied forward curve can be calculated from the spot curve

3,459,   Implied spot rates can be calculated as geometric averages of forward rates      A fixed  income bond can be valued using a market discount rate a series of  spot rates  or a series of forward rates      A bond yield  to  maturity can be separated into a benchmark and a spread     Changes in benchmark rates capture macroeconomic factors that affect all  bonds in the market inflation economic growth foreign exchange rates  and  monetary and fiscal policy     Changes in spreads typically capture microeconomic factors that affect the par  ticular bond credit risk  liquidity and tax effects      Benchmark rates are usually yields  to  maturity on government bonds or fixed  rates on interest rate swaps      A G  spread is the spread over or under a government bond rate and an  I  spread is the spread over or under an interest rate swap rate     A G  spread or an I  spread can be based on a specific benchmark rate or on a  rate interpolated from the benchmark yield curve     A Z  spread  zero  volatility spread  is based on the entire benchmark spot curve   It is the constant spread that is added to each spot rate such that the present  value of the cash flows matches the price of the bond     An option  adjusted spread  OAS  on a callable bond is the Z  spread minus the  theoretical value of the embedded call option

5,485,BENEFITS OF SECURITIZATION FOR ECONOMIES AND  FINANCIAL MARKETS
6,485,The securitization of pools of loans and receivables into multiple securities provides  economies and financial markets with a number of benefits    Traditionally the purchase of such assets as houses and autos has been financed by  loans originated by financial institutions  such as commercial banks   For investors to  gain exposure to these loans  they must hold some combination of deposits  debt  or  common equity issued by banks   This creates an additional intermediary  that is  the  bank  between the borrowers and the investors   In addition by being constrained to  hold bank deposits and securities  investors cannot gain exposure to loans only   they  are also affected by economic risks undertaken in other bank activities   Securitization solves a number of these problems   It allows investors to achieve  more direct legal claims on loans and portfolios of receivables and enables these  investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their needs   Because

6,487,The following appeared in the July       publication by the Joint Forum titled   Report on Securitization Incentives  and published by the Bank for International  Settlements   Re  establishing sustainable securitization markets has been high on  the agenda of the Group of Twenty  G      the Financial Stability  Board  FSB an international body established to coordinate and  promote implementation of the work of financial authorities and  standard setting bodies  and other international organizations and  national governments since the onset of the crisis   The FSB s November         report to the G     leaders noted  in particular that  Re  establishing securitization on a sound basis  remains a priority in order to support provision of credit to the real  economy and improve banks  access to funding in many jurisdictions    Explain what is meant by the quotation in the FSB s November    report  
7,487,Solution 
8,487,Funding via securitization is a means by which non  bank entities can provide  investment funds to various sectors of the economy without those sectors rely  ing exclusively on banks   Securitization allows banks to originate monitor and  collect loans beyond what they could do if limited to their own deposits and  capital  Thus  securitization allows the non  bank and bank sectors to provide  credit to the real economy more cheaply and efficiently than would otherwise  be available only from banks

10,487,HOW SECURITIZATION WORKS
11,487,When assets are securitized several legal and regulatory conditions must be satisfied   A number of parties participate in the process to facilitate the transaction and ensure  these conditions are met   In this section a typical securitization is described by way  of a hypothetical example  The example describes the parties involved in a securiti  zation and their roles   It also introduces the typical structures of securitizations  such  as credit tranching and time tranching

17,489,Securitization requires the publication of a prospectus  a document that contains  information about the securitization   The three main parties to a securitization are     the seller of the collateral sometimes called the depositor  Mediquip in our  example      the SPE that purchases the loans or receivables and uses them as collateral to  issue the ABS MET in our example   The SPE is often referred to as the issuer  in the prospectus because it is the entity that issues the securities   it may also  be called the trust if the SPE is set up as a trust   and    the servicer of the loans  Mediquip in our example   Other parties are also involved in a securitization  independent accountants  law  yers attorneys  trustees  underwriters  rating agencies  and financial guarantors   All  these parties  including the servicer when it is different from the seller of the collateral  are referred to as third parties to the securitization  A significant amount of legal documentation is involved in a securitization  Lawyers  attorneys are responsible for preparing the legal documents   An important legal docu  ment is the purchase agreement between the seller of the collateral and the SPE  which
18,489,  To be more precise in the United States  a  base prospectus  and a  supplementary prospectus  are  typically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  The base prospectus provides definitions   information about the parties to the securitization and certain information about securities to be offered  in the future the types of assets that may be securitized the types of structures that will be used and the  types of credit enhancement  the last two are discussed in Section       The supplementary prospectus  provides the details of a specific securitization

3,490,sets forth the representations and warranties that the seller makes about the assets  sold  These representations and warranties assure investors about the quality of the  assets  an important consideration when assessing the risks associated with the ABS  Another important legal document is the prospectus  which describes the structure  of the securitization including the priority and amount of payments to be made to the  servicer administrators  and the ABS holders   Securitizations often use several forms of  credit enhancements  which are documented in the prospectus   Credit enhancements  are provisions that are used to reduce the credit risk of a bond issue  They include      internal credit enhancements  such as subordination overcollateralization and reserve  accounts  and     external credit enhancements  such as financial guarantees by banks  or insurance companies  letters of credit  and cash collateral accounts   Securitizations  often use subordination which is further discussed in Section    Prior to the            credit crisis  many securitizations included financial guarantees by a third party  The  most common third  party financial guarantors are monoline insurance companies or  monoline insurers   A monoline insurer is a private insurance company whose business  is restricted to providing guarantees for financial instruments such as ABS  Following  the financial difficulties and downgrading of the major monoline insurers as a result  of the financial crisis that began in the mortgage market in mid       few structures  in recent years have used financial guarantees from a monoline insurer  A trustee or trustee agent is typically a financial institution with trust powers that  safeguards the assets after they have been sold to the SPE  holds the funds due to the  ABS holders until they are paid and provides periodic information to the ABS holders    The information is provided in the form of remittance reports  which may be issued  monthly quarterly or as agreed to in the terms of the prospectus   Underwriters and rating agencies perform the same functions in a securitization  as they do in a standard bond offering

5,491,C
6,491,Solution to   
7,491,C is correct   The collateral is the pool of securitized assets from which the cash  flows will be generated  It is the  contracts  that is  the debt obligations that  have been securitized  These contracts are basically loans provided to purchas  ers of new or used motorcycles manufactured by Harley  Davidson Inc  and  its subsidiaries   These loans go by different names  such as conditional sales  agreements  promissory notes  and security agreements  
8,491,Solution to   
9,491,C is correct   Harley  Davidson Motorcycle Trust         is the issuer of the ABS  and thus  the SPE   We might have expected the SPE to purchase the contracts  that became the collateral from Harley  Davidson Inc  the manufacturer but  it is Harley  Davidson Credit Corp  that originates the loans and is  therefore  the seller of the collateral  Harley  Davidson Credit Corp  is also the servicer of  the contracts  
10,491,Solution to   
11,491,A is correct   Harley  Davidson Credit Corp  is the seller of the collateral  As the  servicer it is responsible for collecting payments from borrowers  notifying  borrowers who may be delinquent  and if necessary recovering and disposing  of the motorcycles if the borrower defaults  
1,492,How Securitization Works
2,492,   
3,492,    Structure of a Securitization
4,492,A simple securitization may involve the sale of only one class of bond or ABS  Let us  call this class Bond Class A   Returning to the Mediquip and MET example MET may  raise US     million by issuing        certificates for Bond Class A with a par value  of US      per certificate  Thus  each certificate holder is entitled to          of  the payments from the collateral after payment of servicing and other administrative  fees   what these fees represent is discussed in Section        The structure of the securitization is often more complicated than a single class  of ABS  As mentioned earlier it is common for securitizations to include a form of  internal credit enhancement called subordination also referred to as credit tranching   In such a structure there is more than one bond class or tranche and the bond classes  differ as to how they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers  whose loans are in the collateral  The bond classes are classified as senior bond classes  or subordinated bond classes hence the reason this structure is also referred to as a  senior subordinated structure  The subordinated bond classes are sometimes called   non  senior bond classes  or  junior bond classes    They function as credit protection  for the more senior bond classes   that is  losses are realized by the subordinated bond  classes before any losses are realized by the senior bond classes   This type of protection  is also commonly referred to as a waterfall structure because of the cascading flow of  payments between bond classes in the event of default   For example suppose MET issues two bond classes with a total par value of  US     million  Bond Class A  the senior bond class  with a par value of US     million  and Bond Class B the subordinated bond class  with a par value of US    million  In  this senior subordinated structure also referred to as credit tranching  Bond Class B  will absorb losses up to US    million  Thus  as long as defaults by Mediquip s custom  ers do not exceed US    million Bond Class A will be fully repaid its US     million   The purpose of this structure is to redistribute the credit risk associated with the  collateral  The creation of a set of bond classes allows investors to choose the level of  credit risk that they prefer to bear  More than one subordinated bond class may be created  Suppose MET issues the  following structure 
5,492,Bond Class
6,492,A  senior  B  subordinated  C  subordinated   Total
7,492,Par Value  US  millions 
8,492,            
9,492,In this structure Bond Class A is the senior bond class whereas both Bond Class  B and Bond Class C are subordinated bond classes from the perspective of Bond  Class A   The rules for the distribution of losses are as follows   All losses on the col  lateral are absorbed by Bond Class C before any losses are realized by Bond Class B  and then Bond Class A   Consequently if the losses on the collateral do not exceed  US    million no losses will be realized by Bond Class A or Bond Class B  If the  losses exceed US   million Bond Class B must absorb the losses up to an additional  US    million  For example if the total loss on the collateral is US    million Bond  Class C loses its entire par value of US   million and Bond Class B realizes a loss of  US    million of its par value of US    million  Bond Class A does not realize any  loss in this scenario  Clearly Bond Class A realizes a loss only if the total loss on the  collateral exceeds US    million  The structure of a securitization may also allow the redistribution of another type  of risk  called  prepayment risk   among bond classes   Prepayment risk is the uncer  tainty that the cash flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth
1,493,   
2,493,Reading      Introduction to Asset  Backed Securities
3,493,in the loan agreement because of the borrowers  ability to alter payments  usually to  take advantage of interest rate movements   For example when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to pay off part or all of their loans and refinance at lower interest rates    The creation of bond classes that possess different expected maturities is referred to  as time tranching and is further discussed in Section      It is possible and quite common for a securitization to have structures with both  credit tranching and time tranching  
4,493,EXAMPLE  
5,493,Bond Classes and Tranching
6,493,Return to the Harley  Davidson securitization described in Example    Based on  the information provided the form of credit enhancement that the transaction  most likely includes is   A  time tranching   B credit tranching   C a financial guarantee 
7,493,Solution 
8,493,B is correct   The Harley  Davidson securitization includes three bond classes    Class A    Class A    and Class B  Each bond class has a fixed but different  interest rate  the interest rate increases from       for Class A    notes to        for Class B notes   Thus  it is likely that the transaction has credit tranching and  that the three bond classes display a senior subordinated structure with Class  A    notes being senior to Class A    notes  and both Classes A    and A    notes  being senior to Class B notes  the subordinated bond class   As the credit risk  increases from the Class A    notes to the Class B notes  so does the interest  rate to reflect the additional compensation investors require for bearing the  additional credit risk   The information provided does not give any indication  of either time tranching or a financial guarantee 
9,493,    Key Role of the Special Purpose Entity
10,493,The SPE plays a pivotal role in securitization  In fact  the setup of a legal entity that  plays the same role as an SPE in terms of protecting the rights of ABS holders is a  prerequisite in any country that wants to allow securitization  Indeed without a pro  vision in a country  s legal system for the equivalent of an SPE  the benefits of using  securitization by an entity seeking to raise funds would not exist   Let us explain why  by returning to our example involving Mediquip and MET  Assume that Mediquip has a credit rating from a credit  rating agency such as  Standard   Poor  s  Moody  s Investors Service or Fitch Ratings   A credit rating reflects  the opinion of a credit  rating agency about the creditworthiness of an entity and or the  debt securities the entity issues   Suppose that the credit rating assigned to Mediquip  is BB or Ba   Such a credit rating means that Mediquip is below what is referred to  as an investment  grade credit rating   Assume again that Mediquip s treasurer wants to raise US     million and is con  templating doing so by issuing a five  year corporate bond rather than by securitizing  the loans   The treasurer is  of course concerned about the funding cost and would  like the lowest possible interest rate available relative to some benchmark interest rate   The difference between the interest rate paid on the five  year corporate bond and the  benchmark interest rate is the spread  The spread reflects the compensation investors
1,494,How Securitization Works
2,494,   
3,494,require for buying the corporate bond which is riskier than the bonds issued at the  benchmark interest rate  The major factor affecting the spread is the issuer  s credit  rating hence the reason the spread is called a  credit spread   Another factor that will influence the credit spread is whether the bond is backed  by collateral  A corporate bond that has collateral is often referred to as a secured  bond  The collateral usually reduces the credit spread making the credit spread of a  secured bond lower than that of an otherwise identical unsecured bond  In our exam  ple Mediquip s treasurer can use the loans on the medical equipment as collateral  for the secured corporate bond issue  Thus  if Mediquip issues a five  year corporate  bond to raise US     million the credit spread will reflect its credit rating primarily  and the collateral slightly  We will soon explain why the collateral affects the credit  spread only slightly  Now suppose that instead of using the loans as collateral for a secured corporate  bond issue Mediquip sells the loan contracts in an arm s length transaction to MET  the SPE   After the sale is completed it is MET not Mediquip that legally owns them   As a result if Mediquip is forced into bankruptcy while the loans are still outstanding   Mediquip s creditors cannot recover them because they are legally owned by another  entity  Note that it is possible however that transfers made to bankruptcy  remote  vehicles can be challenged as fraudulent conveyances and potentially unwound  The  legal implication of setting up MET is that investors contemplating the purchase of  any bond class backed by the cash flows from the pool of loans on the medical equip  ment will evaluate the credit risk associated with collecting the payments due on the  receivables independently of Mediquip s credit rating   Credit ratings are assigned to each of the various bond classes created in the secu  ritization  They depend on the quality of the collateral that is  how the rating agencies  evaluate the credit risk of the pool of securitized loans or receivables   Depending on  the structure of the securitization each bond class receives a credit rating that reflects  its credit risk  and some of the bond classes may have a better credit rating than the  company that is seeking to raise funds   As a consequence in aggregate the funding  cost of a securitization may be lower than that of a corporate bond issue  Access to  lower funding cost is a key role of the SPE in a securitization  A fair question is why a securitization can be cheaper than a corporate bond issue  secured by the same collateral as the securitization  The reason is that the SPE would  not be affected by the bankruptcy of the seller of the collateral  As mentioned above  the assets belong to the SPE  not to the entity that sold the assets to the SPE   In the  United States and other countries  when a company is liquidated creditors receive  distributions based on the absolute priority rule to the extent that assets are available   The absolute priority rule is the principle that senior creditors are paid in full before  subordinated creditors are paid anything   The absolute priority rule also guarantees  the seniority of creditors relative to equity holders   Whereas the absolute priority rule generally holds in liquidations  it has not always  been upheld by the courts in reorganizations   Thus  although investors in the debt of  a company may believe they have priority over the equity holders and priority over  other classes of creditors  the actual outcome of a reorganization may be far differ  ent from the terms stated in the debt agreement   that is  there is no assurance that  if the corporate bond has collateral the rights of the bondholders will be respected   For this reason the credit spread for a corporate bond backed by collateral does not  decrease dramatically  In the case of a securitization the courts have in most jurisdictions no discretion  to change seniority because the bankruptcy of a company does not affect the SPE   The  rules set forth in the legal document  which describes how losses are to be absorbed  by each bond class  are unaffected by the company  s bankruptcy  This important  decoupling of the credit risk of the entity needing funds from the bond classes issued  by the SPE explains why the SPE s legal role is critical 
1,495,   
2,495,Reading      Introduction to Asset  Backed Securities
3,495,The SPE is bankruptcy remote from the seller of the collateral which means that  the bankruptcy of the seller of the collateral will not affect the holders of securities  issued by the SPE and backed by the collateral  The security holders face credit risk  only to the extent that the borrowers whose claims the SPE has purchased default on  their loans   The SPE s ability to make cash payments to the security holders remains  intact as long as the borrowers make the interest payments and or the principal  repayments on their loans   However all countries do not have the same legal framework   Impediments have  arisen in some countries with respect to the issuance of ABS because the concept of  trust law is not as well developed globally as it is in the United States and many other  developed countries    Thus  investors should be aware of the legal considerations that  apply in the jurisdictions where they purchase ABS 
4,495,EXAMPLE  
5,495,Special Purpose Entity and Bankruptcy
6,495,Agnelli Industries  Agnelli  a manufacturer of industrial machine tools based  in Bergamo Italy has       million of corporate bonds outstanding   These  bonds have a credit rating below investment grade  Agnelli has      million of  receivables on its balance sheet that it would like to securitize  The receivables  represent payments Agnelli expects to receive for machine tools it has sold to  various customers in Europe  Agnelli sells the receivables to Agnelli Trust  a  special purpose entity  Agnelli Trust then issues ABS backed by the pool of  receivables  with the following structure

12,495,Bond Class A is given an investment  grade credit rating by the credit  rating  agencies     Why does Bond Class A have a higher credit rating than the corporate  bonds  If Agnelli Industries files for bankruptcy after the issuance of the asset   backed security   A Bond Classes A  B and C will be unaffected  B Bond Classes A  B and C will lose their entire par value  C  losses will be realized by Bond Class C first  then by Bond Class B and  then by Bond Class A   If one of Agnelli s customers defaults on its     million loan  A Bond Classes A  B and C will realize losses of     million each 
13,495, 
14,495,  In many EU countries  the creditors are protected in the recognition of the securitization as a true sale   The SPE has full legal ownership of the securitized assets  which are de  recognized from the seller  s balance  sheet   In the event of default of the originator servicer the SPE can appoint a substitute company to the  service role and continue to pay bondholders from the income stream of the securitized assets without the  other creditors of the initial originator servicer being able to have any recourse or claim to these assets

3,496,B Bond Class C will realize losses of     million but Bond Classes A and  B will be unaffected  C Bond Classes B and C will realize losses of     million each but Bond  Class A will be unaffected 
4,496,Solution to   
5,496,Bond Class A are issued by Agnelli Trust an SPE that is bankruptcy remote from  Agnelli  Thus  the investors who hold Agnelli s bonds and or common shares  have no legal claim on the cash flows from the securitized receivables that are  the collateral for the ABS  As long as Agnelli s customers make the interest  payments and or principal repayments on their loans  Agnelli Trust will be able  to make cash payments to the ABS investors   Because of the credit tranching   even if some of Agnelli s customers were to default on their loans  the losses  would be realized by the subordinated Bond Classes B and C before any losses  are realized by the senior Bond Class A   The credit risk associated with Bond  Class A is  therefore lower than that of Bond Classes B and C and the corporate  bonds  justifying the investment  grade credit rating  
6,496,Solution to   
7,496,A is correct   The ABS have been issued by Agnelli Trust  an SPE that is bank  ruptcy remote from Agnelli  If the securitization is viewed as resulting in a true  sale the fact that Agnelli files for bankruptcy does not affect the ABS holders    These ABS holders face credit risk only to the extent that Agnelli s customers  who bought the machine tools do not make the obligatory payments on their  loans   As long as the customers continue to make payments  all three bond  classes will receive their expected cash flows   These cash flows are completely  and legally independent of anything that happens to Agnelli itself 
8,496,Solution to   
9,496,B is correct   The rules for the distribution of losses are as follows   All losses on  the collateral are absorbed by Bond Class C before any losses are realized by  Bond Class B and then Bond Class A   Consequently if the losses on the collateral  are     million which is the par value of Bond Class C  Bond Class C loses its  entire par value but Bond Classes A and B are unaffected

11,496,RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS
12,496,Before describing the various types of residential mortgage  backed securities  this  section briefly discusses the fundamental features of the underlying assets   residential  mortgage loans   The mortgage designs described in this section are those that are  typically securitized  A mortgage loan or simply mortgage is a loan secured by the collateral of some  specified real estate property that obliges the borrower  often someone wishing to  buy a home  to make a predetermined series of payments to the lender  often initially  a bank or mortgage company   The mortgage gives the lender the right to foreclose  on the loan if the borrower defaults   that is  a foreclosure allows the lender to take  possession of the mortgaged property and then sell it in order to recover funds toward  satisfying the debt obligation  Typically the amount of the loan advanced to buy the property is less than the  property  s purchase price  The borrower makes a down payment  and the amount  borrowed is the difference between the property  s purchase price and the down
1,497,   
2,497,Reading      Introduction to Asset  Backed Securities
3,497,payment   When the loan is first taken out  the borrower  s equity in the property is  equal to the down payment   Over time as the market value of the property changes   the borrower  s equity also changes   It also changes as the borrower makes mortgage  payments that include principal repayment   The ratio of the amount of the mortgage to the property  s value is called the loan   to  value ratio  LTV    The lower the LTV the higher the borrower  s equity  From the  lender  s perspective the higher the borrower  s equity the less likely the borrower  is to default   Moreover the lower the LTV the more protection the lender has for  recovering the amount loaned if the borrower does default and the lender repossesses  and sells the property  In the United States  market participants typically identify two types of mort  gages based on the credit quality of the borrower   prime loans and subprime loans    Generally for a loan to be considered prime the borrower must be viewed as having  high credit quality   that is  the borrower must have strong employment and credit  histories  income sufficient to pay the loan obligation and substantial equity in the  underlying property  If the borrower has lower credit quality or if the loan is not a  first lien on the property  that is  a party other than the current potential lender has  a prior claim on the underlying property  the loan is treated as subprime  Throughout the world there are a considerable number of mortgage designs    Mortgage design means the specification of     the maturity of the loan     how the  interest rate is determined     how the principal is to be repaid  that is  the amor  tization schedule      whether the borrower has the option to prepay and in such  cases  whether any prepayment penalties might be imposed and     the rights of the  lender in a foreclosure  A study by Lea        provides an excellent review of mortgage designs in Australia   Canada  Denmark  Ireland Japan Germany the Netherlands  South Korea  Spain the  United Kingdom and the United States    This section draws on this study to describe  the five specifications of a mortgage design 
4,497,    Maturity
5,497,In the United States  the typical maturity of a mortgage ranges from    to    years    For most countries in Europe a residential mortgage typically has a maturity between     and    years  but in some countries  such as France and Spain it can be as long as     years   Japan is an extreme case  the maturity of a mortgage can be     years    Note  that what is called the term of a mortgage means the number of years to maturity 
6,497,    Interest Rate Determination
7,497,The interest rate on a mortgage is called the mortgage rate contract rate or note  rate  How the mortgage rate is determined varies considerably among countries   The  four basic ways that the mortgage rate can be specified are as follows      Fixed rate   The mortgage rate remains the same during the life of the mortgage   The United States and France have a high proportion of this type of interest rate  determination  Although fixed  rate mortgages are not the dominant form in  Germany they do exist there 
8,497,  Lea       Table   p         The term of residential mortgages is usually in line with the age of the borrower at the end of the loan  maturity period with the borrower  s retirement age being a usual upper limit

3,498,   Adjustable or variable rate   The mortgage rate is reset periodically daily  weekly monthly or annually  The determination of the new mortgage rate for  an adjustable  rate mortgage  ARM  at the reset date may be based on some  reference rate or index  in which case it is called an indexed  referenced ARM   or a rate determined at the lender  s discretion  in which case it is called a  reviewable ARM   Residential mortgages in Australia  Ireland South Korea   Spain and the United Kingdom are dominated by adjustable  rate mortgages   In  Australia  Ireland and the United Kingdom the reviewable ARM is standard   In South Korea and Spain the indexed  referenced ARM is the norm  Canada  and the United States have ARMs that are typically tied to an index or reference  rate although this type of mortgage rate is not the dominant form of interest  rate determination  An important feature of an ARM is that it will usually have  a maximum interest rate by which the mortgage rate can change at a reset date  and a maximum interest rate that the mortgage rate can reach during the mort  gage s life     Initial period fixed rate   The mortgage rate is fixed for some initial period and  is then adjusted  The adjustment may call for a new fixed rate or for a variable  rate  When the adjustment calls for a fixed rate the mortgage is referred to as a  rollover or renegotiable mortgage  This mortgage design is dominant in Canada   Denmark  Germany the Netherlands  and Switzerland  When the mortgage  starts out with a fixed rate and then switches to an adjustable rate after a  specified initial term the mortgage is referred to as a hybrid mortgage  Hybrid  mortgages are popular in the United Kingdom     Convertible  The mortgage rate is initially either a fixed rate or an adjustable  rate  At some point  the borrower has the option to convert the mortgage to a  fixed rate or an adjustable rate for the remainder of the mortgage s life  Almost  half of the mortgages in Japan are convertible 
4,498,    Amortization Schedule
5,498,In most countries  residential mortgages are amortizing loans  The amortization of  a loan means the gradual reduction of the amount borrowed over time  Assuming  no prepayments are made by the borrower the periodic mortgage payments made by  the borrower consist of interest payments and scheduled principal repayments   The  scheduled principal repayment is the amount of reduction of the outstanding mort  gage balance and is thus referred to as the amortization  As discussed in a previous  reading  there are two types of amortizing loans   fully amortizing loans and partially  amortizing loans   In a fully amortizing loan the sum of all the scheduled principal  repayments during the mortgage s life is such that when the last mortgage payment  is made the loan is fully repaid  Most residential mortgages in the United States are  fully amortizing loans   In a partially amortizing loan the sum of all the scheduled  principal repayments is less than the amount borrowed  The last payment that has  to be made is then the unpaid mortgage balance and that last payment is said to be  a  balloon  payment   If no scheduled principal repayment is specified for a certain number of years  the  loan is said to be an interest  only mortgage  Interest  only mortgages are available  in Australia  Denmark  Finland France Germany Greece Ireland the Netherlands   Portugal South Korea  Spain Switzerland and the United Kingdom   Interest  only  mortgages are also available to a limited extent in the United States   A special type of  interest  only mortgage is one in which there are no scheduled principal repayments

3,499,over the entire life of the loan  In this case the balloon payment is equal to the original  loan amount   These mortgages  referred to as  interest  only lifetime mortgages  or   bullet mortgages   are available in Denmark  the Netherlands  and the United Kingdom 
4,499,    Prepayment Options and Prepayment Penalties
5,499,A prepayment is any payment toward the repayment of principal that is in excess of the  scheduled principal repayment   A mortgage may entitle the borrower to prepay all or  part of the outstanding mortgage principal prior to the scheduled due date when the  principal must be repaid  This contractual provision is referred to as a prepayment  option or an early repayment option  From the lender  s or investor  s viewpoint  the  effect of a prepayment option is that the amount and timing of the cash flows from  a mortgage cannot be known with certainty  This risk was referred to as prepayment  risk in Section    Prepayment risk affects all mortgages that allow prepayment  not  just the level  payment  fixed  rate fully amortizing mortgages   The mortgage may stipulate some sort of monetary penalty when a borrower  prepays within a certain time period after the mortgage is originated and this time  period may extend for the full life of the loan  Such mortgage designs are referred to  as prepayment penalty mortgages  The purpose of the prepayment penalty is to  compensate the lender for the difference between the contract rate and the prevailing  mortgage rate if the borrower prepays when interest rates decline  Hence the prepay  ment penalty is effectively a mechanism that provides for yield maintenance for the  lender  The method for calculating the penalty varies   Prepayment penalty mortgages  are common in Europe  Although the proportion of prepayment penalty mortgages  in the United States is small they do exist  
6,499,    Rights of the Lender in a Foreclosure
7,499,A mortgage can be a recourse loan or a non  recourse loan  When the borrower fails to  make the contractual loan payments  the lender can repossess the property and sell it   but the proceeds received from the sale of the property may be insufficient to recoup  the losses   In a recourse loan the lender has a claim against the borrower for the  shortfall between the amount of the outstanding mortgage balance and the proceeds  received from the sale of the property  In a non  recourse loan the lender does not  have such a claim and thus can look only to the property to recover the outstanding  mortgage balance  In the United States  recourse is typically determined by the state  and residential mortgages are non  recourse loans in many states   In contrast  resi  dential mortgages in most European countries are recourse loans   The recourse non  recourse feature of a mortgage has implications for projecting the  likelihood of defaults by borrowers  particularly in the case of what is sometimes called   underwater mortgages  that is  mortgages for which the value of the property has  declined below the amount owed by the borrower  For example in the United States   where mortgages are typically non  recourse the borrower may have an incentive to  default on an underwater mortgage and allow the lender to foreclose on the property  even if resources are available to continue to make mortgage payments   This type of  default by a borrower is referred to as a  strategic default    A strategic default  how  ever has negative consequences for the borrower who will then have a lower credit  score and a reduced ability to borrow in the future  Thus  not all borrowers faced  with underwater mortgages will default   In countries where residential mortgages are  recourse loans  a strategic default is less likely because the lender can seek to recover  the shortfall from the borrower  s other assets and or income

7,500,In an interest  only mortgage the borrower   A does not have to repay the principal as long as she pays the interest   B does not have to make principal repayments for a certain number of  years  after which she starts paying down the original loan amount   C does not have to make principal repayments over the entire life of  the mortgage and pays down the original loan amount as a balloon  payment     A bank advertises a mortgage with the following interest rate              month Euribor          resetting once a year  The mortgage is most  likely  A a hybrid mortgage  B an adjustable  rate mortgage  C an initial period fixed  rate mortgage  If the borrower fails to make the contractual mortgage payments on a  non  recourse mortgage the lender   A cannot foreclose the property  B can only recover the outstanding mortgage balance through the sale of  the property  C can recover the outstanding mortgage balance through the sale of the  property and the borrower  s other assets and or income 
8,500, 
9,500,Solution to   
10,500,B is correct   In an interest  only mortgage there is no scheduled principal  repayment for a certain number of years  so the borrower starts paying down  the original loan amount only after an initial period of interest  only payments    Some but not all interest  only mortgages do not have scheduled principal  repayments over the entire life of the loan  These mortgages are called interest   only lifetime mortgages or bullet mortgages  and they require the borrower to  pay back the original loan amount at maturity 
11,500,Solution to   
12,500,B is correct   An adjustable  rate mortgage is one for which the mortgage rate  is typically based on some reference rate or index  indexed  referenced ARM   or a rate determined at the lender  s discretion  reviewable ARM  and is reset  periodically  A mortgage rate of     month Euribor         resetting once per  year suggests that the mortgage is an index  referenced ARM  The       rate  is the current mortgage rate  that is      month Euribor of                and  should not be taken as an indication that it is a fixed  rate initial period fixed   rate or hybrid mortgage

4,501,Solution to   
5,501,B is correct   In the case of a non  recourse mortgage the lender can foreclose  the property if the borrower fails to make the contractual mortgage payments    However the lender can use only the proceeds from the property to recover the  outstanding mortgage balance 
6,501,RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE  BACKED SECURITIES
7,501,The bonds created from the securitization of mortgages related to the purchase of  residential properties are residential mortgage  backed securities  RMBS   In such  countries as the United States  Canada  Japan and South Korea  a distinction is often  made between securities that are guaranteed by the government or a quasi  government  entity and securities that are not   Quasi  government entities are usually created by  governments to perform various functions for them  Examples of quasi  government  entities include government  sponsored enterprises  GSEs  such as Fannie Mae  pre  viously the Federal National Mortgage Association  and Freddie Mac  previously  the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  in the United States and the Japan  Housing Finance Agency   JHF   In the United States  securities backed by residential mortgages are divided into  three sectors       those guaranteed by a federal agency     those guaranteed by a  GSE  and     those issued by private entities and that are not guaranteed by a federal  agency or a GSE   The first two sectors are referred to as agency RMBS and the third  sector as non  agency RMBS  A significant amount of space in this section is devoted  to US agency and non  agency RMBS because these securities represent a large sector  of the investment  grade bond market and are included in the portfolios of many US  as well as non  US investors   Agency RMBS include securities issued by federal agencies  such as the Government  National Mortgage Association popularly referred to as Ginnie Mae  This entity is a  federally related institution because it is part of the US Department of Housing and  Urban Development   As a result  the RMBS that it guarantees carry the full faith and  credit of the US government with respect to timely payment of interest and repay  ment of principal  Agency RMBS also include RMBS issued by GSEs  such as Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  RMBS issued by GSEs do not carry the full faith and credit of the US  government    Agency RMBS issued by GSEs differ from non  agency RMBS in two  ways   First  the credit risk of the RMBS issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is  reduced by the guarantee of the GSE itself which charges a fee for insuring the  issue  In contrast  non  agency RMBS use credit enhancements to reduce credit risk   which is further discussed in Section      The second way in which RMBS issued by  GSEs differ from non  agency RMBS is with regard to the pool of securitized loans    For a loan to be included in a pool of loans backing an agency RMBS it must meet  specific underwriting standards established by various government agencies   These  standards set forth the maximum size of the loan the loan documentation required  the maximum loan  to  value ratio and whether or not insurance is required  If a loan  satisfies the underwriting standards for inclusion as collateral for an agency RMBS it  is called a  conforming mortgage   If a loan fails to satisfy the underwriting standards   it is called a  non  conforming mortgage

3,502,This section starts with a discussion of agency RMBS which include mortgage  pass  through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations   We then discuss  non  agency RMBS  
4,502,    Mortgage Pass  Through Securities
5,502,A mortgage pass  through security is a security created when one or more holders  of mortgages form a pool of mortgages and sell shares or participation certificates  in the pool  A pool can consist of several thousand or only a few mortgages   When a  mortgage is included in a pool of mortgages that is used as collateral for a mortgage  pass  through security the mortgage is said to be securitized 
6,502,      Characteristics
7,502,The cash flows of a mortgage pass  through security depend on the cash flows of the  underlying pool of mortgages   The cash flows consist of monthly mortgage payments  representing interest  the scheduled repayment of principal and any prepayments    Cash payments are made to security holders each month  Neither the amount nor the  timing of the cash flows from the pool of mortgages  however is necessarily identical  to that of the cash flow passed through to the security holders   In fact  the monthly  cash flows of a mortgage pass  through security are less than the monthly cash flow  of the underlying pool of mortgages by an amount equal to the servicing and other  administrative fees   The servicing fee is the charge related to servicing the mortgages   Servicing involves  collecting monthly payments from borrowers  forwarding proceeds to owners of the  loan sending payment notices to borrowers  reminding borrowers when payments  are overdue maintaining records of the outstanding mortgage balance initiating  foreclosure proceedings if necessary and providing tax information to borrowers  when applicable  The servicing fee is typically a portion of the mortgage rate  The  other administrative fees are those charged by the issuer or financial guarantor of the  mortgage pass  through security for guaranteeing the issue  A mortgage pass  through security  s coupon rate is called the pass  through rate   The pass  through rate is lower than the mortgage rate on the underlying pool of  mortgages by an amount equal to the servicing and other administrative fees   The  pass  through rate that the investor receives is said to be  net interest  or  net coupon   Not all of the mortgages that are included in a pool of securitized mortgages have  the same mortgage rate and the same maturity  Consequently for each mortgage  pass  through security a weighted average coupon rate  WAC  and a weighted  average maturity  WAM  are determined  The WAC is calculated by weighting the  mortgage rate of each mortgage in the pool by the percentage of the outstanding  mortgage balance relative to the outstanding amount of all the mortgages in the pool   Similarly the WAM is calculated by weighting the remaining number of months to  maturity of each mortgage in the pool by the outstanding mortgage balance relative  to the outstanding amount of all the mortgages in the pool  Example   illustrates the  calculation of the WAC and WAM

15,503,      Prepayment Risk
16,503,An investor who owns mortgage pass  through securities does not know what the  future cash flows will be because these future cash flows depend on actual prepay  ments   As we noted earlier this risk is called prepayment risk   This prepayment risk  has two components   contraction risk and extension risk  both of which largely reflect  changes in the general level of interest rates   Contraction risk is the risk that when interest rates decline actual prepayments will  be higher than forecasted because homeowners will refinance at now  available lower  interest rates   Thus  a security backed by mortgages will have a shorter maturity than  was anticipated at the time of purchase  Holding a security whose maturity becomes  shorter when interest rates decline has two adverse consequences for investors   First   investors must reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates   Second if the security  is prepayable or callable its price appreciation is not as great as that of an otherwise  identical bond that does not have a prepayment or call option  In contrast  extension risk is the risk that when interest rates rise prepayments  will be lower than forecasted because homeowners are reluctant to give up the ben  efits of a contractual interest rate that now looks low  As a result  a security backed  by mortgages will typically have a longer maturity than was anticipated at the time of  purchase  From the investors  perspective the value of the security has fallen because  the higher interest rates translate into a lower price for the security and the income  investors receive  and can potentially reinvest  is typically limited to the interest  payment and scheduled principal repayments  
17,503,      Prepayment Rate Measures
18,503,In describing prepayments  market participants refer to the prepayment rate or  prepayment speed  The two key prepayment rate measures are the single monthly  mortality rate  SMM  a monthly measure and its corresponding annualized rate the  conditional prepayment rate  CPR  
1,504,Residential Mortgage  Backed Securities
2,504,   
3,504,The SMM reflects the dollar amount of prepayment for the month as a fraction of  the balance on the mortgage after accounting for the scheduled principal repayment  for the month  It is calculated as follows  
4,504,SMM
5,504, 
6,504,Prepayment for the month Beginning outstanding mortgage   balance for the month Scheduled principal repayment for  tthe month
7,504, 
8,504,     
9,504,     
10,504,   
11,504,Note that the SMM is typically expressed as a percentage  When market participants describe the assumed prepayment for a pool of resi  dential mortgages  they refer to the annualized SMM which is the CPR   A CPR of     for example means that approximately    of the outstanding mortgage balance  at the beginning of the year is expected to be prepaid by the end of the year  A key factor in the valuation of a mortgage pass  through security and other  products derived from a pool of mortgages is forecasting the future prepayment rate   This task involves prepayment modeling   Prepayment modeling uses characteristics  of the mortgage pool and other factors to develop a statistical model for forecasting  future prepayments   In the United States  market participants describe prepayment rates in terms of  a prepayment pattern or benchmark over the life of a mortgage pool  This pattern is  the Public Securities Association  PSA  prepayment benchmark  which is produced  by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  SIFMA   The PSA  prepayment benchmark is expressed as a series of monthly prepayment rates   Based  on historical patterns  it assumes that prepayment rates are low for newly originated  mortgages and then speed up as the mortgages become seasoned  Slower or faster  prepayment rates are then referred to as some percentage of the PSA prepayment  benchmark   Rather than going into the details of the PSA prepayment benchmark  this  discussion will rely on some PSA assumptions   What is important to remember is that  the standard for the PSA model is     PSA  that is  at     PSA  investors can expect  prepayments to follow the PSA prepayment benchmark for example an increase of  prepayment rates of       for the first    months until they peak at    in Month      A PSA assumption greater than     PSA means that prepayments are assumed to be  faster than the standard model  In contrast  a PSA assumption lower than     PSA  means that prepayments are assumed to be slower than the standard model 
12,504,      Cash Flow Construction
13,504,Let us see how to construct the monthly cash flow for a hypothetical mortgage pass   through security  We assume the following     The underlying pool of mortgages has a par value of US     million     The mortgages are fixed  rate level  payment  and fully amortizing loans      The WAC for the mortgages in the pool is        The WAM for the mortgages in the pool is     months      The pass  through rate is       Exhibit   shows the cash flows to the mortgage pass  through security holders for  selected months assuming a prepayment rate of     PSA   The SMM in Column    and mortgage payments in Column   are given  The net interest payment in Column    is the amount available to pay security holders after servicing and other adminis  trative fees   This amount is equal to the beginning outstanding mortgage balance in  Column   multiplied by the pass  through rate of      and then divided by     The  scheduled principal repayment in Column   is the difference between the mortgage  payment in Column   and the gross interest payment   The gross interest payment is  equal to the beginning outstanding mortgage balance in Column   multiplied by the  WAC of    and then divided by     The prepayment in Column   is calculated by

4,506,A standard practice in the bond market is to refer to the maturity of a bond  This  practice is not followed for MBS because principal repayments  scheduled princi  pal repayments and prepayments  are made over the life of the security  Although  an MBS has a  legal maturity  which is the date when the last scheduled principal  repayment is due the legal maturity does not reveal much about the actual principal  repayments and the interest rate risk associated with the MBS  For example a      year option  free corporate bond and an MBS with a     year legal maturity with the  same coupon rate are not equivalent in terms of interest rate risk   Effective duration  can be calculated for both the corporate bond and the MBS to assess the sensitivity  of the securities to interest rate movements   But a measure widely used by market  participants for MBS is the weighted average life or simply the average life of the  MBS  This measure gives investors an indication of how long they can expect to hold  the MBS before it is paid off assuming interest rates stay at current levels and thus   expected prepayments are realized  In other words  the average life of the MBS is the  convention  based average time to receipt of all the projected principal repayments   scheduled principal repayments and projected prepayments   A mortgage pass  through security  s average life depends on the prepayment  assumption as illustrated in the following table  This table provides the average life  of the mortgage pass  through security used in Exhibit   for various prepayment rates    Note that at the assumed prepayment rate of     PSA  the mortgage pass  through  security has an average life of     years   The average life extends when the prepay  ment rate goes down and contracts rapidly as the prepayment rate goes up  So at a  prepayment rate of     PSA  the average life of the mortgage pass  through security  is only     years

5,507,C
6,507,Solution to   
7,507,B is correct   A non  conforming mortgage is one that does not satisfy the under  writing standards for inclusion as collateral for an agency RMBS  The standards  specify the maximum size of the loan the loan documentation required the  maximum loan  to  value ratio and whether or not insurance is required for the  loans in the pool 
8,507,Solution to   
9,507,B is correct  The monthly cash flows of a mortgage pass  through security depend  on the cash flows of the underlying pool of mortgages  but their amount and  timing cannot be known with certainty because of prepayments   When inter  est rates decline borrowers are likely to prepay all or part of their outstanding  mortgage balance which will affect the monthly cash flows of the mortgage  pass  through security  Remember that the fees related to servicing and guaran  teeing the mortgages reduce the monthly cash flows of a mortgage pass  through  security relative to those of the underlying pool of mortgages  
10,507,Solution to   
11,507,C is correct   A prepayment rate of    PSA means that investors can expect the  prepayment rate of the mortgages included in the collateral backing the mortgage  pass  through security to be     of the monthly prepayment rates forecasted by  the PSA model  For example if the PSA model forecasts an increase in prepay  ment rates of       for the first    months until they peak at    in Month        PSA would assume an increase in prepayment rates of                      for the first    months until they peak at                  in Month     Thus   investors can expect slower prepayments than the PSA prepayment benchmark  
12,507,Solution to   
13,507,C is correct   When interest rates decline the prepayment rate on a mortgage  pass  through security goes up because homeowners refinance at now  available  lower interest rates   As a result  investors face contraction risk   that is  they  receive payments faster than anticipated  Investors who decide to retain the  security face the prospect of having to reinvest those payments at relatively low  interest rates   Investors who decide to sell the security would have to do so at a  price lower than that of an otherwise identical bond with no prepayment option  and thus no prepayment risk

3,508,    Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
4,508,As noted in the previous section prepayment risk is an important consideration  when investing in mortgage pass  through securities   Some institutional investors are  concerned with extension risk and others with contraction risk   The structuring of a  securitization can help redistribute the cash flows of mortgage  related products  mort  gage pass  through securities or pools of loans  to different bond classes or tranches   which leads to the creation of securities that have different exposures to prepayment  risk and thus different risk return patterns relative to the mortgage  related product  from which they were created  When the cash flows of mortgage  related products are redistributed to various  tranches  the resulting securities are called collateralized mortgage obligations   CMOs   The mortgage  related products from which the cash flows are obtained are  considered the collateral  Note that in contrast to a mortgage pass  through security  the collateral is not a pool of mortgages but a mortgage pass  through security  In fact   in practice the collateral is usually a pool of mortgage pass  through securities hence  the reason market participants sometimes use the terms  collateral  and  mortgage  pass  through securities  interchangeably  The creation of a CMO cannot eliminate or change prepayment risk   it can only  distribute the various forms of this risk among different bond classes   The CMO s  major financial innovation is that securities can be created to closely satisfy the asset  liability needs of institutional investors  thereby broadening the appeal of mortgage   backed products   A wide range of CMO structures exists   The major ones are reviewed in the fol  lowing subsections  
5,508,      Sequential  Pay CMO Structures
6,508,The first CMO was structured so that each tranche would be retired sequentially  Such  structures are called  sequential  pay CMOs    The rule for the monthly distribution  of the principal repayments  scheduled principal repayment plus prepayments  to  the tranches in this structure is as follows   First  distribute all principal payments to  Tranche   until the principal balance for Tranche   is zero  After Tranche   is paid off  distribute all principal payments to Tranche   until the principal balance for Tranche    is zero  And so on  To illustrate a sequential  pay CMO let us use a hypothetical transaction called  CMO      Assume that the collateral for CMO     is the mortgage pass  through  security described in Exhibit   in Section        Recall that the total par value of the  collateral is US     million the pass  through coupon rate is      the WAC is     and the WAM is     months   From this US     million of collateral four tranches are  created as shown in Exhibit    In this simple structure the coupon rate is the same  for each tranche and also the same as the mortgage pass  through security  s coupon  rate  This feature is for simplicity   typically the coupon rate varies by tranche   
7,508,   Keep in mind that the coupon rate for a tranche is affected by the term structure of interest rates  that  is  basically the yield curve   Typically yield increases as maturity increases   A CMO has tranches with  different average lives   Usually the longer the average life the higher the coupon rate should be  So in  the hypothetical four  tranche sequential  pay structure shown in Exhibit   Tranche A might have a       coupon rate Tranche B a      coupon rate Tranche C a      coupon rate and Tranche D a      coupon  rate  In any event  investors evaluate each tranche on the basis of its perceived risk and price it accordingly   Consequently investors pay a price for the tranche that reflects the yield they expect to receive given the  particular coupon rate  Separately the difference between the coupon rate paid by the underlying pool of  mortgages net of servicing and other administrative fees  that is  the net coupon      in our example   and the coupon rate paid to each of the tranches that has a coupon rate of less than the net coupon is used  to create securities called  structured interest  only tranches    A discussion of these tranches is beyond the  scope of this reading

12,509,Payment rules   For payment of monthly coupon interest   Disburse monthly coupon interest to each  tranche on the basis of the amount of principal outstanding for each tranche at the beginning of the  month  For disbursement of principal payments   Disburse principal payments to Tranche A until it is  completely paid off  After Tranche A is completely paid off disburse principal payments to Tranche  B until it is completely paid off  After Tranche B is completely paid off disburse principal payments  to Tranche C until it is completely paid off  After Tranche C is completely paid off disburse principal  payments to Tranche D until it is completely paid off 
13,509,Remember that a CMO is created by redistributing the cash flows interest pay  ments and principal repayments to the various tranches on the basis of a set of pay  ment rules   The payment rules at the bottom of Exhibit   describe how the cash flows  from the mortgage pass  through security are to be distributed to the four tranches    CMO     has separate rules for the interest payment and the principal repayment   the latter being the sum of the scheduled principal repayment and the prepayments   Although the payment rules for the distribution of the principal repayments are  known the precise amount of the principal repayment in each month is not   This  amount will depend on the cash flow of the collateral which depends on the actual  prepayment rate of the collateral  The assumed prepayment rate      PSA in Exhibit     allows determining only the projected not the actual cash flow  Consider what has been accomplished by creating the sequential  pay CMO      structure  Earlier we saw that with a prepayment rate of     PSA  the mortgage pass   through security  s average life was     years   Exhibit   reports the average life of the  collateral and the four tranches assuming various actual prepayment rates   Note that  the four tranches have average lives that are shorter or longer than the collateral  thereby attracting investors who have preferences for different average lives   For  example a pension fund that needs cash only after a few years because it expects a  significant increase in the number of retirements after that time may opt for a tranche  with a longer average life

3,510,A major problem that remains is the considerable variability of the average lives  of the tranches   How this problem can be handled is shown in the next section but  at this point  note that some protection against prepayment risk is provided for each  tranche  The protection arises because prioritizing the distribution of principal  that  is  establishing the payment rule for the principal repayment  effectively protects the  shorter  term tranche  A in this structure  against extension risk   This protection must  come from somewhere  it actually comes from the longer  term tranches   Similarly  Tranches C and D provide protection against extension risk for Tranches A and B   At the same time Tranches C and D benefit because they are provided protection  against contraction risk   this protection comes from Tranches A and B  Thus  the  sequential  pay CMO     structure allows investors concerned about extension risk  to invest in Tranches A or B and those concerned about contraction risk to invest in  Tranches C or D 
4,510,      CMO Structures Including Planned Amortization Class and Support Tranches
5,510,A common structure in CMOs is to include planned amortization class  PAC   tranches which offer greater predictability of the cash flows as long as the prepayment  rate is within a specified band over the collateral s life  Remember that the creation of  an MBS whether it is a mortgage pass  through or a CMO cannot make prepayment  risk disappear  So where does the reduction of prepayment risk  both extension risk  and contraction risk  that PAC tranches offer investors come from  The answer is  that it comes from the existence of non  PAC tranches  called support tranches or  companion tranches   The structure of the CMO makes the support tranches absorb  prepayment risk first  Because PAC tranches have limited  but not complete  protection  against both extension risk and contraction risk  they are said to provide two  sided  prepayment protection  The greater predictability of the cash flows for the PAC tranches occurs because  a principal repayment schedule must be satisfied  As long as the prepayment rate is  within the specified band called the PAC band all prepayment risk is absorbed by  the support tranche  If the collateral prepayments are slower than forecasted the sup  port tranches do not receive any principal repayment until the PAC tranches receive  their scheduled principal repayment   This rule reduces the extension risk of the PAC  tranches   Similarly if the collateral prepayments are faster than forecasted the sup  port tranches absorb any principal repayments in excess of the scheduled principal  repayments   This rule reduces the contraction risk of the PAC tranches   Even if the  prepayment rate is outside the PAC band prepayment risk is first absorbed by the  support tranche  Thus  the key to the prepayment protection that PAC tranches offer  investors is the amount of support tranches outstanding   If the support tranches are  paid off quickly because of faster  than  expected prepayments  they no longer provide  any protection for the PAC tranches   Support tranches expose investors to the highest level of prepayment risk   Therefore  investors must be particularly careful in assessing the cash flow characteristics of  support tranches in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse portfolio consequences  resulting from prepayments   To illustrate how to create CMO structures including PAC and support tranches   we use again the US     million mortgage pass  through security described in Exhibit    in Section       with a pass  through coupon rate of      a WAC of    and a WAM  of     months as collateral  The creation of PAC tranches requires the specification  of two PSA prepayment rates   a lower PSA prepayment assumption and an upper  PSA prepayment assumption  The lower and upper PSA prepayment assumptions are  called the  initial PAC collar  or the  initial PAC band   The PAC collar for a CMO  is typically dictated by market conditions   In our example we assume that the lower  and upper PSA prepayment assumptions are     PSA and     PSA  respectively so  the initial PAC collar is         PSA

13,511,Exhibit    reports the average life of the PAC and support tranches in CMO      assuming various actual prepayment rates   Note that between     PSA and     PSA   the average life of the PAC tranche is constant at     years   At slower or faster PSA  rates  however the schedule is broken and the average life changes extending when  the prepayment rate is less than     PSA and contracting when it is greater than      PSA   Even so there is much less variability for the average life of the PAC tranche  compared with that of the support tranche

21,511,Most CMO structures including PAC and support tranches have more than  one PAC tranche  A sequence of six PAC tranches  that is  PAC tranches paid off  in sequence as specified by a principal repayment schedule  is not uncommon  For  example consider CMO     in Exhibit   which contains four sequential PAC tranches   P  A  P  B P  C  and P  D  and one support tranche  The total par amount of the PAC  and support tranches is the same as for CMO     in Exhibit    The difference is that  instead of one PAC tranche with a schedule there are four PAC tranches with sched  ules   As described in the payment rules  the PAC tranches are paid off in sequence

12,512,      Other CMO Structures
13,512,Often there is a demand for tranches that have a floating rate  Although the collateral  pays a fixed rate it is possible to create a tranche with a floating rate  This is done by  constructing a floater and an inverse floater combination from any of the fixed  rate  tranches in the CMO structure  Because the floating  rate tranche pays a higher rate  when interest rates go up and the inverse floater pays a lower rate when interest rates  go up they offset each other  Thus  a fixed  rate tranche can be used to satisfy the  demand for a floating  rate tranche  In a similar vein other types of tranches to satisfy the various needs of investors  are possible

4,513,Solution to   
5,513,C is correct   CMOs are created by redistributing the cash flows of mortgage   related products  including mortgage pass  through securities  to different bond  classes or tranches on the basis of a set of payment rules  
6,513,Solution to   
7,513,A is correct  The purpose of creating different bond classes in a CMO is to provide  a risk return profile that is more suitable to investors than the risk  return profile  of the mortgage pass  through securities from which the CMO is created  The  PAC tranche has considerably less variability in average life than the mortgage  pass  through securities   In contrast  the support tranche has more variability  in average life than the mortgage pass  through securities  
8,513,Solution to   
9,513,B is correct   Contraction risk is the risk that when interest rates decline pre  payments will be higher than expected and the security  s maturity will become  shorter than was anticipated at the time of purchase  PAC tranches offer investors  protection against contraction risk  and extension risk   The PAC tranche that is  most suitable for an investor concerned about contraction risk is P  D because  it is the latest  payment PAC tranche  that is  any principal repayments in excess  of the scheduled principal repayments are absorbed sequentially by the support  tranche then P  A  P  B and finally P  D 
10,513,Solution to   
11,513,B is correct   The tranche of a CMO that is most suitable for an investor who  expects a fall in interest rates is an inverse floating  rate tranche  The inverse  floater pays a coupon rate that is inversely related to prevailing interest rates    Thus  if interest rates fall the CMO s coupon rate will rise 
12,513,Solution to   
13,513,B is correct   The investment that is most suitable to an investor who is willing  and able to accept significant prepayment risk is the support tranche of a col  lateralized mortgage obligation  Because the PAC tranche has a stable average  life at prepayment rates within the PAC band all prepayment risk is absorbed  by the support tranche for prepayment rates within the band  Even at rates
1,514,Commercial Mortgage  Backed Securities
2,514,   
3,514,outside the PAC band prepayment risk is first absorbed by the support tranche   Investors will be compensated for bearing prepayment risk in the sense that  if  properly priced the support tranche will have a higher expected rate of return  than the PAC tranche 
4,514,    Non  agency Residential Mortgage  Backed Securities
5,514,Agency RMBS are those issued by Ginnie Mae Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  RMBS  issued by any other entity are non  agency RMBS  Entities that issue non  agency RMBS  are typically thrift institutions  commercial banks  and private conduits   Private con  duits may purchase non  conforming mortgages  pool them and then sell mortgage  pass  through securities whose collateral is the underlying pool of non  conforming  mortgages   Because they are not guaranteed by the government or by a GSE  credit  risk is an important consideration when investing in non  agency RMBS  Non  agency RMBS share many features and structuring techniques with agency  CMOs   However because non  agency RMBS are not guaranteed by the US govern  ment or by a GSE that can provide protection against losses in the pool some form  of internal or external credit enhancement is necessary to make these securities  attractive to investors   These credit enhancements allow investors to reduce credit  risk or transfer credit risk between bond classes  thus enabling investors to choose  the risk return profile that best suits their needs   Credit enhancements also play an  important role in obtaining favorable credit ratings  which make non  agency RMBS  more marketable to investors   The level of credit enhancement is usually determined  relative to a specific credit rating desired by the issuer for a security  Note that one of  the consequences of the           credit crisis has been an overall increase in the  level of credit enhancement   As mentioned in Section     subordination or credit tranching  is a common  form of credit enhancement   The subordination levels  that is  the amount of credit  protection for a bond class  are set at the time of issuance  However the subordina  tion levels change over time as voluntary prepayments and defaults occur  To protect  investors in non  agency RMBS a securitization is designed to keep the amount of  credit enhancement from deteriorating over time  If the credit enhancement for senior  tranches deteriorates because of poor performance of the collateral a mechanism  called the  shifting interest mechanism  locks out subordinated bond classes from  receiving payments for a period of time  Many non  agency RMBS also include other  credit enhancements  such as overcollateralization and reserve accounts   When forecasting the future cash flows of non  agency RMBS investors must con  sider two important components   The first is the assumed default rate for the collateral   The second is the recovery rate because even though the collateral may default  not  all of the outstanding mortgage balance may be lost  The repossession and subsequent  sale of the recovered property may provide cash flows that will be available to pay  bondholders   That amount is based on the assumed amount that will be recovered  The focus in Section   is on securities backed by a pool of residential mortgages    The next section discusses securities backed by a pool of commercial mortgages

4,515,    Credit Risk
5,515,In the United States and other countries where commercial mortgages are non  recourse  loans  the lender can look only to the income  producing property backing the loan  for interest payments and principal repayments   If a default occurs  the lender can  foreclose the commercial property but it can only use the proceeds from the sale  of that property to recover the principal outstanding  and it has no recourse to the  borrower  s other assets and or income for any unpaid balance  The lender must view  each property individually and lenders evaluate each property using measures that  have been found useful in assessing credit risk   Two measures that have been found to be key indicators of potential credit per  formance are the loan  to  value ratio  LTV   which was discussed in Section   and the  debt  service  coverage  DSC  ratio sometimes referred to as DSCR   The DSC ratio is  equal to the property  s annual net operating income  NOI  divided by the debt service   that is  the annual amount of interest payments and principal repayments   The NOI  is defined as the rental income reduced by cash operating expenses and a non  cash  replacement reserve reflecting the depreciation of the property over time  A DSC  ratio that exceeds     indicates that the cash flows from the property are sufficient  to cover the debt service while maintaining the property in its initial state of repair   The higher the DSC ratio the more likely it is that the borrower will be able to meet  debt  servicing requirements from the property  s cash flows

7,515,A credit  rating agency determines the level of credit enhancement necessary to  achieve a desired credit rating   For example if specific loan  to  value and DSC ratios  are needed and those ratios cannot be met at the loan level subordination is used to  achieve the desired credit rating   Interest on the principal outstanding is paid to all tranches   Losses arising from loan  defaults are charged against the outstanding principal balance of the CMBS tranche  with the lowest priority  This tranche may not be rated by credit  rating agencies   in  this case this unrated tranche is called the  first  loss piece   residual tranche  or   equity tranche   The total loss charged includes the amount previously advanced and  the actual loss incurred in the sale of the loan s underlying property  Two characteristics that are usually specific to CMBS structures are the presence  of a call protection and a balloon maturity provision 
8,515,      Call Protection
9,515,A critical investment feature that distinguishes CMBS from RMBS is the protection  against early prepayments available to investors  known as a call protection  An investor  in an RMBS is exposed to considerable prepayment risk because the borrower has the  right to prepay a loan in whole or in part  before the scheduled principal repayment  date  As explained in Section     a borrower in the United States usually does not pay  any penalty for prepayment   The discussion of CMOs highlighted how investors can  purchase certain types of tranches  e g   sequential  pay and PAC tranches  to modify  or reduce prepayment risk   With CMBS investors have considerable call protection  In fact  it is this protec  tion that results in CMBS trading in the market more like corporate bonds than like  RMBS  The call protection comes either at the structure level or at the loan level 
1,516,Commercial Mortgage  Backed Securities
2,516,   
3,516,Structural call protection is achieved when CMBS are structured to have sequential   pay tranches  by credit rating   A lower  rated tranche cannot be paid down until the  higher  rated tranche is completely retired so the AAA rated bonds must be paid off  before the AA rated bonds are and so on  Principal losses resulting from defaults   however are affected from the bottom of the structure upward  At the loan level four mechanisms offer investors call protection     A prepayment lockout  which is a contractual agreement that prohibits any  prepayments during a specified period of time     Prepayment penalty points  which are predetermined penalties that a borrower  who wants to refinance must pay to do so a point is equal to    of the out  standing loan balance     A yield maintenance charge also called a  make  whole charge  which is a  penalty paid by the borrower that makes refinancing solely to get a lower  mortgage rate uneconomical for the borrower  In its simplest terms  a yield  maintenance charge is designed to make the lender indifferent as to the timing  of prepayments      Defeasance for which the borrower provides sufficient funds for the servicer to  invest in a portfolio of government securities that replicates the cash flows that  would exist in the absence of prepayments   The cash payments that must be  met by the borrower are projected on the basis of the terms of the loan  Then a  portfolio of government securities is constructed in such a way that the interest  payments and the principal repayments from the portfolio will be sufficient to  pay off each obligation when it comes due  When the last obligation is paid off  the value of the portfolio is zero  that is  there are no funds remaining   The  cost of assembling such a portfolio is the cost of defeasing the loan that must be  repaid by the issuer   
4,516,      Balloon Maturity Provision
5,516,Many commercial loans backing CMBS are balloon loans that require a substantial  principal repayment at maturity of the loan  If the borrower fails to make the balloon  payment  the borrower is in default   The lender may extend the loan over a period  of time called the  workout period   In doing so the lender may modify the original  terms of the loan and charge a higher interest rate called the  default interest rate   during the workout period  The risk that a borrower will not be able to make the balloon payment because  either the borrower cannot arrange for refinancing or cannot sell the property to  generate sufficient funds to pay off the outstanding principal balance is called  balloon  risk    Because the life of the loan is extended by the lender during the workout period  balloon risk is a type of extension risk  
6,516,   This portfolio strategy for paying off liabilities is used by insurance companies   In the United States  it  has also been used by municipal bond issuers   the resulting bonds are referred to as  pre  refunded bonds

13,517,  Based on the information provided this CMBS  A does not include any credit enhancement    B  includes an internal credit enhancement   C  includes an external credit enhancement     Based on the information provided investors in this CMBS have prepay  ment protection at   A  the loan level   B  the structure level  C both the loan and structure levels     Defeasance can be best described as   A a predetermined penalty that a borrower who wants to refinance must  pay to do so

4,518,B a contractual agreement that prohibits any prepayments during a  specified period of time   funds that the borrower must provide to replicate the cash flows that  would exist in the absence of prepayments     A risk that investors typically face when holding CMBS is   A call risk B balloon risk   C contraction risk     The credit risk of a commercial mortgage  backed security is lower   A  the lower the DSC ratio and the lower the LTV  B  the lower the DSC ratio and the higher the LTV  C  the higher the DSC ratio and the lower the LTV 
5,518,Solution to   
6,518,B is correct   The CMBS includes a senior subordinated structure which is a  form of internal credit enhancement   Class B provides protection for all of the  bond classes listed above it   Similarly Class C provides protection for all other  bond classes  including Class B  it is the first  loss piece also called the residual  tranche or equity tranche  Note that because it is the residual tranche Class C  has no specific pass  through rate  Investors in Class C will price it on the basis  of some expected residual rate of return but they could do better or worse than  expected depending on how interest rate movements and default rates affect  the performance of the other tranches  
7,518,Solution to   
8,518,C is correct   This CMBS offers investors prepayment protection at both the  structure and loan levels   The structural call protection is achieved thanks to the  sequential  pay tranches   At the loan level the CMBS includes three of the four  types of call protection namely a prepayment lockout  a yield maintenance  charge and defeasance 
9,518,Solution to   
10,518,C is correct   Defeasance is a call protection at the loan level that requires the  borrower to provide sufficient funds for the servicer to invest in a portfolio  of government securities that replicates the cash flows that would exist in the  absence of prepayments  
11,518,Solution to   
12,518,B is correct   Because many commercial loans backing CMBS require a balloon  payment  investors in CMBS typically face balloon risk that is  the risk that if  the borrower cannot arrange for refinancing or cannot sell the property to make  the balloon payment  the CMBS may extend in maturity because the lender has  to wait to obtain the outstanding principal until the borrower can make the  balloon amount   Balloon risk is a type of extension risk  
13,518,Solution to   
14,518,C is correct   The DSC ratio and the LTV are key indicators of potential credit  performance and thus allow investors to assess the credit risk of a CMBS  The  DSC ratio is equal to the property  s annual NOI divided by the annual amount  of interest payments and principal repayments   So the higher the DSC ratio the
1,519,   
2,519,Reading      Introduction to Asset  Backed Securities
3,519, 
4,519,lower the CMBS s credit risk   The LTV is equal to the amount of the mortgage  divided by the property  s value  So the lower the LTV the lower the CMBS s  credit risk

6,519,NON  MORTGAGE ASSET  BACKED SECURITIES
7,519,Numerous types of non  mortgage assets have been used as collateral in securitization   The largest in most countries are auto loan and lease receivables  credit card receiv  ables  personal loans  and commercial loans   What is important to keep in mind is  that  regardless of the type of asset  ABS that are not guaranteed by a government or  a quasi  government entity are subject to credit risk   ABS can be categorized on the basis of the way the collateral repays that is   whether the collateral is amortizing or non  amortizing   Traditional residential mort  gages and auto loans are examples of amortizing loans   The cash flows for an amortizing  loan include interest payments  scheduled principal repayments and any prepayments   if permissible  If the loan has no schedule for paying down the principal it is a non   amortizing loan  Because a non  amortizing loan does not involve scheduled principal  repayments  an ABS backed by non  amortizing loans is not affected by prepayment risk    Credit card receivable ABS are an example of ABS backed by non  amortizing loans   Consider an ABS backed by a pool of      amortizing loans with a total par value  of US     million  Over time some of the loans will be paid off   the amounts received  from the scheduled principal repayment and any prepayments will be distributed  to the bond classes on the basis of the payment rule  Consequently over time the  number of loans in the collateral will drop from      and the total par value will fall  to less than US     million  Now what happens if the collateral of the ABS is      non  amortizing loans   Some of these loans will be paid off in whole or in part before the maturity of the  ABS  When those loans are paid off what happens depends on whether the loans were  paid off during the lockout period or after it   The lockout period or revolving period  is the period during which the principal repaid is reinvested to acquire additional  loans with a principal equal to the principal repaid  The reinvestment in new loans  can result in the collateral including more or less than      loans  but the loans will  still have a total par value of US     million  When the lockout period is over any  principal that is repaid will not be used to reinvest in new loans but will instead be  distributed to the bond classes   This reading cannot cover all types of non  mortgage ABS  It focuses on the two  popular non  mortgage ABS in most countries   auto loan ABS and credit card receiv  able ABS 
8,519,    Auto Loan ABS
9,519,Auto loan ABS are backed by auto loans and lease receivables   The focus in this section  is on the largest type of auto securitizations that is  auto loan  backed securities   In  some countries  auto loan  backed securities represent the largest or second largest  sector of the securitization market  
1,520,Non  Mortgage Asset  Backed Securities
2,520,   
3,520,The cash flows for auto loan  backed securities consist of scheduled monthly  payments  that is  interest payments and scheduled principal repayments  and any  prepayments   For securities backed by auto loans  prepayments result from sales  and trade  ins requiring full payoff of the loan repossession and subsequent resale  of autos  insurance proceeds received upon loss or destruction of autos  and early  payoffs of the loans   All auto loan  backed securities have some form of credit enhancement  often a  senior subordinated structure  In addition many auto loan  backed securities come  with overcollateralization and a reserve account often an excess spread account  Recall  from a previous reading that the excess spread sometimes called excess interest cash  flow is an amount that can be retained and deposited into a reserve account and that  can serve as a first line of protection against losses   To illustrate the typical structure of auto loan  backed securities  let us use the  example of securities issued by Fideicomiso Financiero Autos VI  The collateral is a  pool of     auto loans denominated in Argentine pesos  ARS  The loans were originated  by BancoFinansur  The structure of the securitization includes three bond classes

6,522,Solution to   
7,522,A is correct   The amount of the loss  US    million  is lower than the combined  amount of overcollateralization and the reserve account  US              US             US            Therefore none of the classes of notes will  incur losses  
8,522,Solution to   
9,522,A is correct   Once the amount of losses exceeds the amount of protection pro  vided by the overcollateralization and the reserve account  losses are absorbed  by the bond classes   Because it is a sequential  pay structure Class E notes are  the first ones to absorb losses  up to the principal amount of US           It  means that there is still US          to be absorbed by another bond class   which would be the Class D notes  
10,522,    Credit Card Receivable ABS
11,522,When a purchase is made on a credit card the issuer of the credit card  the lender   extends credit to the cardholder  the borrower   Credit cards are issued by banks   credit card companies  retailers  and travel and entertainment companies   At the time  of purchase the cardholder agrees to repay the amount borrowed  that is  the cost of  the item purchased  plus any applicable finance charges   The amount that the card  holder agrees to pay the issuer of the credit card is a receivable from the perspective  of the issuer of the credit card  Credit card receivables are used as collateral for the  issuance of credit card receivable ABS  For a pool of credit card receivables  the cash flows consist of finance charges  collected fees  and principal repayments   Finance charges collected represent the  periodic interest the credit card borrower is charged on the unpaid balance after  the grace period  The interest rate may be fixed or floating   The floating rate may be  capped  that is  it may have an upper limit because some countries have usury rate  laws that impose a cap on interest rates   Fees include late payment fees and any annual  membership fees   Interest is paid to holders of credit card receivable ABS periodically  e g   monthly  quarterly or semiannually   As noted earlier the collateral of credit card receivable  ABS is a pool of non  amortizing loans   These loans have lockout periods during which  the cash flows that are paid out to security holders are based only on finance charges  collected and fees   When the lockout period is over the principal that is repaid by the  cardholders is no longer reinvested but instead is distributed to investors

7,523,Credit card receivable asset  backed securities  ABS  differ from auto loan ABS  in the following way   A credit card loans are recourse loans  whereas auto loans are non  recourse  loans   the collateral for credit card receivable  backed securities is a pool of non   amortizing loans  whereas the collateral for auto loan ABS is a pool of  amortizing loans    C credit card receivable  backed securities have regular principal repay  ments  whereas auto loan ABS include a lockout period during which the  cash proceeds from principal repayments are reinvested in additional loan  receivables  
8,523,Solution 
9,523,B is correct   A main difference between credit card receivable ABS and auto  loan ABS is the type of loans that back the securities   For credit card receivable  ABS the collateral is a pool of non  amortizing loans   During the lockout period  the cash proceeds from principal repayments are reinvested in additional credit  card receivables   When the lockout period is over principal repayments are  used to pay off the outstanding principal  For auto loan  backed securities  the  collateral is a pool of amortizing loans   Security holders receive regular principal  repayments   As a result  the outstanding principal balance declines over time

11,523,COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS
12,523,Collateralized debt obligation  CDO  is a generic term used to describe a security  backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations  CDOs backed by corporate  and emerging market bonds are collateralized bond obligations  CBOs   CDOs backed

4,524,    CDO Structure
5,524,A CDO involves the creation of an SPE   In a CDO there is a need for a CDO manager  also called  collateral manager  to buy and sell debt obligations for and from the  CDO s collateral  that is  the portfolio of assets  to generate sufficient cash flows to  meet the obligations to the CDO bondholders   The funds to purchase the collateral assets for a CDO are obtained from the issuance  of debt obligations   These debt obligations are bond classes or tranches and include  senior bond classes  mezzanine bond classes  that is  bond classes with credit ratings  between senior and subordinated bond classes  and subordinated bond classes  often  referred to as the residual or equity tranches   The motivation for investors to invest in  senior or mezzanine bond classes is to earn a potentially higher yield than that on a  comparably rated corporate bond by gaining exposure to debt products that they may  not otherwise be able to purchase  Investors in equity tranches have the potential to  earn an equity  type return thereby offsetting the increased risk from investing in the  subordinated class   The key to whether or not a CDO is viable is whether a structure  can be created that offers a competitive return for the subordinated tranche  The basic economics of the CDO is that the funds are raised by the sale of the bond  classes and the CDO manager invests those funds in assets   The CDO manager seeks  to earn a rate of return higher than the aggregate cost of the bond classes   The return  in excess of what is paid out to the bond classes accrues to the holders of the equity  tranche and to the CDO manager  In other words  a CDO is a leveraged transaction  in which those who invest in the equity tranche use borrowed funds  the bond classes  issued  to generate a return above the funding cost   As with ABS each CDO bond class is structured to provide a specific level of risk  for investors   The CDO is constructed so as to impose restrictions on the CDO man  ager via various tests and limits that must be satisfied for the CDO to meet investors   varying risk appetites while still providing adequate protection for the senior bond  class   If the CDO manager fails pre  specified tests  a provision is triggered that requires  the payoff of the principal to the senior bond class until the tests are satisfied  This  process effectively deleverages the CDO because the cheapest funding source for the  CDO the senior bond class  is reduced  The ability of the CDO manager to make the interest payments and principal  repayments depends on the performance of the collateral  The proceeds to meet the  obligations to the CDO bond classes can come from one or more of the following  sources   interest payments from collateral assets  maturing of collateral assets  and  sale of collateral assets   The cash flows and credit risks of a CDO are best illustrated  by an example 
6,524,    An Example of a CDO Transaction
7,524,Although various motivations may prompt a sponsor to create a CDO the following  example uses a CDO for which the purpose is to capture what market participants  mistakenly label a CDO arbitrage transaction  The term  arbitrage  is not used here  in the traditional sense that is  a risk  free transaction that earns an expected posi  tive net profit but requires no net investment of money  In this context  arbitrage is  used in a loose sense to describe a transaction in which the motivation is to capture  a spread between the return that could potentially be earned on the collateral and  the funding cost

4,527,   Securitization involves pooling debt obligations  such as loans or receivables   and creating securities backed by the pool of debt obligations called asset   backed securities  ABS   The cash flows of the debt obligations are used to make  interest payments and principal repayments to the holders of the ABS     Securitization has several benefits   It allows investors direct access to liquid  investments and payment streams that would be unattainable if all the financing  were performed through banks   It enables banks to increase loan originations at  economic scales greater than if they used only their own in  house loan port  folios   Thus  securitization contributes to lower costs of borrowing for entities  raising funds  higher risk  adjusted returns to investors  and greater efficiency  and profitability for the banking sector     The parties to a securitization include the seller of the collateral  pool of loans   the servicer of the loans  and the special purpose entity  SPE   The SPE is bank  ruptcy remote which plays a pivotal role in the securitization     A common structure in a securitization is subordination which leads to the  creation of more than one bond class or tranche  Bond classes differ as to how  they will share any losses resulting from defaults of the borrowers whose loans  are in the collateral  The credit ratings assigned to the various bond classes  depend on how the credit  rating agencies evaluate the credit risks of the collat  eral and any credit enhancements      The motivation for the creation of different types of structures is to redistribute  prepayment risk and credit risk efficiently among different bond classes in the  securitization  Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the actual cash flows will  be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the loan agreements  because borrowers may choose to repay the principal early to take advantage of  interest rate movements      Because of the SPE  the securitization of a company  s assets may include some  bond classes that have better credit ratings than the company itself or its corpo  rate bonds   Thus  the company  s funding cost is often lower when raising funds  through securitization than when issuing corporate bonds      A mortgage is a loan secured by the collateral of some specified real estate  property that obliges the borrower to make a predetermined series of payments  to the lender  The cash flow of a mortgage includes     interest      scheduled  principal payments  and     prepayments  any principal repaid in excess of the  scheduled principal payment      The various mortgage designs throughout the world specify     the maturity of  the loan      how the interest rate is determined  i e  fixed rate versus adjust  able or variable rate       how the principal is repaid  i e  whether the loan is  amortizing and if it is  whether it is fully amortizing or partially amortizing with  a balloon payment       whether the borrower has the option to prepay and if  so whether any prepayment penalties might be imposed  and     the rights of  the lender in a foreclosure  i e  whether the loan is a recourse or non  recourse  loan      In the United States  there are three sectors for securities backed by residen  tial mortgages       those guaranteed by a federal agency  Ginnie Mae  whose  securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government      those  guaranteed by a GSE  e g   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  but not by the US  government  and     those issued by private entities that are not guaranteed by

4,534,  B is correct   Securitization increases the funds available for banks to lend  because it allows banks to remove loans from their balance sheets and issue  bonds that are backed by those loans   Securitization repackages relatively sim  ple debt obligations  such as bank loans  into more complex  not simpler struc  tures   Securitization involves transferring ownership of assets from the original  owner in this case the banks into a special legal entity  As a result  banks do  not maintain ownership of the securitized assets     C is correct   By removing the wall between ultimate investors and originating  borrowers  investors can achieve better legal claims on the underlying mort  gages and portfolios of receivables   This transparency allows investors to tailor  interest rate risk and credit risk to their specific needs     C is correct   Securitization allows for the creation of tradable securities with  greater liquidity than the original loans on a bank s balance sheet   Securitization  results in lessening the roles of intermediaries  which increases disintermedia  tion  Securitization is a process in which relatively simple debt obligations  such  as loans  are repackaged into more complex structures     A is correct   In a securitization the special purpose entity  SPE  is the special  legal entity responsible for the issuance of the asset  backed securities   The  servicer not the SPE  is responsible for both the collection of payments from  the borrowers and the recovery of underlying assets if the borrowers default on  their loans     C is correct   The first                million in default are absorbed by the  subordinated classes  C and B   The senior Class A bonds will only experience a  loss when defaults exceed     million    A is correct   Time tranching is the process in which a set of bond classes or  tranches is created that allow investors a choice in the type of prepayment risk   extension or contraction that they prefer to bear  Senior and subordinated bond  classes are used in credit tranching   Credit tranching structures allow investors  to choose the amount of credit risk that they prefer to bear  Fully and partially  amortizing loans are two types of amortizing loans     C is correct   In a partially amortizing loan the sum of all the scheduled princi  pal repayments is less than the amount borrowed  The last payment is for the  remaining unpaid mortgage balance and is called the  balloon payment      B is correct   Contraction risk is the risk that when interest rates decline actual  prepayments will be higher than forecasted  Extension risk is the risk that when  interest rates rise prepayments will be lower than forecasted  Yield mainte  nance results from prepayment penalties   the lender is protected from loss in  yield by the imposition of prepayment penalties     A is correct   In a recourse loan the lender has a claim against the borrower  for the shortfall between the amount of the mortgage balance outstanding and  the proceeds received from the sale of the property  A prepayment option is a  benefit to the borrower and would thus not offer protection to the lender  An  interest  only mortgage requires no principal repayment for a number of years  and will not protect the lender from strategic default by the borrower     B is correct   Bank Nederlandse has a claim against Marolf for     million EUR   the shortfall between the amount of the mortgage balance outstanding and the  proceeds received from the sale of the property  This indicates that the mort  gage loan is a recourse loan  The recourse non  recourse feature indicates the

4,541,INTRODUCTION
5,541,It is important for analysts to have a well  developed understanding of the risk and  return characteristics of fixed  income investments   Beyond the vast worldwide market  for publicly and privately issued fixed  rate bonds  many financial assets and liabilities  with known future cash flows may be evaluated using the same principles   The start  ing point for this analysis is the yield  to  maturity or internal rate of return on future  cash flows  which was introduced in the fixed  income valuation reading   The return  on a fixed  rate bond is affected by many factors  the most important of which is the  receipt of the interest and principal payments in the full amount and on the scheduled  dates   Assuming no default  the return is also affected by changes in interest rates that  affect coupon reinvestment and the price of the bond if it is sold before it matures    Measures of the price change can be derived from the mathematical relationship used  to calculate the price of the bond  The first of these measures  duration  estimates the  change in the price for a given change in interest rates   The second measure  convexity   improves on the duration estimate by taking into account the fact that the relationship  between price and yield  to  maturity of a fixed  rate bond is not linear  Section   uses numerical examples to demonstrate the sources of return on an  investment in a fixed  rate bond which includes the receipt and reinvestment of cou  pon interest payments and the redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity   The other source of return is capital gains  and losses  on the sale of the bond prior  to maturity  Section   also shows that fixed  income investors holding the same bond  can have different exposures to interest rate risk if their investment horizons differ   Discussion of credit risk  although critical to investors  is postponed to Section   so  that attention can be focused on interest rate risk   Section   provides a thorough review of bond duration and convexity and shows  how the statistics are calculated and used as measures of interest rate risk   Although  procedures and formulas exist to calculate duration and convexity these statistics  can be approximated using basic bond  pricing techniques and a financial calculator   Commonly used versions of the statistics are covered including Macaulay modified  effective and key rate durations   The distinction is made between risk measures that  are based on changes in the bond s yield  to  maturity  i e  yield duration and convexity   and on benchmark yield curve changes  i e  curve duration and convexity   Section   returns to the issue of the investment horizon  When an investor has  a short  term horizon duration  and convexity  are used to estimate the change in  the bond price  In this case yield volatility matters   In particular bonds with varying  times  to  maturity have different degrees of yield volatility  When an investor has a  long  term horizon the interaction between coupon reinvestment risk and market  price risk matters   The relationship among interest rate risk  bond duration and the  investment horizon is explored  Section   discusses how the tools of duration and convexity can be extended to  credit and liquidity risks and highlights how these different factors can affect a bond s  return and risk   A summary of key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple   choice format conclude the reading

7,541,SOURCES OF RETURN
8,541,An investor in a fixed  rate bond has three sources of return      receipt of the promised  coupon and principal payments on the scheduled dates      reinvestment of coupon  payments  and     potential capital gains or losses on the sale of the bond prior to

3,542,maturity  In this section it is assumed that the issuer makes the coupon and principal  payments as scheduled  This reading focuses primarily on interest rate risk  the risk  that interest rates will change  which affects the reinvestment of coupon payments  and the market price if the bond is sold prior to maturity  Credit risk is considered  in Section   of this reading and is the primary subject of the reading  Fundamentals  of Credit Analysis    When a bond is purchased at a premium or a discount  it adds another aspect to  the rate of return  Recall from the reading on fixed  income valuation that a discount  bond offers the investor a  deficient  coupon rate or one below the market discount  rate  The amortization of the discount in each period brings the return in line with  the market discount rate as the bond s carrying value is  pulled to par   For a premium  bond the coupon rate exceeds the market discount rate and the amortization of the  premium adjusts the return to match the market discount rate  Through amortization  the bond s carrying value reaches par value at maturity  A series of examples will demonstrate the effect of a change in interest rates on  two investors  realized rate of returns   Interest rates are the rates at which coupon  payments are reinvested and the market discount rates at the time of purchase and  at the time of sale if the bond is not held to maturity  In Examples   and   interest  rates are unchanged  The two investors  however have different time horizons for  holding the bond  Examples   and   show the impact of an increase in interest rates  on the two investors  total return  Examples   and   show the impact of a decrease  in interest rates   In each of the six examples  an investor initially buys a     year     annual coupon payment bond at a price of           per     of par value  The bond s  yield  to  maturity is

14,543,Example   demonstrates that the yield  to  maturity at the time of purchase measures  the investor  s rate of return under three assumptions       The investor holds the bond  to maturity     there is no default by the issuer and     the coupon interest payments  are reinvested at that same rate of interest   Example    considers another investor who buys the     year    annual coupon  payment bond and pays the same price  This investor however has a four  year invest  ment horizon  Therefore coupon interest is only reinvested for four years  and the  bond is sold immediately after receiving the fourth coupon payment  
15,543,EXAMPLE  
16,543,A second investor buys the     year    annual coupon payment bond and sells  the bond after four years   Assuming that the coupon payments are reinvested  at        for four years  the future value of the reinvested coupons is            per     of par value

82,543,In Example   the investor  s horizon yield is         A horizon yield is the inter  nal rate of return between the total return  the sum of reinvested coupon payments  and the sale price or redemption amount  and the purchase price of the bond  The  horizon yield on a bond investment is the annualized holding  period rate of return  Example    demonstrates that the realized horizon yield matches the original  yield  to  maturity if     coupon payments are reinvested at the same interest rate as  the original yield  to  maturity and     the bond is sold at a price on the constant  yield  price trajectory which implies that the investor does not have any capital gains or  losses when the bond is sold

25,544,Note   Price is price per     of par value
26,544,A point on the trajectory represents the carrying value of the bond at that time   The carrying value is the purchase price plus the amortized amount of the discount  if the bond is purchased at a price below par value  If the bond is purchased at a  price above par value the carrying value is the purchase price minus the amortized  amount of the premium  The amortized amount for each year is the change in the price between two points  on the trajectory  The initial price of the bond is           per     of par value  Its  price  the carrying value  after one year is           calculated using the original  yield  to  maturity of         Therefore the amortized amount for the first year is                                      The bond price in Example    increases from            to           and that increase over the four years is movement along the  constant  yield price trajectory  At the time the bond is sold its carrying value is also            so there is no capital gain or loss   Examples   and   demonstrate the impact on investors  realized horizon yields if  interest rates go up by     basis points  bps   The market discount rate on the bond  increases from        to         Coupon reinvestment rates go up by     bps as well

14,547,The investor in Example   has a capital gain of                                      The capital gain is measured from the carrying value the point on the constant  yield  price trajectory  That gain offsets the reduction in the future value of reinvested cou  pons of                                     The total return is higher than that in  Example   in which the interest rate remains at         In these examples  interest income for the investor is the return associated with  the passage of time  Therefore interest income includes the receipt of coupon inter  est  the reinvestment of those cash flows  and the amortization of the discount from  purchase at a price below par value  or the premium from purchase at a price above  par value  to bring the return back in line with the market discount rate  A capital  gain or loss is the return to the investor associated with the change in the value of  the security  On the fixed  rate bond a change in value arises from a change in the  yield  to  maturity which is the implied market discount rate  In practice the manner  in which interest income and capital gains and losses are calculated and reported on  financial statements depends on financial and tax accounting rules   This series of examples illustrates an important point about fixed  rate bonds    The investment horizon is at the heart of understanding interest rate risk and return   There are two offsetting types of interest rate risk that affect the bond investor   cou  pon reinvestment risk and market price risk   The future value of reinvested coupon  payments  and in a portfolio the principal on bonds that mature before the horizon  date  increases when interest rates go up and decreases when rates go down  The  sale price on a bond that matures after the horizon date  and thus needs to be sold   decreases when interest rates go up and increases when rates go down  Coupon rein  vestment risk matters more when the investor has a long  term horizon relative to the  time  to  maturity of the bond  For instance a buy  and  hold investor only has coupon  reinvestment risk   Market price risk matters more when the investor has a short  term  horizon relative to the time  to  maturity  For example an investor who sells the bond  before the first coupon is received has only market price risk   Therefore two investors  holding the same bond  or bond portfolio  can have different exposures to interest  rate risk if they have different investment horizons

4,549,The duration of a bond measures the sensitivity of the bond s full price  including  accrued interest  to changes in the bond s yield  to  maturity or more generally to  changes in benchmark interest rates   Duration estimates changes in the bond price  assuming that variables other than the yield  to  maturity or benchmark rates are held  constant   Most importantly the time  to  maturity is unchanged  Therefore duration  measures the instantaneous  or at least  same  day  change in the bond price  The  accrued interest is the same so it is the flat price that goes up or down when the full  price changes   Duration is a useful measure because it represents the approximate  amount of time a bond would have to be held for the market discount rate at pur  chase to be realized if there is a single change in interest rate  If the bond is held for  the duration period an increase from reinvesting coupons is offset by a decrease in  price if interest rates increase and a decrease from reinvesting coupons is offset by  an increase in price if interest rates decrease  There are several types of bond duration  In general these can be divided into  yield duration and curve duration  Yield duration is the sensitivity of the bond price  with respect to the bond s own yield  to  maturity  Curve duration is the sensitivity of  the bond price  or more generally the market value of a financial asset or liability   with respect to a benchmark yield curve  The benchmark yield curve could be the  government yield curve on coupon bonds  the spot curve or the forward curve but  in practice the government par curve is often used  Yield duration statistics used in  fixed  income analysis include Macaulay duration modified duration money duration  and the price value of a basis point  PVBP   A curve duration statistic often used is  effective duration  Effective duration is covered in Section      Macaulay duration is named after Frederick Macaulay the Canadian economist  who first wrote about the statistic in a book published in        Equation   is a general  formula to calculate the Macaulay duration  MacDur  of a traditional fixed  rate bond

62,556,Another approach to assess the interest rate risk of a bond is to estimate the percentage  change in price given a change in a benchmark yield curve for example the govern  ment par curve  This estimate which is very similar to the formula for approximate  modified duration is called the effective duration  The effective duration of a bond is  the sensitivity of the bond s price to a change in a benchmark yield curve  The formula  to calculate effective duration  EffDur  is Equation

78,556,The difference between approximate modified duration and effective duration is  in the denominator  Modified duration is a yield duration statistic in that it measures  interest rate risk in terms of a change in the bond s own yield  to  maturity   Yield    Effective duration is a curve duration statistic in that it measures interest rate risk in  terms of a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve   Curve   Effective duration is essential to the measurement of the interest rate risk of a  complex bond such as a bond that contains an embedded call option  The duration  of a callable bond is not the sensitivity of the bond price to a change in the yield  to   worst  i e  the lowest of the yield  to  maturity yield  to  first  call yield  to  second  call  and so forth   The problem is that future cash flows are uncertain because they are  contingent on future interest rates   The issuer  s decision to call the bond depends on  the ability to refinance the debt at a lower cost of funds   In brief a callable bond does  not have a well  defined internal rate of return  yield  to  maturity   Therefore yield  duration statistics  such as modified and Macaulay durations  do not apply   effective  duration is the appropriate duration measure

3,557,The specific option  pricing models that are used to produce the inputs to effective  duration for a callable bond are covered in later readings   However as an example  suppose that the full price of a callable bond is            per     of par value  The  option  pricing model inputs include     the length of the call protection period      the schedule of call prices and call dates      an assumption about credit spreads over  benchmark yields  which includes any liquidity spread as well      an assumption  about future interest rate volatility and     the level of market interest rates  e g    the government par curve   The analyst then holds the first four inputs constant  and raises and lowers the fifth input   Suppose that when the government par curve  is raised and lowered by    bps  the new full prices for the callable bond from the  model are           and            respectively  Therefore PV               PV               PV               and  Curve           The effective duration for the  callable bond is

10,557,This curve duration measure indicates the bond s sensitivity to the benchmark yield  curve in particular the government par curve assuming no change in the credit  spread  In practice a callable bond issuer might be able to exercise the call option and  obtain a lower cost of funds if     benchmark yields fall and the credit spread over  the benchmark is unchanged or     benchmark yields are unchanged and the credit  spread is reduced  e g   because of an upgrade in the issuer  s rating   A pricing model  can be used to determine a  credit duration  statistic that is  the sensitivity of the  bond price to a change in the credit spread  On a traditional fixed  rate bond modified  duration estimates the percentage price change for a change in the benchmark yield  and or the credit spread  For bonds that do not have a well  defined internal rate of  return because the future cash flows are not fixed for instance callable bonds and  floating  rate notes pricing models are used to produce different statistics for changes  in benchmark interest rates and for changes in credit risk   Another fixed  income security for which yield duration statistics  such as modified  and Macaulay durations  are not relevant is a mortgage  backed bond  These securities  arise from a residential  or commercial  loan portfolio securitization  The key point  for measuring interest rate risk on a mortgage  backed bond is that the cash flows are  contingent on homeowners  ability to refinance their debt at a lower rate  In effect   the homeowners have call options on their mortgage loans   A practical consideration in using effective duration is in setting the change in the  benchmark yield curve  With approximate modified duration accuracy is improved by  choosing a smaller yield  to  maturity change  But the pricing models for more  complex  securities  such as callable and mortgage  backed bonds  include assumptions about  the behavior of the corporate issuers  businesses  or homeowners   Rates typically need  to change by a minimum amount to affect the decision to call a bond or refinance a  mortgage loan because issuing new debt involves transaction costs   Therefore estimates  of interest rate risk using effective duration are not necessarily improved by choosing  a smaller change in benchmark rates   Effective duration has become an important  tool in the financial analysis of not only traditional bonds but also financial liabilities    Example   demonstrates such an application of effective duration

3,560,    Key Rate Duration
4,560,Key rate duration provides further insight into a bond s sensitivity to changes in the  benchmark yield curve  A key rate duration  or partial duration  is a measure of  a bond s sensitivity to a change in the benchmark yield curve at a specific maturity  segment   In contrast to effective duration key rate durations help identify  shaping  risk  for a bond that is  a bond s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the benchmark  yield curve  e g   the yield curve becoming steeper or flatter   The previous illustration of effective duration assumed a parallel shift of    bps at  all maturities   However the analyst may want to know how the price of the callable  bond is expected to change if benchmark rates at short maturities  say up to   years   shifted up by    bps but longer maturity benchmark rates remained unchanged  This  scenario would represent a flattening of the yield curve given that the yield curve  is upward sloping   Using key rate durations  the expected price change would be  approximately equal to minus the key rate duration for the short maturity segment  times the        interest rate shift at that segment   Of course for parallel shifts in  the benchmark yield curve key rate durations will indicate the same interest rate  sensitivity as effective duration 
5,560,    Properties of Bond Duration
6,560,The Macaulay and modified yield duration statistics for a traditional fixed  rate bond  are functions of the input variables   the coupon rate or payment per period the yield   to  maturity per period the number of periods to maturity  as of the beginning of  the period  and the fraction of the period that has gone by  The properties of bond  duration are obtained by changing one of these variables while holding the others  constant   Because duration is the basic measure of interest rate risk on a fixed  rate  bond these properties are important to understand  The closed  form formula for Macaulay duration presented as Equation    and  again here is useful in demonstrating the characteristics of the bond duration statistic

37,560,The same characteristics hold for modified duration  Consider first the fraction of  the period that has gone by  t T   Macaulay and modified durations depend on the  day  count basis used to obtain the yield  to  maturity  The duration of a bond that uses  the actual actual method to count days is slightly different from that of an otherwise  comparable bond that uses the        method  The key point is that for a constant  yield  to  maturity  r  the expression in braces is unchanged as time passes during the  period  Therefore the Macaulay duration decreases smoothly as t goes from t     to  t   T which creates a  saw  tooth  pattern  This pattern for a typical fixed  rate bond  is illustrated in Exhibit

1,562,Interest Rate Risk on Fixed  Rate Bonds
2,562,   
3,562,The numerator is positive because the coupon rate  c  is greater than or equal to the  yield  to  maturity  r  whereas the denominator is always positive  Therefore the  Macaulay duration is always less than      r  r and it approaches that threshold from  below as the time  to  maturity increases   The curious result displayed in Exhibit    is in the pattern for discount bonds    Generally the Macaulay duration increases for a longer time  to  maturity  But at  some point when the time  to  maturity is high enough the Macaulay duration exceeds        r  r reaches a maximum and then approaches the threshold from above  In  Equation   such a pattern develops when the number of periods  N  is large and the  coupon rate  c  is below the yield  to  maturity  r   Then the numerator of the second  expression within the braces can become negative  The implication is that on long   term discount bonds  the interest rate risk can actually be less than on a shorter  term  bond which explains why the word  generally   is needed in describing the maturity  effect for the relationship between bond prices and yields  to  maturity  Generally  for the same coupon rate a longer  term bond has a greater percentage price change  than a shorter  term bond when their yields  to  maturity change by the same amount    The exception is when the longer  term bond actually has a lower duration statistic  Coupon rates and yields  to  maturity are both inversely related to the Macaulay  duration  In Exhibit    for the same time  to  maturity and yield  to  maturity the  Macaulay duration is higher for a zero  coupon bond than for a low  coupon bond  trading at a discount   Also the low  coupon bond trading at a discount has a higher  duration than a high  coupon bond trading at a premium  Therefore all else being  equal a lower  coupon bond has a higher duration and more interest rate risk than a  higher  coupon bond  The same pattern holds for the yield  to  maturity  A higher yield   to  maturity reduces the weighted average of the time to receipt of cash flow  More  weight is on the cash flows received in the near term and less weight is on the cash  flows received in the more  distant future periods if those cash flows are discounted  at a higher rate  In summary the Macaulay and modified duration statistics for a fixed  rate bond  depend primarily on the coupon rate yield  to  maturity and time  to  maturity  A  higher coupon rate or a higher yield  to  maturity reduces the duration measures   A  longer time  to  maturity usually leads to a higher duration  It always does so for a  bond priced at a premium or at par value  But if the bond is priced at a discount  a  longer time  to  maturity might lead to a lower duration  This situation only occurs if the  coupon rate is low  but not zero  relative to the yield and the time  to  maturity is long

29,564,Despite the significant differences in times  to  maturity        and    years   the approximate modified durations on the three bonds are fairly similar               and         Because the yields  to  maturity are so high the additional time  to receipt of interest and principal payments on the     and     year bonds have  low weight   Nevertheless  Bond B with    years to maturity has the highest  modified duration  If the yield  to  maturity on each is decreased by the same  amount for instance by    bps  from     to        Bond B would be expected  to have the highest percentage price increase because it has the highest mod  ified duration  This example illustrates the relationship between the Macaulay  duration and the time  to  maturity on discount bonds in Exhibit    The     year  bond has a higher duration than the     year bond 
30,564,Callable bonds require the use of effective duration because Macaulay and modi  fied yield duration statistics are not relevant   The yield  to  maturity for callable bonds  is not well  defined because future cash flows are uncertain  Exhibit    illustrates the  impact of the change in the benchmark yield curve   Curve  on the price of a callable  bond price compared with that on a comparable non  callable bond  The two bonds  have the same credit risk  coupon rate payment frequency and time  to  maturity  The  vertical axis is the bond price  The horizontal axis is a particular benchmark yield for  instance a point on the par curve for government bonds

41,564,As shown in Exhibit    the price of the non  callable bond is always greater than  that of the callable bond with otherwise identical features   The difference is the value  of the embedded call option  Recall that the call option is an option to the issuer and  not the holder of the bond  When interest rates are high compared with the coupon  rate the value of the call option is low  When rates are low the value of the call option

2,565,Reading      Understanding Fixed Income Risk and Return
3,565,is much greater because the issuer is more likely to exercise the option to refinance  the debt at a lower cost of funds   The investor bears the  call risk  because if the bond  is called the investor must reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate  Exhibit   shows the inputs for calculating the effective duration of the callable bond   The entire benchmark curve is raised and lowered by the same amount   Curve  The  key point is that when benchmark yields are high the effective durations of the callable  and non  callable bonds are very similar  Although the exhibit does not illustrate it   the slopes of the lines tangent to the price yield curve are about the same in such a  situation  But when interest rates are low the effective duration of the callable bond  is lower than that of the otherwise comparable non  callable bond  That is because  the callable bond price does not increase as much when benchmark yields fall  The  slope of the line tangent to the price yield curve would be flatter  The presence of the  call option limits price appreciation  Therefore an embedded call option reduces the  effective duration of the bond especially when interest rates are falling and the bond  is more likely to be called  The lower effective duration can also be interpreted as a  shorter expected life the weighted average of time to receipt of cash flow is reduced  Exhibit   considers another embedded option a put option

14,565,A putable bond allows the investor to sell the bond back to the issuer prior to  maturity usually at par value which protects the investor from higher benchmark  yields or credit spreads that otherwise would drive the bond to a discounted price   Therefore the price of a putable bond is always higher than that of an otherwise com  parable non  putable bond  The price difference is the value of the embedded put option  An embedded put option reduces the effective duration of the bond especially  when rates are rising   If interest rates are low compared with the coupon rate the  value of the put option is low and the impact of a change in the benchmark yield on  the bond s price is very similar to the impact on the price of a non  putable bond  But  when benchmark interest rates rise the put option becomes more valuable to the  investor  The ability to sell the bond at par value limits the price depreciation as rates  rise  In summary the presence of an embedded option reduces the sensitivity of the  bond price to changes in the benchmark yield curve assuming no change in credit risk

3,566,    Duration of a Bond Portfolio
4,566,Similar to equities  bonds are typically held in a portfolio  There are two ways to cal  culate the duration of a bond portfolio      the weighted average of time to receipt of  the aggregate cash flows and     the weighted average of the individual bond durations  that comprise the portfolio  The first method is the theoretically correct approach  but it is difficult to use in practice  The second method is commonly used by fixed   income portfolio managers  but it has its own limitations   The differences in these two  methods to compute portfolio duration can be examined with a numerical example  Suppose an investor holds the following portfolio of two zero  coupon bonds

76,566,There are just two future cash flows in the portfolio the redemption of principal  on the two zero  coupon bonds   In more complex portfolios  a series of coupon and  principal payments may occur on some dates  with an aggregated cash flow composed  of coupon interest on some bonds and principal on those that mature  The modified duration of the portfolio is the Macaulay duration divided by one  plus the cash flow yield per period  here the periodicity is

3,567,amount as the change in the yields  to  maturity on the individual bonds   For instance  if the yields  to  maturity on the two zero  coupon bonds in this portfolio both increase  or decrease by    bps  the cash flow yield increases or decreases by only      bps   In practice the second approach to portfolio duration is commonly used  The  Macaulay and modified durations for the portfolio are calculated as the weighted  average of the statistics for the individual bonds   The shares of overall portfolio market  value are the weights   This weighted average is an approximation of the  theoretically  correct  portfolio duration which is obtained using the first approach  This approxi  mation becomes more accurate when the differences in the yields  to  maturity on the  bonds in the portfolio are smaller  When the yield curve is flat  the two approaches  produce the same portfolio duration  Given the equal         weights in this simple numerical example this version of  portfolio duration is easily computed   Average Macaulay duration                                    Average modified duration                                              Note that                    and                       An advantage of the second  approach is that callable bonds  putable bonds  and floating  rate notes can be included  in the weighted average using the effective durations for these securities   The main advantage to the second approach is that it is easily used as a measure of  interest rate risk   For instance if the yields  to  maturity on the bonds in the portfolio  increase by     bps  the estimated drop in the portfolio value is           However  this advantage also indicates a limitation  This measure of portfolio duration implicitly  assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve  A parallel yield curve shift implies that  all rates change by the same amount in the same direction  In reality interest rate  changes frequently result in a steeper or flatter yield curve  Yield volatility is discussed  later in this reading

32,568,    
33,568,Modified duration is a measure of the percentage price change of a bond given a change  in its yield  to  maturity  A related statistic is money duration  The money duration  of a bond is a measure of the price change in units of the currency in which the bond  is denominated  The money duration can be stated per     of par value or in terms  of the actual position size of the bond in the portfolio  In the United States  money  duration is commonly called  dollar duration   Money duration  MoneyDur  is calculated as the annual modified duration times  the full price  PVFull  of the bond including accrued interest   MoneyDur   AnnModDur   PVFull   The estimated change in the bond price in currency units is calculated using  Equation     which is very similar to Equation     The difference is that for a given  change in the annual yield  to  maturity   Yield  modified duration estimates the  percentage price change and money duration estimates the change in currency units    PVFull    MoneyDur    Yield   For an example of money duration consider the    semiannual coupon payment  bond that matures on    February       and is priced to yield       for settlement  on    April        The full price of the bond is            per     of par value  and the annual modified duration is         Suppose that a Hong Kong based life  insurance company has a position in the bond for a par value of HKD            The market value of the investment is HKD           The money duration of this  bond is HKD                       HKD            Therefore if the yield  to   maturity rises by     bps from       to       the expected loss is approximately  HKD           HKD                     On a percentage basis  that expected  loss is approximately          The  convexity adjustment  introduced in the next  section makes these estimates more accurate

3,569,Another version of money duration is the price value of a basis point  PVBP  for  the bond  The PVBP is an estimate of the change in the full price given a   bp change  in the yield  to  maturity  The PVBP can be calculated using a formula similar to that  for the approximate modified duration  Equation    is the formula for the PVBP

3,576,The factors that lead to greater convexity are the same as for duration  A fixed  rate  bond with a longer time  to  maturity a lower coupon rate and a lower yield  to   maturity has greater convexity than a bond with a shorter time  to  maturity a higher  coupon rate and a higher yield  to  maturity  Another factor is the dispersion of cash  flows  meaning the degree to which payments are spread out over time  If two bonds  have the same duration the one that has the greater dispersion of cash flows has  the greater convexity  The positive attributes of greater convexity for an investor are  shown in Exhibit

11,576,The two bonds in Exhibit    are assumed to have the same price yield  to  maturity  and modified duration  Therefore they share the same line tangent to their price  yield curves   The benefit of greater convexity occurs when their yields  to  maturity  change  For the same decrease in yield  to  maturity the more convex bond appreciates  more in price  And for the same increase in yield  to  maturity the more convex bond  depreciates less in price  The conclusion is that the more convex bond outperforms  the less convex bond in both bull  rising price  and bear  falling price  markets   This  conclusion assumes  however that this positive attribute is not  priced into  the  bond  To the extent that it is included the more convex bond would have a higher  price  and lower yield  to  maturity   That does not diminish the value of convexity  It  only suggests that the investor has to pay for it   As economists say  There is no such  thing as a free lunch

22,578,Negative convexity which could be called  concavity  is an important feature of  callable bonds   Putable bonds  on the other hand always have positive convexity  As  a second  order effect  effective convexity indicates the change in the first  order effect   i e  effective duration  as the benchmark yield curve is changed  In Exhibit   as the  benchmark yield goes down the slope of the line tangent to the curve for the non   callable bond steepens  which indicates positive convexity  But the slope of the line  tangent to the callable bond flattens as the benchmark yield goes down  Technically it  reaches an inflection point  which is when the effective convexity shifts from positive  to negative  In summary when the benchmark yield is high and the value of the embedded call  option is low the callable and the non  callable bonds experience very similar effects  from interest rate changes   They both have positive convexity  But as the benchmark  yield is reduced the curves diverge  At some point  the callable bond moves into the  range of negative convexity which indicates that the embedded call option has more  value to the issuer and is more likely to be exercised  This situation limits the potential  price appreciation of the bond arising from lower interest rates  whether because of  a lower benchmark yield or a lower credit spread  Another way to understand why a callable bond can have negative convexity is to  rearrange Equation

45,578,In the numerator the first bracketed expression is the increase in price when the  benchmark yield curve is lowered  The second expression is the decrease in price when  the benchmark yield curve is raised  On a non  callable bond the increase is always  larger than the decrease  in absolute value   This result is the  convexity effect  for  the relationship between bond prices and yields  to  maturity  On a callable bond the  increase can be smaller than the decrease  in absolute value   That creates negative  convexity as illustrated in Exhibit

3,579,    Yield Volatility
4,579,An important aspect in understanding the interest rate risk and return characteristics  of an investment in a fixed  rate bond is the time horizon  This section considers a  short  term horizon  A primary concern for the investor is the change in the price of  the bond given a sudden  i e  same  day  change in its yield  to  maturity  The accrued  interest does not change so the impact of the change in the yield is on the flat price  of the bond  Section     considers a long  term horizon  The reinvestment of coupon  interest then becomes a key factor in the investor  s horizon yield  Bond duration is the primary measure of risk arising from a change in the yield   to  maturity  Convexity is the secondary risk measure  In the discussion of the impact  on the bond price the phrase  for a given change in the yield  to  maturity   is used  repeatedly  For instance the given change in the yield  to  maturity could be   bp     bps  or     bps   In comparing two bonds  it is assumed that the  given change  is  the same for both securities   When the government bond par curve is shifted up or  down by the same amount to calculate effective duration and effective convexity the  events are described as  parallel  yield curve shifts   Because yield curves are rarely  if  ever  straight lines  this shift may also be described as a  shape  preserving  shift to  the yield curve  The key assumption is that all yields  to  maturity under consideration  rise or fall by the same amount across the curve  Although the assumption of a parallel shift in the yield curve is common in fixed   income analysis  it is not always realistic  In reality the shape of the yield curve changes  based on factors affecting the supply and demand of shorter  term versus longer  term  securities   In fact  the term structure of bond yields  also called the  term structure  of interest rates   is typically upward sloping   However the term structure of yield  volatility may have a different shape depending on a number of factors   The term  structure of yield volatility is the relationship between the volatility of bond yields   to  maturity and times  to  maturity  For example a central bank engaging in expansionary monetary policy might cause  the yield curve to steepen by reducing short  term interest rates   But this policy might  cause greater volatility in short  term bond yields  to  maturity than in longer  term  bonds  resulting in a downward  sloping term structure of yield volatility  Longer   term bond yields are mostly determined by future inflation and economic growth  expectations   Those expectations often tend to be less volatile  The importance of yield volatility in measuring interest rate risk is that bond price  changes are products of two factors       the impact per basis  point change in the  yield  to  maturity and     the number of basis points in the yield  to  maturity change   The first factor is duration or the combination of duration and convexity and the  second factor is the yield volatility  For example consider a    year bond with a mod  ified duration of     and a     year bond with a modified duration of       Clearly for  a given change in yield  to  maturity the     year bond represents more much more  interest rate risk to an investor who has a short  term horizon  In fact  the     year  bond appears to have four times the risk given the ratio of the modified durations    But that assumption neglects the possibility that the     year bond might have half  the yield volatility of the    year bond  Equation    restated here summarizes the two factors

68,580,Although short  term interest rate risk is a concern to some investors  other investors  have a long  term horizon  Day  to  day changes in bond prices cause unrealized capital  gains and losses   Those unrealized gains and losses might need to be accounted for in  financial statements   This section considers a long  term investor concerned only with  the total return over the investment horizon  Therefore interest rate risk is important  to this investor  The investor faces coupon reinvestment risk as well as market price  risk if the bond needs to be sold prior to maturity  Section   included examples of interest rate risk using a     year    annual coupon  payment bond that is priced at           per     of par value  The bond s yield  to   maturity is         A key result in Example   is that an investor with a     year time  horizon is concerned only with coupon reinvestment risk   This situation assumes  of  course that the issuer makes all of the coupon and principal payments as scheduled   The buy  and  hold investor has a higher total return if interest rates rise  see Example     and a lower total return if rates fall  see Example     The investor in Examples   and

21,583,As demonstrated in Panel A of Exhibit    when interest rates rise duration mea  sures the immediate drop in value  In particular the money duration indicates the  change in price  Then as time passes  the bond price is  pulled to par   The gain in the  future value of reinvested coupons starts small but builds over time as more coupons  are received  The curve indicates the additional future value of reinvested coupons  because of the higher interest rate  At some point in the lifetime of the bond those  two effects offset each other and the gain on reinvested coupons is equal to the loss  on the sale of the bond  That point in time is the Macaulay duration statistic  The same pattern is displayed in the Panel B when interest rates fall which leads to  a reduction in the bond yield and the coupon reinvestment rate  There is an immediate  jump in the bond price as measured by the money duration but then the  pulled  to par  effect brings the price down as time passes   The impact from reinvesting at  a lower rate starts small but then becomes more significant over time  The loss on  reinvested coupons is with respect to the future value if interest rates had not fallen   Once again the bond s Macaulay duration indicates the point in time when the two  effects offset each other and the gain on the sale of the bond matches the loss on  coupon reinvestment   The earlier numerical example and Exhibit    allow for a statement of the general  relationships among interest rate risk  the Macaulay duration and the investment  horizon    When the investment horizon is greater than the Macaulay duration of a bond  coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk   The investor  s risk is to  lower interest rates

5,585,A negative duration gap entails the risk of lower interest rates   To be precise  the risk is an immediate one  time parallel downward yield curve shift because  coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk   The loss from reinvesting  coupons at a rate lower than    is larger than the gain from selling the bond at  a price above the constant  yield price trajectory 
6,585,CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK
7,585,The focus of this reading is to demonstrate how bond duration and convexity estimate  the bond price change either in percentage terms or in units of currency given an  assumed yield  to  maturity change  This section addresses the source of the change in  the yield  to  maturity  In general the yield  to  maturity on a corporate bond is composed  of a government benchmark yield and a spread over that benchmark   A change in the  bond s yield  to  maturity can originate in either component or a combination of the two  The key point is that for a traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bond the same dura  tion and convexity statistics apply for a change in the benchmark yield as for a change  in the spread  The  building blocks  approach from  Introduction to Fixed  Income  Valuation  shows that these yield  to  maturity changes can be broken down further  A  change in the benchmark yield can arise from a change in either the expected inflation  rate or the expected real rate of interest  A change in the spread can arise from a change  in the credit risk of the issuer or in the liquidity of the bond  Therefore for a fixed  rate  bond the  inflation duration  the  real rate duration  the  credit duration  and the   liquidity duration  are all the same number  The inflation duration would indicate  the change in the bond price if expected inflation were to change by a certain amount    In the same manner the real rate duration would indicate the bond price change if  the real rate were to go up or down  The credit duration and liquidity duration would  indicate the price sensitivity that would arise from changes in those building blocks  in the yield  to  maturity  A bond with a modified duration of      and a convexity of        will appreciate in value by about       if its yield  to  maturity goes down by     bps                                                             regardless of the  source of the yield  to  maturity change  Suppose that the yield  to  maturity on a corporate bond is        If the bench  mark yield is       the spread is        An analyst believes that credit risk makes up        of the spread and liquidity risk  the remaining        Credit risk includes the  probability of default as well as the recovery of assets if default does occur  A credit  rating downgrade or an adverse change in the ratings outlook for a borrower reflects  a higher risk of default   Liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with  selling a bond  In general a bond with greater frequency of trading and a higher vol  ume of trading provides fixed  income investors with more opportunity to purchase  or sell the security and thus has less liquidity risk   In practice there is a difference  between the bid  or purchase  and the offer  or sale  price  This difference depends  on the type of bond the size of the transaction and the time of execution among  other factors   For instance government bonds often trade at just a few basis points  between the purchase and sale prices   More thinly traded corporate bonds can have  a much wider difference between the bid and offer prices   The problem for a fixed  income analyst is that it is rare for the changes in the  components of the overall yield  to  maturity to occur in isolation  In practice the  analyst is concerned with the interaction between changes in benchmark yields and  spreads  between changes in expected inflation and the expected real rate and between  changes in credit and liquidity risk   For example during a financial crisis  a  flight

13,586,SUMMARY
14,586,This reading covers the risk and return characteristics of fixed  rate bonds   The focus  is on the widely used measures of interest rate risk duration and convexity  These  statistics are used extensively in fixed  income analysis   The following are the main  points made in the reading     The three sources of return on a fixed  rate bond purchased at par value are      receipt of the promised coupon and principal payments on the scheduled dates       reinvestment of coupon payments  and     potential capital gains  as well as  losses  on the sale of the bond prior to maturity     For a bond purchased at a discount or premium the rate of return also includes  the effect of the price being  pulled to par  as maturity nears  assuming no  default      The total return is the future value of reinvested coupon interest payments and  the sale price  or redemption of principal if the bond is held to maturity      The horizon yield  or holding period rate of return  is the internal rate of return  between the total return and purchase price of the bond     Coupon reinvestment risk increases with a higher coupon rate and a longer  reinvestment time period

3,587,   Capital gains and losses are measured from the carrying value of the bond and  not from the purchase price  The carrying value includes the amortization of  the discount or premium if the bond is purchased at a price below or above par  value  The carrying value is any point on the constant  yield price trajectory     Interest income on a bond is the return associated with the passage of time   Capital gains and losses are the returns associated with a change in the value of  a bond as indicated by a change in the yield  to  maturity     The two types of interest rate risk on a fixed  rate bond are coupon reinvestment  risk and market price risk   These risks offset each other to a certain extent   An  investor gains from higher rates on reinvested coupons but loses if the bond is  sold at a capital loss because the price is below the constant  yield price trajec  tory  An investor loses from lower rates on reinvested coupon but gains if the  bond is sold at a capital gain because the price is above the constant  yield price  trajectory     Market price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk when the investor has a  short  term horizon  relative to the time  to  maturity on the bond      Coupon reinvestment risk dominates market price risk when the investor has a  long  term horizon  relative to the time  to  maturity  for instance a buy  and   hold investor     Bond duration in general measures the sensitivity of the full price  including  accrued interest  to a change in interest rates      Yield duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond s full price to the  bond s own yield  to  maturity include the Macaulay duration modified duration  money duration and price value of a basis point      Curve duration statistics measuring the sensitivity of a bond s full price to the  benchmark yield curve are usually called  effective durations       Macaulay duration is the weighted average of the time to receipt of coupon  interest and principal payments  in which the weights are the shares of the full  price corresponding to each payment   This statistic is annualized by dividing  by the periodicity  number of coupon payments or compounding periods in a  year      Modified duration provides a linear estimate of the percentage price change for  a bond given a change in its yield  to  maturity     Approximate modified duration approaches modified duration as the change in  the yield  to  maturity approaches zero     Effective duration is very similar to approximate modified duration  The dif  ference is that approximate modified duration is a yield duration statistic that  measures interest rate risk in terms of a change in the bond s own yield  to   maturity whereas effective duration is a curve duration statistic that measures  interest rate risk assuming a parallel shift in the benchmark yield curve     Key rate duration is a measure of a bond s sensitivity to a change in the bench  mark yield curve at specific maturity segments   Key rate durations can be used  to measure a bond s sensitivity to changes in the shape of the yield curve     Bonds with an embedded option do not have a meaningful internal rate of  return because future cash flows are contingent on interest rates   Therefore  effective duration is the appropriate interest rate risk measure not modified  duration     The effective duration of a traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bond is its sensi  tivity to the benchmark yield curve which can differ from its sensitivity to its  own yield  to  maturity  Therefore modified duration and effective duration on a  traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bond are not necessarily equal

3,588,   During a coupon period Macaulay and modified durations decline smoothly  in a  saw  tooth  pattern assuming the yield  to  maturity is constant   When the  coupon payment is made the durations jump upward     Macaulay and modified durations are inversely related to the coupon rate and  the yield  to  maturity     Time  to  maturity and Macaulay and modified durations are usually positively  related  They are always positively related on bonds priced at par or at a pre  mium above par value  They are usually positively related on bonds priced at a  discount below par value  The exception is on long  term low  coupon bonds  on  which it is possible to have a lower duration than on an otherwise comparable  shorter  term bond     The presence of an embedded call option reduces a bond s effective duration  compared with that of an otherwise comparable non  callable bond  The reduc  tion in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are low and the  issuer is more likely to exercise the call option     The presence of an embedded put option reduces a bond s effective duration  compared with that of an otherwise comparable non  putable bond  The reduc  tion in the effective duration is greater when interest rates are high and the  investor is more likely to exercise the put option     The duration of a bond portfolio can be calculated in two ways       the weighted  average of the time to receipt of aggregate cash flows and     the weighted aver  age of the durations of individual bonds that compose the portfolio     The first method to calculate portfolio duration is based on the cash flow yield  which is the internal rate of return on the aggregate cash flows   It cannot be  used for bonds with embedded options or for floating  rate notes      The second method is simpler to use and quite accurate when the yield curve  is relatively flat   Its main limitation is that it assumes a parallel shift in the  yield curve in that the yields on all bonds in the portfolio change by the same  amount      Money duration is a measure of the price change in terms of units of the cur  rency in which the bond is denominated     The price value of a basis point  PVBP  is an estimate of the change in the full  price of a bond given a   bp change in the yield  to  maturity     Modified duration is the primary or first  order effect on a bond s percentage  price change given a change in the yield  to  maturity  Convexity is the second  ary or second  order effect   It indicates the change in the modified duration as  the yield  to  maturity changes      Money convexity is convexity times the full price of the bond  Combined with  money duration money convexity estimates the change in the full price of a  bond in units of currency given a change in the yield  to  maturity     Convexity is a positive attribute for a bond  Other things being equal a more  convex bond appreciates in price more than a less convex bond when yields fall  and depreciates less when yields rise     Effective convexity is the second  order effect on a bond price given a change in  the benchmark yield curve  It is similar to approximate convexity  The differ  ence is that approximate convexity is based on a yield  to  maturity change and  effective convexity is based on a benchmark yield curve change     Callable bonds have negative effective convexity when interest rates are low  The  increase in price when the benchmark yield is reduced is less in absolute value  than the decrease in price when the benchmark yield is raised

3,589,   The change in a bond price is the product of     the impact per basis  point  change in the yield  to  maturity and     the number of basis points in the yield  change  The first factor is estimated by duration and convexity  The second  factor depends on yield volatility     The investment horizon is essential in measuring the interest rate risk on a  fixed  rate bond     For a particular assumption about yield volatility the Macaulay duration indi  cates the investment horizon for which coupon reinvestment risk and market  price risk offset each other  The assumption is a one  time parallel shift to the  yield curve in which the yield  to  maturity and coupon reinvestment rates  change by the same amount in the same direction     When the investment horizon is greater than the Macaulay duration of the  bond coupon reinvestment risk dominates price risk   The investor  s risk is to  lower interest rates   The duration gap is negative     When the investment horizon is equal to the Macaulay duration of the bond  coupon reinvestment risk offsets price risk   The duration gap is zero     When the investment horizon is less than the Macaulay duration of the bond  price risk dominates coupon reinvestment risk   The investor  s risk is to higher  interest rates   The duration gap is positive     Credit risk involves the probability of default and degree of recovery if default  occurs  whereas liquidity risk refers to the transaction costs associated with  selling a bond     For a traditional  option  free  fixed  rate bond the same duration and convexity  statistics apply if a change occurs in the benchmark yield or a change occurs in  the spread  The change in the spread can result from a change in credit risk or  liquidity risk      In practice there often is interaction between changes in benchmark yields and  in the spread over the benchmark

5,603,INTRODUCTION
6,603,With bonds outstanding worth many trillions of US dollars  the debt markets play  a critical role in the global economy  Companies and governments raise capital in  the debt market to fund current operations   buy equipment   build factories  roads   bridges  airports  and hospitals   acquire assets  and so on  By channeling savings into  productive investments  the debt markets facilitate economic growth  Credit analysis  has a crucial function in the debt capital markets efficiently allocating capital by  properly assessing credit risk  pricing it accordingly and repricing it as risks change   How do fixed  income investors determine the riskiness of that debt  and how do they  decide what they need to earn as compensation for that risk  This reading covers basic principles of credit analysis  which may be broadly defined  as the process by which credit risk is evaluated  Readers will be introduced to the  definition of credit risk  the interpretation of credit ratings  the four Cs of traditional  credit analysis  and key financial measures and ratios used in credit analysis   The  reading explains  among other things  how to compare bond issuer creditworthiness  within a given industry as well as across industries and how credit risk is priced in  the bond market   The reading focuses primarily on analysis of corporate debt   however credit anal  ysis of sovereign and non  sovereign particularly municipal government bonds will  also be addressed  Structured finance a segment of the debt markets that includes  securities backed by pools of assets  such as residential and commercial mortgages  as well as other consumer loans  will not be covered here  The key components of credit risk default probability and loss severity are  introduced in the next section along with such credit  related risks as spread risk  credit  migration risk  and liquidity risk   Section   discusses the relationship between credit  risk and the capital structure of the firm  Credit ratings and the role of credit rating  agencies are addressed in Section    Section   focuses on the process of analyzing the  credit risk of corporations  whereas Section   examines the impact of credit spreads  on risk and return  Special considerations applicable to the analysis of  i  high  yield   low  quality  corporate bonds and  ii  government bonds are presented in Section     Section   gives a brief summary and a set of review questions concludes the reading  
7,603,CREDIT RISK
8,603,Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower  issuer of debt  failing to make  full and timely payments of interest and or principal  Credit risk has two components    The first is known as default risk or default probability which is the probability  that a borrower defaults that is  fails to meet its obligation to make full and timely  payments of principal and interest  according to the terms of the debt security  The  second component is loss severity  also known as  loss given default   in the event of  default that is  the portion of a bond s value  including unpaid interest  an investor  loses   A default can lead to losses of various magnitudes   In most instances  in the  event of default  bondholders will recover some value so there will not be a total loss  on the investment   Thus  credit risk is reflected in the distribution of potential losses  that may arise if the investor is not paid in full and on time  Although it is sometimes
1,604,Credit Risk
2,604,   
3,604,important to consider the entire distribution of potential losses and their respective  probabilities   it is often convenient to summarize the risk with a single default prob  ability and loss severity and to focus on the expected loss  Expected loss   Default probability   Loss severity given default The loss severity and hence the expected loss  can be expressed as either a  monetary amount  e g            or as a percentage of the principal amount  e g       percent   The latter form of expression is generally more useful for analysis because  it is independent of the amount of investment   Loss severity is often expressed as       Recovery rate  where the recovery rate is the percentage of the principal amount  recovered in the event of default   Because default risk  default probability  is quite low for most high  quality debt  issuers  bond investors tend to focus primarily on assessing this probability and devote  less effort to assessing the potential loss severity arising from default   However as an  issuer  s default risk rises  investors will focus more on what the recovery rate might  be in the event of default   This issue will be discussed in more detail later  Important  credit  related risks include the following      Spread risk  Corporate bonds and other  credit  risky   debt instruments typi  cally trade at a yield premium or spread to bonds that have been considered   default  risk free  such as US Treasury bonds or German government bonds    Yield spreads  expressed in basis points  widen based on two primary factors        a decline in an issuer  s creditworthiness  sometimes referred to as credit  migration or downgrade risk  and     an increase in market liquidity risk   These two risks are separate but frequently related     Credit migration risk or downgrade risk  This is the risk that a bond issuer  s  creditworthiness deteriorates  or migrates lower leading investors to believe  the risk of default is higher and thus causing the yield spreads on the issuer  s  bonds to widen and the price of its bonds to fall  The term  downgrade  refers  to action by the major bond rating agencies  whose role will be covered in more  detail in Section       Market liquidity risk  This is the risk that the price at which investors can actu  ally transact buying or selling may differ from the price indicated in the mar  ket   To compensate investors for the risk that there may not be sufficient market  liquidity for them to buy or sell bonds in the quantity they desire the spread or  yield premium on corporate bonds includes a market liquidity component  in  addition to a credit risk component   Unlike stocks  which trade on exchanges   most markets bonds trade primarily over the counter through broker dealers  trading for their own accounts   Their ability and willingness to make markets  as  reflected in the bid ask spread is an important determinant of market liquidity  risk   The two main issuer  specific factors that affect market liquidity risk are      the size of the issuer  that is  the amount of publicly traded debt an issuer has  outstanding  and     the credit quality of the issuer  In general the less debt an  issuer has outstanding  the less frequently its debt trades  and thus the higher  the market liquidity risk   And the lower the quality of the issuer the higher the  market liquidity risk  
4,604,  As an example careful attention to the full distribution of potential losses is important in analyzing credit  risk in structured finance products because the various tranches usually share unequally in the credit losses  on the underlying loans or securities   A particular tranche typically bears none of the losses up to some  level of underlying losses  then it bears all of the underlying losses until the tranche is wiped out   Losses  on a  thin  tranche are very likely to be either   percent or     percent  with relatively small probabilities  on intermediate loss severities   This situation is not well described by a single  average  loss severity

3,605,During times of financial stress or crisis  such as in late      market liquidity  can decline sharply causing yield spreads on corporate bonds  and other credit  risky  debt  to widen and their prices to drop  Some research has been done on trying to  quantify market liquidity risk   and more is likely to be done in the aftermath of the  financial crisis  
4,605,EXAMPLE  
5,605,Defining Credit Risk
6,605,  Which of the following best defines credit risk  A The probability of default times the severity of loss given default B The loss of principal and interest payments in the event of bankruptcy C The risk of not receiving full interest and principal payments on a  timely basis   Which of the following is the best measure of credit risk  A The expected loss B The severity of loss C The probability of default   Which of the following is NOT credit or credit  related risk  A Default risk B  Interest rate risk C Downgrade or credit migration risk
7,605,Solution to   
8,605,C is correct   Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not make full and  timely payments  
9,605,Solution to   
10,605,A is correct   The expected loss captures both of the key components of credit  risk    the product of   the probability of default and the loss severity in the event  of default   Neither component alone fully reflects the risk  
11,605,Solution to   
12,605,B is correct   Bond price changes due to general interest rate movements are not  considered credit risk

5,606,The various debt obligations of a given borrower will not necessarily all have the same  seniority ranking or priority of payment   In this section we will introduce the topic  of an issuer  s capital structure and discuss the various types of debt claims that may  arise from that structure as well as their ranking and how those rankings can influence  recovery rates in the event of default  
6,606,    Capital Structure
7,606,The composition and distribution across operating units of a company  s debt and  equity including bank debt  bonds of all seniority rankings  preferred stock  and  common equity is referred to as its capital structure  Some companies and industries  have straightforward capital structures  with all the debt equally ranked and issued  by one main operating entity  Other companies and industries  due to their frequent  acquisitions and divestitures  e g   media companies or conglomerates  or high levels of  regulation  e g   banks and utilities  tend to have more complicated capital structures    Companies in these industries often have many different subsidiaries  or operating  companies  that have their own debt outstanding and parent holding companies that  also issue debt  with different levels or rankings of seniority  Similarly the cross   border operations of multi  national corporations tend to increase the complexity of  their capital structures  
8,606,    Seniority Ranking
9,606,Just as borrowers can issue debt with many different maturity dates and coupons   they can also have many different rankings in terms of seniority  The ranking refers to  the priority of payment  with the most senior or highest  ranking debt having the first  claim on the cash flows and assets of the issuer  This level of seniority can affect the  value of an investor  s claim in the event of default and restructuring   Broadly there is  secured debt and unsecured debt  Secured debt means the debtholder has a direct  claim a pledge from the issuer on certain assets and their associated cash flows    Unsecured bondholders have only a general claim on an issuer  s assets and cash flow   In the event of default  unsecured debtholders  claims rank below  i e  get paid after   those of secured creditors  under what s known as the priority of claims 
10,606,  The term  creditors  is used throughout this reading to mean holders of debt instruments  such as bonds  and bank loans   Unless specifically stated it does not include such obligations as trade credit  tax liens  or  employment  related obligations

11,607,Within each category of debt  there are finer gradations of types and rankings    Within secured debt  there is first mortgage and first lien debt  which are the highest   ranked debt in terms of priority of repayment   First mortgage debt or loan refers to  the pledge of a specific property  e g   a power plant for a utility or a specific casino  for a gaming company   First lien debt or loan refers to a pledge of certain assets  that could include buildings but might also include property and equipment  licenses   patents  brands  and so on  There can also be second lien or even third lien secured  debt which as the name implies  has a secured interest in the pledged assets but ranks  below first lien debt in both collateral protection and priority of payment   Within unsecured debt  there can also be finer gradations and seniority rankings    The highest  ranked unsecured debt is senior unsecured debt   It is the most common  type of all corporate bonds outstanding   Other lower  ranked debt includes subor  dinated debt and junior subordinated debt   Among the various creditor classes   these obligations have among the lowest priority of claims and frequently have little  or no recovery in the event of default   That is  their loss severity can be as high as       percent    See Exhibit    for a sample seniority ranking    For regulatory and cap  ital purposes  banks in Europe and the United States have issued debt and debt  like  securities that rank even lower than subordinated debt  and are intended to provide a  capital cushion in times of financial distress   Many of them did not work as intended  during the financial crisis that began in      and most were phased out  potentially  to be replaced by more effective instruments that automatically convert to equity in  certain circumstances   There are many reasons why companies issue and investors buy debt with  different seniority rankings   Issuers are interested in optimizing their cost of cap  ital finding the right mix of the various types of both debt and equity for their  industry and type of business   Issuers may offer secured debt because that is what the  market  i e  investors  may require given a company  s perceived riskiness  or because  secured debt is generally lower cost due to the reduced credit risk inherent in its higher

6,608,The Acme Company has senior unsecured bonds as well as both first and second  lien debt in its capital structure  Which ranks higher with respect to priority of  claims   senior unsecured bonds or second lien debt

8,608,Second lien debt ranks higher than senior unsecured bonds because of its  secured position 
9,608,    Recovery Rates
10,608,All creditors at the same level of the capital structure are treated as one class   thus   a senior unsecured bondholder whose debt is due in    years has the same pro rata  claim in bankruptcy as one whose debt matures in six months   This provision is  referred to as bonds ranking pari passu   on an equal footing   in right of payment   Defaulted debt will often continue to be traded by investors and broker dealers  based on their assessment that either in liquidation of the bankrupt company  s assets  or in reorganization the bonds will have some recovery value  In the case of reorgani  zation or restructuring  whether through formal bankruptcy or on a voluntary basis   new debt  equity cash or some combination thereof could be issued in exchange for  the original defaulted debt   As discussed recovery rates vary by seniority of ranking in a company  s capital  structure under the priority of claims treatment in bankruptcy  Over many decades   there have been enough defaults to generate statistically meaningful historical data  on recovery rates by seniority ranking   Exhibit   provides recovery rates by seniority  ranking for North American non  financial companies    For example as shown in  Exhibit   investors on average recovered      percent of the value of senior unsecured  debt that defaulted in      but only      percent of the value of senior subordinated  issues that defaulted that year 
11,608,  Debtholders require a lower return than equity holders because they have prior claims to an issuer  s  cash flow and assets   That is  the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity  In most countries  this cost  differential is even greater due to the tax deductibility of interest payments     The recovery rates shown for default years      and      should be viewed as preliminary because  some of the numbers are based on the relatively small number of defaults for which final recovery had  been determined at the time of the Moody  s study  For example the      senior unsecured recovery rate  reflects only two bonds

15,609,There are a few things worth noting 
16,609,  Recovery rates can vary widely by industry  Companies that go bankrupt
17,609,in industries that are in secular decline  e g   newspaper publishing  will most  likely have lower recovery rates than those that go bankrupt in industries  merely suffering from a cyclical economic downturn 
18,609,  Recovery rates can also vary depending on when they occur in a credit
19,609,cycle   As shown in Exhibit   at or near the bottom of a credit cycle which  is almost always closely linked with an economic cycle recoveries will tend  to be lower than at other times in the credit cycle  This is because there will be  many companies closer to or already in bankruptcy causing valuations to be  depressed 
20,609,  Credit cycles describe the changing availability and pricing of credit   When the economy is strong or  improving  the willingness of lenders to extend credit  and on favorable terms  is high  Conversely when  the economy is weak or weakening  lenders pull back  or  tighten  credit  by making it less available and  more expensive  This frequently contributes to asset values  such as real estate declining  causing further  economic weakness and higher defaults   Central banks frequently survey banks to assess how  tight  or   loose  their lending standards are  This information as well as the level and direction of corporate bond  default rates  helps provide a good sense of where one is in the credit cycle

25,610,  These recovery rates are averages  In fact  there can be large variability both  across industries  as noted above as well as across companies within a given  industry  Factors might include composition and proportion of debt across an  issuer  s capital structure  An abundance of secured debt will lead to smaller  recovery rates on lower  ranked debt   Understanding recovery rates is important because they are a key component of  credit analysis and risk   Recall that the best measure of credit risk is expected loss  that is  probability of default times loss severity given default   And loss severity equals       Recovery rate   Having an idea how much one can lose in the event of default is a  critical factor in valuing credit particularly lower  quality credit as the default risk rises   Priority of claims  Not always absolute  The priority of claims in bankruptcy the  idea that the highest  ranked creditors get paid out first  followed by the next level  and on down like a waterfall is well established and is often described as  absolute    In principle in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation     Creditors with a secured claim have the right to the value of that specific prop  erty before any other claim  If the value of the pledged property is less than the  amount of the claim then the difference becomes a senior unsecured claim     Unsecured creditors have a right to be paid in full before holders of equity  interests  common and preferred shareholders  receive value on their interests      Senior unsecured creditors take priority over all subordinated creditors   A cred  itor is senior unsecured unless expressly subordinated  In practice however creditors with lower seniority and even shareholders may  receive some consideration without more senior creditors being paid in full  Why  might this be the case  In bankruptcy there are different classes of claimants  and all  classes that are impaired  that is  receive less than full claim  get to vote to confirm  the plan of reorganization  This vote is subject to the absolute priority of claims    Either by consent of the various parties or by the judge s order however absolute  priority may not be strictly enforced in the final plan  There may be disputes over  the value of various assets in the bankruptcy estate  e g   what is a plant  or a patent

3,611,portfolio worth   or the present value or timing of payouts   For example what is the  value of the new debt I m receiving for my old debt of a reorganized company before  it emerges from bankruptcy  Resolution of these disputes takes time and cases can drag on for months and  years   In the meantime during bankruptcy substantial expenses are being incurred  for legal and accounting fees  and the value of the company may be declining as key  employees leave customers go elsewhere and so on  Thus  to avoid the time expense  and uncertainty over disputed issues  such as the value of property in the estate the  legality of certain claims  and so forth the various claimants have an incentive to  negotiate and compromise  This frequently leads to creditors with lower seniority  and other claimants  e g   even shareholders  receiving more consideration than they  are legally entitled to  It s worth noting that in the United States  the bias is toward reorganization and  recovery of companies in bankruptcy whereas in other jurisdictions  such as the United  Kingdom the bias is toward liquidation of companies in bankruptcy and maximizing  value to the banks and other senior creditors   It s also worth noting that bankruptcy  and bankruptcy laws are very complex and can vary greatly by country so it is difficult  to generalize about how creditors will fare  As shown in the earlier chart there is huge  variability in recovery rates for defaulted debt   Every case is different  
4,611,EXAMPLE  
5,611,Priority of Claims
6,611,  Under which circumstance is a subordinated bondholder most likely to  recover some value in a bankruptcy without a senior creditor getting paid  in full  When  A absolute priority rules are enforced  B  the various classes of claimants agree to it   C  the company is liquidated rather than reorganized  In the event of bankruptcy claims at the same level of the capital struc  ture are  A on an equal footing  regardless of size maturity or time outstanding   B paid in the order of maturity from shortest to longest  regardless of  size or time outstanding   C paid on a first  in first  out  FIFO  basis so that the longest  standing  claims are satisfied first  regardless of size or maturity 
7,611, 
8,611,Solution to   
9,611,B is correct   All impaired classes get to vote on the reorganization plan   Negotiation and compromise are often preferable to incurring huge legal and  accounting fees in a protracted bankruptcy process that would otherwise reduce  the value of the estate for all claimants   This process may allow junior creditors   e g   subordinated bondholders  to recover some value even though more senior  creditors do not get paid in full

3,615,an obligor  s overall creditworthiness its ability and willingness to make timely pay  ments of interest and principal on its debt   The issuer credit rating usually applies to  its senior unsecured debt   Issue ratings refer to specific financial obligations of an issuer and take into consid  eration such factors as ranking in the capital structure  e g   secured or subordinated    Although cross  default provisions whereby events of default such as non  payment  of interest   on one bond trigger default on all outstanding debt    implies the same  default probability for all issues  specific issues may be assigned different credit rat  ings higher or lower due to a ratings adjustment methodology known as notching  Notching   For the rating agencies likelihood of default default risk is the primary  factor in assigning their ratings   However there are secondary factors as well  These  factors include the priority of payment in the event of a default  e g   secured versus  senior unsecured versus subordinated  as well as potential loss severity in the event  of default  Another factor considered by rating agencies is structural subordination  which can arise when a corporation with a holding company structure has debt at both  its parent holding company and operating subsidiaries   Debt at the operating subsid  iaries will get serviced by the cash flow and assets of the subsidiaries before funds can  be passed   upstreamed   to the holding company to service debt at that level  Recognizing these different payment priorities  and thus the potential for higher   or lower  loss severity in the event of default  the rating agencies have adopted a  notching process whereby their credit ratings on issues can be moved up or down  from the issuer rating  which is usually the rating applied to its senior unsecured debt    As a general rule the higher the senior unsecured rating  the smaller the notching  adjustment will be  The reason behind this is that the higher the rating  the lower the  perceived risk of default  so the need to  notch  the rating to capture the potential  difference in loss severity is greatly reduced  For lower  rated credits  however the risk  of default is greater and thus the potential difference in loss from a lower  or higher   priority ranking is a bigger consideration in assessing an issue s credit riskiness   Thus   the rating agencies will typically apply larger rating adjustments   For example S P  applies the following notching guidelines   As default risk increases  the concern over what can be recovered takes on  greater relevance and therefore greater rating significance  Accordingly  the LGD  Loss Given Default  aspect of ratings is given more weight as  one moves down the rating spectrum  For example subordinated debt can  be rated up to two notches below a noninvestment grade corporate credit  rating  but one notch at most if the corporate credit rating is investment  grade   In the same vein issues of companies with an  AAA  rating need  not be notched at all     Exhibit    is an example of S P s notching criteria  as applied to United Rentals   Inc   URI   URI is a US   based equipment rental company whose corporate credit and  senior unsecured rating is single  B  Note how the company  s subordinated debt is  rated two notches lower at CCC

26,618,   Credit ratings tend to lag the market s pricing of credit risk  Bond prices and
27,618,credit spreads frequently move more quickly because of changes in perceived  creditworthiness than rating agencies change their ratings  or even outlooks   up or down  Bond prices and relative valuations can move every day whereas  bond ratings  appropriately don t change that often  Even over long time peri  ods  however credit ratings can badly lag changes in bond prices   Exhibit    shows the price and Moody  s rating of a bond from US automaker Ford Motor  Company before during  and after the financial crisis in       Note how the  bond s price moved down sharply well before Moody  s downgraded its credit  rating multiple times and also how the bond s price began to recover and  kept recovering well before Moody  s upgraded its credit rating on Ford debt

71,618,Moreover particularly for certain speculative  grade credits  two bonds with  similar ratings may trade at very different valuations   This is partly a result of  the fact that credit ratings primarily try to assess the risk of default  whereas for  low  quality credits  the market begins focusing more on expected loss  default

3,619,probability times loss severity   So bonds from two separate issuers with  comparable  high  risk of default but different recovery rates may have similar  ratings but trade at significantly different dollar prices     Thus  bond investors who wait for rating agencies to change their ratings before  making buy and sell decisions in their portfolios may be at risk of underper  forming other investors who make portfolio decisions in advance of or not  solely based on rating agency changes      Rating agencies may make mistakes  The mis  rating of billions of dollars of  subprime  backed mortgage securities is one example  Other examples include  the mis  ratings of US companies Enron and WorldCom and European issuer  Parmalat   Like many investors  the rating agencies did not see the accounting  fraud being committed in those companies

10,620,Solution to   
11,620,A is correct   The subordinated bond would have its rating notched lower than  the company  s BB rating  probably by two notches  reflecting the higher weight  given to loss severity for below  investment  grade credits

2,621,Reading      Fundamentals of Credit Analysis
3,621,Solution to   
4,621,C is correct   The market was anticipating the rating upgrade and had already  priced it in  Bond prices often do react to rating changes  particularly multi  notch  ones   Even if bonds don t trade their prices adjust based on dealer quotations  given to bond pricing services  
5,621,Solution to   
6,621,A is correct   Widget s credit ratings are probably lagging behind the market s  assessment of its deteriorating creditworthiness   Answers B and C both state the  situation backwards   If the market believed that the Amalgamated bond had a  higher expected loss given default  then that bond would be trading at a lower  not a higher price  Similarly if the market believed that the Widget bond had a  higher expected recovery rate in the event of default  then that bond would be  trading at a higher not a lower price

8,621,TRADITIONAL CREDIT ANALYSIS  CORPORATE DEBT  SECURITIES
9,621,The goal of credit analysis is to assess an issuer  s ability to satisfy its debt obligations   including bonds and other indebtedness  such as bank loans   These debt obligations  are contracts  the terms of which specify the interest rate to be paid the frequency  and timing of payments  the maturity date and the covenants that describe the  permissible and required actions of the borrower  Because corporate bonds are con  tracts  enforceable by law credit analysts generally assume an issuer  s willingness to  pay and concentrate instead on assessing its ability to pay  Thus  the main focus in  credit analysis is to understand a company  s ability to generate cash flow over the  term of its debt obligations   In so doing  analysts must assess both the credit quality  of the company and the fundamentals of the industry in which the company operates    Traditional credit analysis considers the sources  predictability and sustainability of  cash generated by a company to service its debt obligations   This section will focus  on corporate credit analysis   in particular it will emphasize non  financial companies    Financial institutions have very different business models and funding profiles from  industrial and utility companies  
10,621,    Credit Analysis vs  Equity Analysis  Similarities and  Differences
11,621,The above description of credit analysis suggests credit and equity analyses should  be very similar   in many ways  they are  There are motivational differences  however  between equity and fixed  income investors that are an important aspect of credit  analysis   Strictly speaking  management works for the shareholders of a company  Its  primary objective is to maximize the value of the company for its owners   In contrast   management s legal duty to its creditors including bondholders is to meet the terms  of the governing contracts   Growth in the value of a corporation from rising profits  and cash flow accrues to the shareholders  while the best outcome for bondholders  is to receive full timely payment of interest and repayment of principal when due   Conversely shareholders are more exposed to the decline in value if a company  s  earnings and cash flow decline because bondholders have a prior claim on cash flow  and assets   But if a company  s earnings and cash flow decline to the extent that it can  no longer make its debt payments  then bondholders are at risk of loss as well 
1,622,Traditional Credit Analysis  Corporate Debt Securities
2,622,   
3,622,In summary in exchange for a prior claim on cash flow and assets  bondholders  do not share in the growth in value of a company  except to the extent that its cred  itworthiness improves  but have downside risk in the event of default   In contrast   shareholders have theoretically unlimited upside opportunity but in the event of default  their investment is typically wiped out before the bondholders suffer a loss   This is  very similar to the type of payoff patterns seen in financial options   In fact  in recent  years  credit risk models  have been developed based on the insights of option pricing  theory  Although it is beyond the scope of this present introduction to the subject   it is an expanding area of interest to both institutional investors and rating agencies   Thus  although the analysis is similar in many respects for both equity and credit   equity analysts are interested in the strategies and investments that will increase a  company  s value and grow earnings per share  They then compare that earnings and  growth potential with that of other companies in a given industry  Credit analysts  will look more at the downside risk by measuring and assessing the sustainability of  a company  s cash flow relative to its debt levels and interest expense  Importantly for  credit analysts  the balance sheet will show the composition of an issuer  s debt the  overall amount  how much is coming due and when and the distribution by seniority  ranking   In general equity analysts will focus more on income and cash flow state  ments  whereas credit analysts tend to focus more on the balance sheet and cash  flow statements  
4,622,    The Four Cs of Credit Analysis  A Useful Framework
5,622,Traditionally many analysts evaluated creditworthiness based on what is often called  the  four Cs of credit analysis        Capacity    Collateral    Covenants    Character Capacity refers to the ability of the borrower to make its debt payments on time   this is the focus of this section  Collaterals refers to the quality and value of the assets  supporting the issuer  s indebtedness   Covenants are the terms and conditions of  lending agreements that the issuer must comply with  Character refers to the quality  of management   Each of these will now be covered in greater detail 
6,622,      Capacity
7,622,Capacity is the ability of a borrower to service its debt   To determine that  credit  analysis  in a process similar to equity analysis  starts with industry analysis and then  turns to examination of the specific issuer  company analysis  
8,622,   There is no unique list of Cs   In addition to those listed here one may see  capital  and or  conditions   on a particular author  s list of four  or five  Cs   Conditions typically refers to overall economic conditions    Capital refers to the company  s accumulated capital and its specific capital assets and is essentially sub  sumed within the categories of capacity and collateral  Keep in mind that the list of Cs is a convenient way  to summarize the important aspects of the analysis  not a checklist to be applied mechanically

3,623,Industry structure  A useful framework for analyzing industry structure was devel  oped by business school professor and consultant Michael Porter    The framework  considers the effects of five competitive forces on an industry     Threat of entry  Threat of entry depends on the extent of barriers to entry  and the expected response from incumbents to new entrants   Industries with  high entry barriers tend to be more profitable and have lower credit risk than  industries with low entry barriers because incumbents do not need to hold  down prices or take other steps to deter new entrants   High entry barriers can  take many forms  including high capital investment  such as in aerospace  large  established distribution systems  such as in auto dealerships   patent protection  such as in technology or pharmaceutical industries   or a high degree of regula  tion such as in utilities     Power of suppliers  An industry that relies on just a few suppliers tends to be  less profitable and to have greater credit risk than an industry that has multi  ple suppliers   Industries and companies with just a few suppliers have limited  negotiating power to keep the suppliers from raising prices  whereas industries  that have many suppliers can play them off against each other to keep prices in  check     Power of buyers customers  Industries that rely heavily on just a few main  customers have greater credit risk because the negotiating power lies with the  buyers   For example a toolmaker that sells    percent of its products to one  large global retailer has limited negotiating power with its principal customer    Threat of substitutes  Industries  and companies  that offer products and  services that provide great value to their customers  and for which there are  not good or cost  competitive substitutes  typically have strong pricing power  generate substantial cash flows  and represent less credit risk than other indus  tries or companies   Certain  patent  protected  drugs are an example  Over time  however disruptive technologies and inventions can increase substitution risk    For example years ago airplanes began displacing many trains and steamships    Newspapers were considered to have a nearly unassailable market position until  television and then the internet became substitutes for how people received  news and information  Over time recorded music has shifted from records to  tapes  to compact discs  to mp s and other forms of digital media     Rivalry among existing competitors  Industries with strong rivalry because  of numerous competitors  slow industry growth or high barriers to exit tend  to have less cash flow predictability and therefore higher credit risk than  industries with less competition  Regulation can affect the extent of rivalry and  competition  For example regulated utilities typically have a monopoly position  in a given market  which results in relatively stable and predictable cash flows    It is important to consider how companies in an industry generate revenues and  earn profits   Is it an industry with high fixed costs and capital investment or one  with modest fixed costs  These structures generate revenues and earn profits in very  different ways   Two examples of industries with high fixed costs  also referred to as   having high operating leverage  are airlines and hotels   Many of their operating costs  are fixed running a hotel flying a plane so they cannot easily cut costs   If an insuf  ficient number of people stay at a hotel or fly in a plane fixed operating costs may not  be covered and losses may result   With higher occupancy of a hotel or plane revenues  are higher and it is more likely that fixed costs will be covered and profits earned

3,624,Industry fundamentals  After understanding an industry  s structure the next step  is to assess its fundamentals  including its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors  its  growth prospects  its profitability and its business need or lack thereof for high  credit quality  Judgments about these can be made by looking at the following     Cyclical or non  cyclical  This is a crucial assessment because industries that are  cyclical that is  have greater sensitivity to broader economic performance  have more volatile revenues  margins  and cash flows and thus are inherently  riskier than non  cyclical industries   Consumer product and health care com  panies are typically considered non  cyclical whereas auto and steel companies  can be very cyclical  Companies in cyclical industries should carry lower levels  of debt relative to their ability to generate cash flow over an economic cycle  than companies in less  cyclical or non  cyclical industries      Growth prospects  Although growth is typically a greater focus for equity  analysts than for credit analysts  bond investors have an interest in growth as  well  Industries that have little or no growth tend to consolidate via mergers  and acquisitions   Depending upon how these are financed  e g   using stock or  debt  and the economic benefits  or lack thereof   of the merger they may or  may not be favorable to corporate bond investors   Weaker competitors in slow   growth industries may begin to struggle financially adversely affecting their  creditworthiness      Published industry statistics  Analysts can get an understanding of an industry  s  fundamentals and performance by researching statistics that are published by  and available from a number of different sources  including the rating agencies   investment banks  industry publications  and frequently government agencies

5,624,Competitive position  Based on their knowledge of the industry structure and fun  damentals analysts assess a company  s competitive position within the industry  What  is its market share  How has it changed over time  Is it increasing  decreasing  holding  steady  Is it well above  or below  its peers  How does it compare with respect to cost  structure  How might it change its competitive position  What sort of financing might  that require  Track record Operating history  How has the company performed over time  It s  useful to go back several years and analyze the company  s financial performance per  haps during times of both economic growth and contraction  What are the trends in  revenues  profit margins  and cash flow  Capital expenditures represent what percent  of revenues  What are the trends on the balance sheet use of debt versus equity  Was  this track record developed under the current management team  If not when did the  current management team take over  Management s strategy and execution  What is management s strategy for the  company   to compete and to grow  Does it make sense and is it plausible  How risky  is it and how differentiated is it from its industry peers  Is it venturing into unrelated  businesses  Does the analyst have confidence in management s ability to execute  What

5,625,Industry and Company Analysis
6,625,  Given a hotel company a chemical company and a consumer products  company which is most likely to be able to support a high debt load over  an economic cycle  A The hotel company because people need a place to stay when they  travel  B The chemical company because chemicals are a key input to many  products   C The consumer products company because consumer products are  typically resistant to recessions     Heavily regulated monopoly companies  such as utilities  often carry high  debt loads   Which of the following statements about such companies is  most accurate  A Regulators require them to carry high debt loads   B They generate strong and stable cash flows  enabling them to support  high levels of debt   C They are not very profitable and need to borrow heavily to maintain  their plant and equipment     XYZ Corp  manufactures a commodity product in a highly competitive  industry in which no company has significant market share and where  there are low barriers to entry  Which of the following best describes  XYZ s ability to take on substantial debt  A  Its ability is very limited because companies in industries with those  characteristics generally cannot support high debt loads   Its ability is high because companies in industries with those charac  teristics generally have high margins and cash flows that can support  significant debt   C We don t have enough information to answer the question 
7,625,B
8,625,Solution to   
9,625,C is correct  Consumer products companies are considered non  cyclical whereas  hotel and chemical companies are more cyclical and thus more vulnerable to  economic downturns  
10,625,Solution to   
11,625,B is correct   Because such monopolies  financial returns are generally dictated  by the regulators  they generate consistent cash flows and are therefore able  to support high debt levels

2,626,   
3,626,Solution to   
4,626,A is correct   Companies in industries with those characteristics typically have  low margins and limited cash flow and thus cannot support high debt levels  
5,626,Ratios and ratio analysis  To provide context to the analysis and understanding of a  company  s fundamentals based on the industry in which it operates  its competitive  position its strategy and execution a number of financial measures derived from the  company  s principal financial statements are examined  Credit analysts calculate a num  ber of ratios to assess the financial health of a company identify trends over time and  compare companies across an industry to get a sense of relative creditworthiness  Note  that typical values of these ratios vary widely from one industry to another because of  different industry characteristics previously identified  competitive structure economic  cyclicality regulation and so on  We will categorize the key credit analysis measures into three different groups      Profitability and cash flow    Leverage    Coverage
6,626,Profitability and cash flow measures 
7,626,It is from profitability and cash flow generation  that companies can service their debt  Credit analysts typically look at operating profit  margins and operating income to get a sense of a company  s underlying profitability  and see how it varies over time  Operating income is defined as operating revenues  minus operating expenses and is commonly referred to as  earnings before interest  and taxes   EBIT   Credit analysts focus on EBIT because it is useful to determine a  company  s performance prior to costs arising from its capital structure  i e  how much  debt it carries versus equity   And  before taxes  is used because interest expense is  paid before income taxes are calculated  There are several measures of cash flow used in credit analysis   some are more  conservative than others because they make certain adjustments for cash that gets used  in managing and maintaining the business or in making payments to shareholders   The  cash flow measures and leverage and coverage ratios discussed below are non  IFRS  in the sense that they do not have official IFRS definitions   the concepts  names  and  definitions given should be viewed as one usage among several possible in most cases  
8,626,   Earnings before interest  taxes depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  
9,626,EBITDA is a commonly used measure of cash flow that takes operating income  and adds back depreciation and amortization expense because those are non   cash items   This is a somewhat crude measure of cash flow because it excludes  certain cash  related expenses of running a business  such as capital expendi  tures and changes in  non  cash  working capital  Thus  despite its popularity as  a cash flow measure analysts look at other measures in addition to EBITDA      Funds from operations  FFO   Standard   Poor  s defines funds from opera  tions as net income from continuing operations plus depreciation amortization  deferred income taxes  and other non  cash items    
10,626,   The funds from operations differs only slightly from the better known cash flow from operations in  that it excludes working capital changes   The idea behind using FFO in credit analysis is to take out the  near  term swings and seasonality in working capital that can potentially distort the amount of operating  cash flow a business is generating   Over time the working capital swings are expected to even out   Analysts  tend to look at both FFO and cash flow from operations  particularly for businesses with large working  capital swings  e g   very cyclical manufacturing companies

2,627,Reading      Fundamentals of Credit Analysis
3,627,   Free cash flow before dividends  FCF before dividends     This measures
4,627,excess cash flow generated by the company  excluding non  recurring items   before payments to shareholders or that could be used to pay down debt or pay  dividends   It can be calculated as net income  excluding non  recurring items   plus depreciation and amortization minus increase  plus decrease  in non  cash  working capital minus capital expenditures   This is  depending upon the treat  ment of dividends and interest in the cash flow statement  approximated by the  cash flow from operating activities minus capital expenditures   Companies that  have negative free cash flow before payments to shareholders will be consuming  cash they have or will need to rely on additional financing from banks  bond  investors  or equity investors   This obviously represents higher credit risk  
5,627,   Free cash flow after dividends  FCF after dividends   This measure just takes
6,627,free cash flow before dividends and subtracts dividend payments   If this number  is positive it represents cash that could be used to pay down debt or build up  cash on the balance sheet   Either action may be viewed as deleveraging  which  is favorable from a credit risk standpoint   Some credit analysts will calculate net  debt by subtracting balance sheet cash from total debt  although they shouldn t  assume the cash will be used to pay down debt   Actual debt paid down from  free cash flow is a better indicator of deleveraging   Some analysts will also  deduct stock buybacks to get the  truest  measure of free cash flow that can be  used to de  lever on either a gross or net debt basis   however others view stock  buybacks  share repurchases  as more discretionary and as having less certain  timing than dividends  and thus treat those two types of shareholder payments  differently when calculating free cash flow 
7,627,Leverage ratios  There are a few measures of leverage used by credit analysts   The  most common are the debt capital debt EBITDA  and measures of funds or cash  flows debt ratios   Note that many analysts adjust a company  s reported debt levels for  debt  like liabilities such as underfunded pensions and other retiree benefits as well as  operating leases  When adjusting for leases analysts will typically add back the imputed  interest or rent expense to various cash flow measures      Debt capital  Capital is calculated as total debt plus shareholders equity  This  ratio shows the percent of a company  s capital base that is financed with debt    A lower percentage of debt indicates lower credit risk   This traditional ratio  is generally used for investment  grade corporate issuers   Where goodwill or  other intangible assets are significant  and subject to obsolescence depletion  or impairment  it is often informative to also compute the debt to capital ratio  after assuming a write  down of the after  tax value of such assets      Debt EBITDA   This ratio is a common leverage measure  Analysts use it on a   snapshot  basis  as well as to look at trends over time and at projections and to  compare companies in a given industry  Rating agencies often use it as a trigger  for rating actions  and banks reference it in loan covenants   A higher ratio indi  cates more leverage and thus higher credit risk   Note that this ratio can be very  volatile for companies with high cash flow variability such as those in cyclical  industries and with high operating leverage  fixed costs  
8,627,   This is similar to free cash flow to the firm  FCFF  referred to in the Level I CFA Program reading   Understanding Cash Flow Statements

3,628,   FFO debt  Credit rating agencies often use this leverage ratio  They publish key  median and average ratios  such as this one by rating category so analysts can  get a sense of why an issuer is assigned a certain credit rating  as well as where  that rating may migrate based on changes to such key ratios as this one  A  higher ratio indicates greater ability to pay debt by funds from operations      FCF after dividends debt  A higher ratio indicates that a greater amount of  debt can be paid off from free cash flow after dividend payments  
4,628,Coverage ratios  Coverage ratios measure an issuer  s ability to meet to  cover  its  interest payments  The two most common are the EBITDA interest expense and EBIT  interest expense ratios      EBITDA interest expense  This measurement of interest coverage is a bit more  liberal than the one that uses EBIT because it does not subtract out the impact  of  non  cash  depreciation and amortization expense  A higher ratio indicates  higher credit quality     EBIT interest expense  Because EBIT does not include depreciation and  amortization it is considered a more conservative measure of interest coverage   This ratio is now used less frequently than EBITDA interest expense  Exhibit   is an example of key average credit ratios by rating category for industrial  companies over a three  year period as published by Standard   Poor  s

3,629,Comments on issuer liquidity  An issuer  s access to liquidity is also an important  consideration in credit analysis   Companies with high liquidity represent lower credit  risk than those with weak liquidity other factors being equal  The financial crisis of            showed that access to liquidity via the debt and equity markets should not  be taken for granted particularly for companies that do not have strong balance sheets  or steady operating cash flow  When assessing an issuer  s liquidity credit analysts tend to look at the following     Cash on the balance sheet  Cash holdings provide the greatest assurance of  having sufficient liquidity to make promised payments      Net working capital  The big US automakers used to have enormous nega  tive working capital despite having high levels of cash on the balance sheet    This proved disastrous when the financial crisis hit in      and the economy  contracted sharply  Auto sales and thus revenues fell the auto companies  cut production and working capital consumed billions of dollars in cash as  accounts payable came due when the companies most needed liquidity     Operating cash flow  Analysts will project this figure out a few years and con  sider the risk that it may be lower than expected     Committed bank lines  Committed but untapped lines of credit provide con  tingent liquidity in the event that the company is unable to tap other potentially  cheaper financing in the public debt markets  
4,629,   Debt coming due and committed capital expenditures in the next one to
5,629,two years  Analysts will compare the sources of liquidity with the amount of  debt coming due as well as with committed capital expenditures to ensure that  companies can repay their debt and still invest in the business if the capital  markets are somehow not available  As will be discussed in more detail in the section on special considerations for  high  yield credits  issuer liquidity is a bigger consideration for high  yield companies  than for investment grade companies

28,636,      Collateral
29,636,Collateral or asset value analysis is typically emphasized more with lower credit  quality companies   As discussed earlier credit analysts focus primarily on probability  of default  which is mostly about an issuer  s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to  support its debt payments  as well as its ability to refinance maturing debt   Only when  the default probability rises to a sufficient level do analysts typically consider asset or  collateral value in the context of loss severity in the event of default   Analysts do think about the value and quality of a company  s assets   however these  are difficult to observe directly  Factors to consider include the nature and amount  of intangible assets on the balance sheet   Some assets  such as patents  are clearly  valuable and can be sold if necessary to cover liabilities   Goodwill on the other hand  is not considered a high  quality asset   In fact  sustained weak financial performance  most likely implies that a company  s goodwill will be written down reinforcing its  poor quality  Another factor to consider is the amount of depreciation an issuer takes  relative to its capital expenditures   Low capital expenditures relative to depreciation

3,637,expense could imply that management is insufficiently investing in its business  which  will lead to lower  quality assets  potentially reduced future operating cash flow and  higher loss severity in the event of default   A market  based signal that credit analysts use to impute the quality of a publicly  traded company  s assets  and its ability to support its debt  is equity market capi  talization  For instance a company whose stock trades below book value may have  lower  quality assets than is suggested by the amount reported on the balance sheet   As economies become more service  and knowledge  based and those types of  companies issue debt  it s important to understand that these issuers rely more on  human and intellectual capital than on  hard assets    In generating profits and cash  flow these companies are not as asset intensive  One example would be software  companies   Another example would be investment management firms   Human  and  intellectual  capital  based companies may generate a lot of cash flow but their col  lateral value is questionable unless there are patents and other types of intellectual  property and  intangible capital  that may not appear directly on the balance sheet  but could be valuable in the event of financial distress or default   Regardless of the nature of the business  the key point of collateral analysis is to  assess the value of the assets relative to the issuer  s level and seniority ranking of  debt  
4,637,      Covenants
5,637,Covenants are meant to protect creditors while also giving management sufficient  flexibility to operate its business on behalf of and for the benefit of the shareholders    They are integral to credit agreements  whether they are bonds or bank loans  and  they spell out what the issuer  s management is     obligated to do and     limited in  doing   The former are called  affirmative covenants   whereas the latter are called   negative  or  restrictive covenants    Obligations would include such duties as making  interest and principal payments and filing audited financial statements on a timely  basis   Covenants might also require a company to redeem debt in the event of the  company being acquired   or to keep the ratio of debt to EBITDA below some pre  scribed amount  The limitations might include a cap on the amount of cash that can be  paid out to shareholders relative to earnings  or perhaps on the amount of additional  secured debt that can be issued  Covenant violations are a breach of contract and can be  considered default events unless they are cured in a short time or a waiver is granted  For corporate bonds  covenants are described in the bond prospectus the doc  ument that is part of a new bond issue  The prospectus describes the terms of the  bond issue as well as supporting financial statements  to help investors perform  their analyses and make investment decisions as to whether or not to submit orders  to buy the new bonds   Actually the trust deed or bond indenture is the governing  legal credit agreement and is typically incorporated by reference in the prospectus   Covenants are an important but underappreciated part of credit analysis   Strong  covenants protect bond investors from the possibility of management taking actions  that would hurt an issuer  s creditworthiness   For example without appropriate cove  nants management might pay large dividends  undertake stock buybacks well in excess  of free cash flow sell the company in a leveraged buyout    or take on a lot of secured  debt that structurally subordinates unsecured bondholders   All of these actions would  enrich shareholders at the expense of bondholders   Recall that management works for

3,638,the shareholders and that bonds are contracts  with management s only real obligation  to creditors being to uphold the terms of the contract   The inclusion of covenants in  the contract is intended to protect bondholders   The bond  buying investor base is very large and diverse particularly for investment   grade debt  It includes institutional investors such as insurance companies  investment  management firms  pension funds  mutual funds  hedge funds  sovereign wealth funds   and so on  Although there are some very large institutional investors  the buyer base  is fragmented and does not and legally cannot act as a syndicate  Thus  bondhold  ers are generally not able to negotiate strong covenants on most new bond issues    Covenants on new bond issues tend to be stronger during weak economic or market  conditions because investors seek more protection during such times   There are a  few organized institutional investor groups focused on strengthening covenants   the  Credit Roundtable   in the United States and the European Model Covenant Initiative  in the United Kingdom  Covenant language is often very technical and written in  legalese  so it can be  helpful to have an in  house person with a legal background to review and interpret  the specific covenant terms and wording   One might also use a third  party service  specializing in covenant analysis  such as Covenant Review    We will go into more detail on specific covenants in the section on special con  siderations for high  yield bonds  
4,638,      Character
5,638,The character of a corporate borrower can be difficult to observe  The analysis of  character as a factor in credit analysis dates to when loans were made to compa  nies owned by individuals   Most corporate bond issuers are now publicly owned  by shareholders or privately owned by pools of capital such as private equity firms    Management often has little ownership in a corporation so analysis and assessment  of character is different than it would be for owner  managed firms   Credit analysts  can make judgments about management s character in the following ways      An assessment of the soundness of management s strategy     Management s track record in executing past strategies  particularly if they led  to bankruptcy or restructuring   A company run by executives whose prior posi  tions ventures resulted in significant distress might still be able to borrow in the  debt markets  but it would likely have to borrow on a secured basis and or pay a  higher rate of interest      Use of aggressive accounting policies and or tax strategies   Examples might  include using a significant amount of off  balance  sheet financing  capitalizing  versus immediately expensing items  recognizing revenue prematurely and or  frequently changing auditors   These are potential warning flags to other behav  iors or actions that may adversely impact an issuer  s creditworthiness      Any history of fraud or malfeasance a major warning flag to credit analysts      Previous poor treatment of bondholders for example management actions  that resulted in major credit rating downgrades   These actions might include a  debt  financed acquisition a large special dividend to shareholders  or a major  debt  financed stock buyback program

8,639,Solution to   
9,639,B is correct   Covenants describe what the borrower is     obligated to do or      limited in doing   It s the absence of covenants that would permit a company  to buy back as much stock as it likes   A requirement that the company offer  security to this bond issue if it offers security to other creditors  answer C  is  referred to as a  negative pledge

22,640,Source   Based on data from Barclays  
23,640,Note that the lower the credit quality the higher the quoted yield  The realized  yield or return will almost always be different because of changes in interest rates  and the credit  related risks discussed earlier  For example in the aggregate credit  losses will  eat up  some of the yield premium offered by lower  quality bonds versus  higher  quality credits   Trailing     month returns by credit rating category and the  volatility  standard deviation  of those returns  are shown in Exhibit    
24,640,   High  yield bonds are often quoted on a  yield to call   YTC  or  yield to worst   YTW   basis because  so many of them are callable before maturity whereas most investment  grade bonds are non  callable or  at least callable at such punitive premiums that issuers are not likely to exercise that option

55,641,As shown in the exhibit  the higher the credit risk  the greater the return potential  and the higher the volatility of that return  This pattern is consistent with other types  of investing that involves risk and return  although average returns on single  B rated  bonds appear anomalous in this example   For extremely liquid bonds that are deemed to have virtually no default risk  e g    German government bonds  or Bunds  the yield is a function of real interest rates  plus an expected inflation rate and a maturity premium  Of course those factors are  present in corporate bonds as well  In addition the yield on corporate bonds will  include a liquidity premium and a credit spread intended to compensate investors  for these additional risks as well as for the expected level of credit losses   Thus  the  yield on a corporate bond can be decomposed as Yield on corporate bond   Real risk  free interest rate   Expected inflation rate    Maturity premium   Liquidity premium   Credit  spread Changes in any of these components will alter the yield price and return on the bond  Investors in corporate bonds focus primarily on the yield spread relative to a  comparable default  free bond which is composed of the liquidity premium and the  credit spread  Yield spread   Liquidity premium   Credit spread

5,642,The market s willingness to bear risk will affect each of these components   In general  however it is not possible to directly observe the market s assessment of the compo  nents separately analysts can only observe the total yield spread  Spreads on all corporate bonds can be affected by a number of factors  with lower   quality issuers typically experiencing greater spread volatility  These factors  which  are frequently linked include the following     Credit cycle  As the credit cycle improves  credit spreads will narrow   Conversely a deteriorating credit cycle will cause credit spreads to widen   Spreads are tightest at or near the top of the credit cycle when financial mar  kets believe risk is low whereas they are widest at or near the bottom of the  credit cycle when financial markets believe risk is high     Broader economic conditions  Not surprisingly weakening economic con  ditions will push investors to desire a greater risk premium and drive overall  credit spreads wider  Conversely a strengthening economy will cause credit  spreads to narrow because investors anticipate credit measures will improve  due to rising corporate cash flow thus reducing the risk of default

8,644,We have discussed how yield spreads on credit  risky debt obligations  such as  corporate bonds  can fluctuate based on a number of factors  including changes in  the market s view of issuer  specific or idiosyncratic risk   The next question to ask is  how these spread changes affect the price of and return on these bonds   Although bond investors do concern themselves with default risks  recall that the  probability of default for higher  quality bonds is typically very low   For investment   grade bonds  annual defaults are nearly always well below   percent  recall Exhibit      On the other hand default rates can be very high for lower  quality issuers  although  they can vary widely depending upon the credit cycle among other things   What most  investors in investment  grade debt focus on more than default risk is spread risk that  is  the effect on prices and returns from changes in spreads   The price impact from spread changes is driven by two main factors   the modified  duration  price sensitivity with respect to changes in interest rates  of the bond and  the magnitude of the spread change  The effect on return to the bondholder depends  on the holding period used for calculating the return  The simplest example is that of a small instantaneous change in the yield spread   In this case the price impact  i e  the percentage change in price  including accrued  interest  can be approximated by Price impact     MDur    Spread where MDur is the modified duration  The negative sign in this equation reflects the  fact that because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions  narrower spreads  have a positive impact on bond prices and thus returns  whereas wider spreads have a  negative impact on bond returns   Note that if the spread change is expressed in basis  points  then the price impact will also be in basis points  whereas if the spread change  is expressed as a decimal the price impact will also be expressed as a decimal  Either  way the result is easily re  expressed as a percent   For larger spread changes  and thus larger yield changes  the impact of convexity  needs to be incorporated into the approximation  Price impact     MDur    Spread     Cvx     Spread   In this case one must be careful to ensure that convexity  denoted by Cvx  is appropri  ately scaled to be consistent with the way the spread change is expressed  In general  for bonds without embedded options  one can scale convexity so that it has the same  order of magnitude as the duration squared and then express the spread change as a

3,645,decimal  For example for a bond with duration of     and reported convexity of        one would re  scale convexity to      before applying the formula   For a   percent  i e       bps  increase in spread the result would be Price impact                                                  or          percent The price impact of instantaneous spread changes is illustrated in Exhibit    using  two bonds from British Telecom the UK telecommunications company  The bonds   denominated in British pounds  are priced to provide a certain spread over British  government bonds  gilts  of a similar maturity  From the starting spread in increments  of    bps and for both wider and narrower spreads  the new price and actual return  for each spread change are calculated  In addition the exhibit shows the approximate  returns with and without the convexity term  As can be seen the approximation using  only duration is reasonably accurate for small spread changes but for larger changes   the convexity term generally provides a meaningful improvement

14,646,Note that the price change for a given spread change is higher for the longer   duration bond in this case the      maturity British Telecom bond than for the  shorter  duration bond  Longer  duration corporate bonds are referred to as having   higher spread sensitivity    that is  their prices  and thus returns  are more volatile  with respect to changes in spread  It is essentially the same concept as duration for  any bond  The longer the duration of a bond the greater the price volatility for a given  change in interest rates yields   In addition investors want to be compensated for the fact that the further one is  from a bond s maturity  i e  the longer the bond  the greater the uncertainty about  an issuer  s future creditworthiness   Based on credit analysis  an investor might be  confident that an issuer  s risk of default is relatively low in the near term  however  looking many years into the future the investor  s uncertainty grows because of factors  that are increasingly difficult  if not impossible to forecast  e g   poor management  strategy or execution technological obsolescence natural or man  made disasters   corporate leveraging events   This increase in credit risk over time can be seen in  Exhibit     Note that in this Standard   Poor  s study   one  year default rates for the       issuance pool are   percent for all rating categories of B  or higher  The three   year default rates for bonds issued in      are materially higher and the observed  defaults include bonds originally rated up to BBB   i e  low investment grade   The      year default rates for bonds issued in      are appreciably higher than the    year  default rates  and the defaults include bonds initially rated as high as A   i e  solid  investment grade   In addition to the risk of default rising over time the data also  show quite conclusively that the lower the credit rating  the higher the risk of default    Finally note the very high risk of default for bonds rated CCC or lower over all time  horizons   This is consistent with Exhibit   earlier in the reading  which showed sig  nificant three  year ratings variability   migration   with much of the migration to  lower credit ratings  i e  higher risk of default

14,647,It is also worth noting that bid ask spreads  in yield terms  translate into higher  transaction costs for longer  duration bonds  investors want to be compensated for that  as well  For these reasons  spread curves  often called credit curves  like yield curves   are typically upward sloping   That is  longer  maturity bonds of a given issuer typically  trade at wider spreads than shorter  maturity bonds to their respective comparable   maturity government bonds     Exhibit    using the US telecommunications company  AT T as an example shows the upward  sloping credit curve by plotting the yields  of its bonds versus their maturity   As a large and frequent issuer AT T has many  bonds outstanding across the yield curve  
15,647,   There are some exceptions to this bonds that trade at a high premium price over par due to having  coupons that are well above the bond s yield to maturity and bonds that trade at distressed levels due to  credit concerns   Many investors are averse to paying high premium prices for bonds that have credit risk  because of the greater potential price decline towards a recovery price in the event of default from a  credit  adverse event   Thus  high  coupon intermediate  maturity bonds can trade at similar or wider spreads  to longer  maturity bonds   For distressed credits  the high risk of default causes all bonds for a given issuer  to migrate toward the same expected recovery price  In this case the shorter  maturity and shorter  duration  bonds will have a higher quoted yield to maturity and wider spread than the longer  maturity and longer   duration bonds   This follows from the price impact formulas   The shorter the duration the higher the yield   including spread  must go to bring the price down to a given expected recovery price

28,648,Because yields and bond prices move in opposite directions  the wider spread  caused the bond price to fall  Using a bond  pricing calculator the exact return  is       percent  so this approximation was very accurate

4,649,SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS OF HIGH  YIELD  SOVEREIGN AND NON  SOVEREIGN CREDIT ANALYSIS
5,649,Thus far we have focused primarily on basic principles of credit analysis and investing  with emphasis on higher  quality investment  grade corporate bonds   Although many  of these principles are applicable to other credit  risky segments of the bond market   there are some differences in credit analysis that need to be considered  This section  focuses on special considerations in evaluating the credit of debt issuers from the  following three market segments   high  yield corporate bonds  sovereign bonds  and  non  sovereign government bonds  
6,649,    High Yield
7,649,Recall that high  yield or non  investment  grade corporate bonds are those rated below  Baa  BBB  by the major rating agencies   These bonds are sometimes referred to as   junk bonds  because of the higher risk inherent in their weak balance sheets and or  poor or less  proven business prospects   There are many reasons companies are rated below investment grade including    Highly leveraged capital structure    Weak or limited operating history    Limited or negative free cash flow    Highly cyclical business    Poor management    Risky financial policies    Lack of scale and or competitive advantages    Large off  balance  sheet liabilities    Declining industry  e g   newspaper publishing  Companies with weak balance sheets and or business profiles have lower margin  for error and greater risk of default relative to higher  quality investment  grade names    And the higher risk of default means more attention must be paid to recovery analysis   or loss severity in the event of default   Consequently high  yield analysis typically  is more in  depth than investment  grade analysis and thus has special considerations    This includes the following     Greater focus on issuer liquidity and cash flow    Detailed financial projections    Detailed understanding and analysis of the debt structure    Understanding of an issuer  s corporate structure    Covenants    Equity  like approach to high yield analysis
8,649,Liquidity  Liquidity that is having cash and or the ability to generate or raise cash is  important to all issuers   It is absolutely critical for high  yield companies   Investment   grade companies typically have substantial cash on their balance sheets  generate a  lot of cash from operations relative to their debt  or else they wouldn t be investment  grade   and or are presumed to have alternate sources of liquidity such as bank lines

3,650,and commercial paper    For these reasons  investment  grade companies can more  easily roll over  refinance  maturing debt  On the other hand high  yield companies  may not have those options available  For example there is no high  yield commercial  paper market and bank credit facilities often carry tighter restrictions for high  yield  companies   Both bad company  specific news and difficult financial market conditions  can lead to high  yield companies being unable to access the debt markets  And although  the vast majority of investment  grade corporate debt issuers have publicly traded equity  and can thus use that equity as a financing option many high  yield companies are  privately held and thus don t have access to public equity markets   Thus  issuer liquidity is a key focus in high  yield analysis   Sources of liquidity from  strongest to weakest  are the following    Cash on the balance sheet   Working capital   Operating cash flow   Bank credit facilities   Equity issuance   Asset sales Cash on the balance sheet is easy to see and self  evident as a source for repaying  debt     As mentioned earlier in this reading  working capital can be a large source  or use of liquidity depending on its amount  its use in a company  s cash  conversion  cycle and its role in a company  s operations   Operating cash flow is a ready source  of liquidity as sales turn to receivables  which turn to cash over a fairly short time  period  Bank lines  or credit facilities  can be an important source of liquidity though  there may be some covenants relating to the use of the bank lines which are crucial to  know and will be covered a little later  Equity issuance may not be a reliable source of  liquidity because an issuer is private or because of poor market conditions if a company  does have publicly traded equity  Asset sales are the least reliable source of liquidity  because both the potential value and the actual time of closing can be highly uncertain  The amount of these liquidity sources should be compared with the amount  and timing of upcoming debt maturities   A large amount of debt coming due in the  next      months alongside low sources of liquidity will be a warning flag for bond  investors and could push an issuer into default because investors may choose not to  buy new bonds intended to pay off the existing debt   Insufficient liquidity that is   running out of cash or no longer having access to external financing to refinance or  pay off existing debt is the principal reason issuers default   Although liquidity is  important for industrial companies  it is an absolute necessity for financial firms  as  seen in the case of Lehman Brothers and other troubled firms during the financial  crisis of       Financial institutions are highly levered and often highly dependent on  funding longer  term assets with short  term term liabilities   Financial Projections  Because high  yield companies have less room for error it s  important to forecast or project future earnings and cash flow out several years  per  haps including several scenarios  to assess whether the issuer  s credit profile is stable  improving  or declining and thus whether it needs other sources of liquidity or is at

12,651,   Because of the higher risk of default  in most instances bank debt will be secured for high  yield issuers      Convertible bonds are debt instruments that give holders the option to convert to a fixed number  of shares of common stock   They can be at any level of the capital structure but are frequently issued as  senior subordinated debt      Preferred stock has elements of both debt and equity  It typically receives a fixed payment like a bond  does and has higher priority of claims than common stock   As a type of equity however it is subordinated  to debt

4,653,Freescale might have that much secured debt because     it was less expensive  than issuing additional unsecured debt on which investors would have demanded  a higher yield and or     given the riskiness of the business  semiconductors that  are sold into cyclical industries  such as autos  the leverage of the business model  and the riskiness of the balance sheet  lots of debt from a leveraged buyout   investors would only lend the company money on a secured basis  
5,653,High  yield companies that have a lot of secured debt  typically bank debt  relative  to unsecured debt are said to have a  top  heavy  capital structure  With this structure  there is less capacity to take on more bank debt in the event of financial stress   Along  with the often more stringent covenants associated with bank debt and its generally  shorter maturity compared with other types of debt  this means that these issuers are  more susceptible to default  as well as to lower recovery for the various less secured  creditors   Corporate Structure  Many debt  issuing corporations including high  yield companies  utilize a holding company structure with a parent and several operating subsidiaries    Knowing where an issuer  s debt resides  parent versus subsidiaries  and how cash can  move from subsidiary to parent   upstream   and vice versa   downstream   are critical  to the analysis of high  yield issuers   In a holding company structure the parent owns stock in its subsidiaries   Typically  the parent doesn t generate much of its own earnings or cash flow but instead receives  dividends from its subsidiaries   The subsidiaries  dividends are generally paid out of  earnings after they satisfy of all their other obligations  such as debt payments   To the  extent that their earnings and cash flow are weak  subsidiaries may be limited in their  ability to pay dividends to the parent   Moreover subsidiaries that carry a lot of their  own debt may have restrictions or limitations on how much cash they can provide to  the parent via dividends or in another way such as through an intercompany loan   These restrictions and limitations on cash moving between parent and subsidiaries  can have a major impact on their respective abilities to meet their debt obligations    The parent s reliance on cash flow from its subsidiaries means the parent s debt is  structurally subordinated to the subsidiaries  debt and thus will usually have a lower  recovery rating in default   For companies with very complex holding companies  there may also be one or  more intermediate holding companies  each carrying their own debt and in some cases   they may not own     percent of the subsidiaries  stock   This structure is sometimes  seen in high  yield companies that have been put together through many mergers and  acquisitions or that were part of a leveraged buyout     Exhibit    returns to United Rentals  Inc   URI  a high  yield company highlighted  earlier as an example of the credit rating agency notching process   URI has a capital  structure consisting of a parent company that has debt in this case convertible  senior notes as well as subsidiaries with outstanding debt   And in the case of URI s  United Rentals North America subsidiary it has several layers of debt by seniority

19,654,Thus  high  yield investors should analyze and understand an issuer  s corporate  structure including the distribution of debt between the parent and its subsidiaries    Leverage ratios should be calculated at each of the debt  issuing entities  as well as on  a consolidated basis   Also important is that although the debt of an operating subsidiary may be  closer  to  and better secured by particular assets of the subsidiary the credit quality of a  parent company might still be higher  The parent company could while being less  directly secured by any particular assets  still benefit from the diversity and availability  of all the cash flows in the consolidated system  In short  credit quality is not simply  an automatic analysis of debt provisions and liens   Covenant Analysis  As discussed earlier analysis of covenants is very important for all  bonds  It is especially important for high  yield credits because of their reduced margin  of safety  Key covenants for high  yield issuers may include the following     Change of control put    Restricted payments    Limitations on liens and additional indebtedness    Restricted versus unrestricted subsidiaries Under the change of control put in the event of an acquisition  a  change of  control   bondholders have the right to require the issuer to buy back their debt  a   put option   often at par or at some small premium to par value  This covenant is  intended to protect creditors from being exposed to a weaker more indebted bor  rower as a result of acquisition  For investment  grade issuers  this covenant typically  has a two  pronged test   acquisition of the borrower and a consequent downgrade to  a high  yield rating

2,655,Reading      Fundamentals of Credit Analysis
3,655,The restricted payments covenant is meant to protect creditors by limiting how  much cash can be paid out to shareholders over time  The restricted payments  basket   is typically sized relative to an issuer  s cash flow and debt outstanding or is being  raised and is an amount that can grow with retained earnings or cash flow giving  management more flexibility to make pay  outs   The limitations on liens covenant is meant to put limits on how much secured  debt an issuer can have  This covenant is important to unsecured creditors who are  structurally subordinated to secured creditors   the higher the amount of debt that is  layered ahead of them the less they stand to recover in the event of default  
4,655,With regard to restricted versus unrestricted subsidiaries issuers may classify
5,655,certain of their subsidiaries as restricted and others as unrestricted as it pertains to  offering guarantees for their holding company debt   These subsidiary guarantees can  be very useful to holding company creditors because they put their debt on equal  standing  pari passu  with debt at the subsidiaries instead of with structurally subor  dinated debt  Restricted subsidiaries should be thought of as those that are designated  to help service parent  level debt  typically through guarantees   They tend to be an  issuer  s larger subsidiaries and have significant assets  such as plants and other facilities   and or cash flow  There may be tax or legal  e g   country of domicile  reasons why  certain subsidiaries are restricted while others are not   Analysts should carefully read  the definitions of restricted versus unrestricted subsidiaries in the indenture because  sometimes the language is so loosely written that the company can reclassify subsid  iaries from one type to another with a simple vote by a board of directors or trustees   For high  yield investors  it is also important to know what covenants are in an  issuer  s bank credit agreements   These agreements are typically filed with the securities  commission in the country where the loan document was drafted  Bank covenants  can be more restrictive than bond covenants and may include so  called maintenance  covenants such as leverage tests  whereby the ratio of say debt EBITDA may not  exceed  x  times   In the event a covenant is breached the bank is likely to block  further loans under the agreement until the covenant is cured  If not cured the bank  may accelerate full payment of the facility triggering a default  
6,655,Equity  like approach to high  yield analysis  High  yield bonds are sometimes thought
7,655,of as a  hybrid  between higher  quality bonds  such as investment  grade corporate  debt and equity securities   Their more volatile price and spread movements are less  influenced by interest rate changes than are higher  quality bonds  and they show  greater correlation with movements in equity markets  Indeed as shown in Exhibit     historical returns on high  yield bonds and the standard deviation of those returns fall  somewhere between investment  grade bonds and equities

21,656,Consequently an equity market  like approach to analyzing a high  yield issuer can  be useful  One approach is to calculate an issuer  s enterprise value  Enterprise value   EV   is usually calculated by adding equity market capitalization and total debt and  then subtracting excess cash      Enterprise value is a measure of what a business is  worth  before any takeover premium  because an acquirer of the company would have  to either pay off or assume the debt and it would receive the acquired company  s cash  Bond investors like using EV because it shows the amount of equity  cushion   beneath the debt   It can also give a sense of     how much more leverage manage  ment might attempt to put on a company in an effort to increase equity returns or      how likely and how expensive a credit  damaging leveraged buyout might be   Similar to how stock investors look at equity multiples  bond investors may calculate  and compare EV EBITDA and debt EBITDA across several issuers as part of their  analysis   Narrow differences between the EV EBITDA and debt EBITDA ratios for  a given issuer indicate a small equity cushion and therefore potentially higher risk  for bond investors

24,656,   Excess cash takes total cash and subtracts any negative working capital     Unlike the vast majority of investment  grade companies  many high  yield issuers do not have publicly  traded equity  For those issuers  one can use comparable public company equity data to estimate EV

3,657,for some of the highest  quality government borrowers   As their capital markets have  developed an increasing number of sovereign governments have been able to issue  debt in foreign markets  generally denominated in a currency other than that of the  sovereign government  often the US dollar or euro  as well as debt in the domestic  market  issued in the sovereign government s own currency   Generally sovereign  governments with weak currencies can only access foreign debt markets by issuing  bonds in foreign currencies that are viewed to be safer stores of value  Debt issued  in the domestic market is somewhat easier to service because the debt is typically  denominated in the country  s own currency subject to its own laws  and money can  be printed to service the sovereign government s domestic debt   Twenty years ago  many emerging market countries   could only issue debt in foreign markets because  a domestic market did not exist   Today many are able to issue debt domestically and  have successfully built yield curves of domestic bonds across the maturity spectrum   All sovereign governments are best able to service foreign and domestic debt if they  run  twin surpluses  that is  a government budget surplus as well as a current  account surplus    Despite ongoing financial globalization and the development of domestic bond  markets  sovereign government defaults occur  Defaults are often precipitated by such  events as war political upheaval major currency devaluation a sharp deterioration in  trade or dramatic price declines in a country  s key commodity exports   Default risks  for some developed countries escalated after      as government revenues dropped  precipitously following the financial crisis of      expenditures surged and financial  markets focused on the long  term sustainability of public finances  given aging popu  lations and rising social security needs   Some of the weaker and more highly indebted  members of the eurozone became unable to access the debt markets at economical  rates and had to seek loans from the International Monetary Fund  IMF  and the  European Union  These weaker governments had previously been able to borrow at  much lower rates because of their membership in the European Union and adoption  of the euro  Intra  eurozone yield spreads widened and countries were shut out of mar  kets  however as the global financial crisis exacted a high toll on their public finances  and in some cases  their banking systems  which became contingent liabilities for the  sovereigns   In Ireland the government guaranteed most bank liabilities  causing the  country  s debt burden to increase dramatically  Like corporate analysis  sovereign credit analysis is based on a combination of  qualitative and quantitative factors   Ultimately the two key issues for sovereign anal  ysis are    a government s ability to pay and    its willingness to pay  Willingness to  pay is important because due to the principle of sovereign immunity investors are  generally unable to force a sovereign to pay its debts   Sovereign immunity prevents  governments from being sued  To illustrate the most important considerations in sovereign credit analysis  we  present a basic framework for evaluating sovereign credit and assigning sovereign  debt ratings     The framework highlights the specific characteristics analysts should  expect in a high  quality sovereign credit   Some of these are self  explanatory  e g    absence of corruption   For others  a brief rationale and or range of values is included  to clarify interpretation  Most  but not all of these items are included in rating agency  Standard   Poor  s methodology

5,661,    Non  Sovereign Government Debt
6,661,Sovereigns are the largest issuers of government debt but non  sovereign sometimes  called sub  sovereign or local governments and the quasi  government entities that are  created by governments issue bonds as well  The non  sovereign or local governments  include governments of states  provinces  regions and cities   For example the City of  Tokyo  Tokyo Metropolitan Government  has debt outstanding  as does the Lombardy  region in Italy the City of Buenos Aires in Argentina  and the State of California in  the United States   Local government bonds may be referred to as municipal bonds    However when people talk about municipal bonds  they are usually referring  to US municipal bonds  which represent one of the largest bond markets   In  rd  quarter      the US municipal bond market was approximately      trillion in size  roughly    percent of the total US bond market     The US municipal bond market is  composed of both tax  exempt   and to a lesser extent  taxable bonds issued by state  and city governments and their agencies   Municipal borrowers may also issue bonds  on behalf of private entities  such as non  profit colleges or hospitals   Historically for  any given rating category these bonds have much lower default rates than corporate  bonds with the same ratings   For example according to Moody  s Investors Service  the     year average cumulative default rate from      through      was      percent  for municipal bonds  compared with an        percent     year average cumulative  default rate for all corporate debt      The majority of local government bonds  including municipal bonds  are either  general obligation bonds or revenue bonds   General obligation  GO  bonds are  unsecured bonds issued with the full faith and credit of the issuing non  sovereign  government  These bonds are supported by the taxing authority of the issuer  Revenue  bonds are issued for specific project financing  e g   financing for a new sewer system  a toll road bridge hospital a sports arena  etc    The credit analysis of GO bonds has some similarities to sovereign debt analysis   e g   the ability to levy and collect taxes and fees to help service debt  but also some  differences   For example almost without exception US municipalities must balance  their operating budgets  i e  exclusive of long  term capital projects  annually  Non   sovereign governments are unable to use monetary policy the way many sovereigns can   The economic analysis of non  sovereign government GO bonds  including US  municipal bonds  focuses on employment  per capita income  and changes in it over  time  per capita debt  and changes in it over time  the tax base  depth breadth  diversification stability etc   demographics  and net population growth as well as  an analysis of whether the area represented by the non  sovereign government has the  infrastructure and location to attract and support new jobs   Analysis should look at  the volatility and variability of revenues during times of both economic strength and  weakness   An overreliance on one or two types of tax revenue particularly a volatile

4,663,SUMMARY
5,663,In this reading  we introduced readers to the basic principles of credit analysis   We  described the importance of the credit markets and credit and credit  related risks   We  discussed the role and importance of credit ratings and the methodology associated  with assigning ratings  as well as the risks of relying on credit ratings   The reading  covered the key components of credit analysis and the financial measure used to help  assess creditworthiness   We also discussed risk versus return when investing in credit and how spread  changes affect holding period returns   In addition we addressed the special consid  erations to take into account when doing credit analysis of high  yield companies   sovereign borrowers  and non  sovereign government bonds      Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower failing to make full  and timely payments of interest and or principal     The key components of credit risk are risk of default and loss severity in the  event of default   The product of the two is expected loss   Investors in higher   quality bonds tend not to focus on loss severity because default risk for those  securities is low     Loss severity equals      Recovery rate      Credit  related risks include downgrade risk  also called credit migration risk   and market liquidity risk   Either of these can cause yield spreads yield premi  ums to rise and bond prices to fall     Downgrade risk refers to a decline in an issuer  s creditworthiness   Downgrades  will cause its bonds to trade with wider yield spreads and thus lower prices      Market liquidity risk refers to a widening of the bid ask spread on an issuer  s  bonds   Lower  quality bonds tend to have greater market liquidity risk than  higher  quality bonds  and during times of market or financial stress  market  liquidity risk rises      The composition of an issuer  s debt and equity is referred to as its  capital  structure   Debt ranks ahead of all types of equity with respect to priority of  payment  and within the debt component of the capital structure there can be  varying levels of seniority     With respect to priority of claims  secured debt ranks ahead of unsecured debt   and within unsecured debt  senior debt ranks ahead of subordinated debt   In  the typical case all of an issuer  s bonds have the same probability of default due  to cross  default provisions in most indentures   Higher priority of claim implies  higher recovery rate lower loss severity in the event of default      For issuers with more complex corporate structures for example a parent  holding company that has operating subsidiaries debt at the holding company  is structurally subordinated to the subsidiary debt  although the possibility of  more diverse assets and earnings streams from other sources could still result in  the parent having higher effective credit quality than a particular subsidiary

3,664,   Recovery rates can vary greatly by issuer and industry  They are influenced by  the composition of an issuer  s capital structure where in the economic and  credit cycle the default occurred and what the market s view of the future pros  pects are for the issuer and its industry     The priority of claims in bankruptcy is not always absolute  It can be influ  enced by several factors  including some leeway accorded to bankruptcy judges   government involvement  or a desire on the part of the more senior creditors  to settle with the more junior creditors and allow the issuer to emerge from  bankruptcy as a going concern rather than risking smaller and delayed recovery  in the event of a liquidation of the borrower     Credit rating agencies  such as Moody  s  Standard   Poor  s  and Fitch play a  central role in the credit markets   Nearly every bond issued in the broad debt  markets carries credit ratings  which are opinions about a bond issue s credit  worthiness   Credit ratings enable investors to compare the credit risk of debt  issues and issuers within a given industry across industries  and across geo  graphic markets      Bonds rated Aaa to Baa  by Moody  s and AAA to BBB  by Standard   Poor  s   S P  and or Fitch  higher to lower  are referred to as  investment grade    Bonds rated lower than that Ba  or lower by Moody  s and BB  or lower by  S P and or Fitch are referred to as  below investment grade  or  speculative  grade   Below  investment  grade bonds are also called  high  yield  or  junk   bonds      The rating agencies rate both issuers and issues   Issuer ratings are meant to  address an issuer  s overall creditworthiness its risk of default   Ratings for  issues incorporate such factors as their rankings in the capital structure     The rating agencies will notch issue ratings up or down to account for such fac  tors as capital structure ranking for secured or subordinated bonds  reflecting  different recovery rates in the event of default   Ratings may also be notched due  to structural subordination     There are risks in relying too much on credit agency ratings   Creditworthiness  may change over time and initial current ratings do not necessarily reflect  the creditworthiness of an issuer or bond over an investor  s holding period   Valuations often adjust before ratings change and the notching process may not  adequately reflect the price decline of a bond that is lower ranked in the capital  structure  Because ratings primarily reflect the probability of default but not  necessarily the severity of loss given default  bonds with the same rating may  have significantly different expected losses  default probability times loss sever  ity   And like analysts  credit rating agencies may have difficulty forecasting  certain credit  negative outcomes  such as adverse litigation leveraging corpo  rate transactions  and such low probability high severity events as earthquakes  and hurricanes      The role of corporate credit analysis is to assess the company  s ability to make  timely payments of interest and to repay principal at maturity      Credit analysis is similar to equity analysis   It is important to understand  however that bonds are contracts and that management s duty to bondholders  and other creditors is limited to the terms of the contract   In contrast  manage  ment s duty to shareholders is to act in their best interest by trying to maximize  the value of the company perhaps even at the expense of bondholders at  times      Credit analysts tend to focus more on the downside risk given the asymmetry  of risk return whereas equity analysts focus more on upside opportunity from  earnings growth and so on

3,665,   The    Cs  of credit capacity collateral covenants  and character provide a  useful framework for evaluating credit risk      Credit analysis focuses on an issuer  s ability to generate cash flow  The analysis  starts with an industry assessment structure and fundamentals and contin  ues with an analysis of an issuer  s competitive position management strategy  and track record     Credit measures are used to calculate an issuer  s creditworthiness  as well as  to compare its credit quality with peer companies   Key credit ratios focus on  leverage and interest coverage and use such measures as EBITDA  free cash  flow funds from operations  interest expense and balance sheet debt      An issuer  s ability to access liquidity is also an important consideration in credit  analysis      The higher the credit risk  the greater the offered required yield and potential  return demanded by investors   Over time bonds with more credit risk offer  higher returns but with greater volatility of return than bonds with lower credit  risk      The yield on a credit  risky bond comprises the yield on a default risk free bond  with a comparable maturity plus a yield premium or  spread  that comprises  a credit spread and a liquidity premium  That spread is intended to compen  sate investors for credit risk risk of default and loss severity in the event of  default and the credit  related risks that can cause spreads to widen and prices  to decline downgrade or credit migration risk and market liquidity risk   Yield spread   Liquidity premium   Credit spread     In times of financial market stress  the liquidity premium can increase sharply  causing spreads to widen on all credit  risky bonds  with lower  quality issu  ers most affected  In times of credit improvement or stability however credit  spreads can narrow sharply as well providing attractive investment returns      Credit curves the plot of yield spreads for a given bond issuer across the yield  curve are typically upward sloping  with the exception of high premium   priced bonds and distressed bonds  where credit curves can be inverted because  of the fear of default  when all creditors at a given ranking in the capital struc  ture will receive the same recovery rate without regard to debt maturity     The impact of spread changes on holding period returns for credit  risky bonds  are a product of two primary factors   the basis point spread change and the  sensitivity of price to yield as reflected by  end  of  period  modified duration  and convexity  Spread narrowing enhances holding period returns  whereas  spread widening has a negative impact on holding period returns   Longer   duration bonds have greater price and return sensitivity to changes in spread  than shorter  duration bonds   Price impact     MDur    Spread     Cvx     Spread      For high  yield bonds  with their greater risk of default  more emphasis should  be placed on an issuer  s sources of liquidity as well as on its debt structure and  corporate structure  Credit risk can vary greatly across an issuer  s debt structure  depending on the seniority ranking   Many high  yield companies have complex  capital structures  resulting in different levels of credit risk depending on where  the debt resides

4,677,  A is correct   Credit migration risk or downgrade risk refers to the risk that a  bond issuer  s creditworthiness may deteriorate or migrate lower  The result is  that investors view the risk of default to be higher causing the spread on the  issuer  s bonds to widen    C is correct   Market liquidity risk refers to the risk that the price at which inves  tors transact may be different from the price indicated in the market   Market  liquidity risk is increased by     less debt outstanding and or     a lower issue  credit rating   Because Stedsmart Ltd is comparable to Fignermo Ltd except for  less publicly traded debt outstanding  it should have higher market liquidity  risk     A is correct   First mortgage debt is senior secured debt and has the highest  priority of claims   First mortgage debt also has the highest expected recovery  rate  First mortgage debt refers to the pledge of specific property  Neither senior  unsecured nor junior subordinate debt has any claims on specific assets     B is correct   Whether or not secured assets are sufficient for the claims against  them does not influence priority of claims   Any deficiency between pledged  assets and the claims against them becomes senior unsecured debt and still  adheres to the guidelines of priority of claims     C is correct   Both analysts and ratings agencies have difficulty foreseeing future  debt  financed acquisitions     C is correct   Goodwill is viewed as a lower quality asset compared with tangible  assets that can be sold and more easily converted into cash    C is correct   The value of assets in relation to the level of debt is important to  assess the collateral of the company   that is  the quality and value of the assets  that support the debt levels of the company    B is correct   The growth prospects of the industry provide the analyst insight  regarding the capacity of the company    A is correct   The construction company is both highly leveraged which  increases credit risk  and in a highly cyclical industry which results in more  volatile earnings       B is correct   The interest expense is      million and EBITDA   Operating  profit   Depreciation and amortization              million         million   EBITDA interest coverage   EBITDA Interest expense                     times      B is correct   Total debt is       million with Total capital   Total debt    Shareholders  equity                        million  The Debt Capital ratio                           A is correct   If the debt of the company remained unchanged but FFO  increased more cash is available to service debt compared to the previous year   Additionally the debt capital ratio has improved  It would imply that the ability  of Pay Handle Ltd to service their debt has improved     A is correct   Based on four of the five credit ratios  Grupa Zywiec SA s credit  quality is superior to that of the industry     A is correct   Davide Campari  Milano S p A   has more financial leverage and  less interest coverage than Associated British Foods plc which implies greater  credit risk

3,678,   A is correct   Low demand implies wider yield spreads  while heavy supply will  widen spreads even further     C is correct   Credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the borrower failing to  make full and timely payments of interest and or principal      C is correct   Market liquidity risk is the risk that the price at which investors  can actually transact buying or selling may differ from the price indicated in  the market       C is correct   Loss severity is the portion of a bond s value  including unpaid  interest  an investor loses in the event of default       B is correct   The two components of credit risk are default probability and loss  severity  In the event of default  loss severity is the portion of a bond s value   including unpaid interest  an investor loses   A and C are incorrect because  spread and market liquidity risk are credit  related risks  not components of  credit risk       A is correct   Credit risk has two components   default risk and loss severity   Because default risk is quite low for most high  quality debt issuers  bond inves  tors tend to focus more on this likelihood and less on the potential loss severity     B is correct   The expected loss for a given debt instrument is the default prob  ability multiplied by the loss severity given default   The loss severity is often  expressed as      Recovery rate       A is correct   Senior subordinated debt is ranked lower than senior unsecured  debt and thus has a lower priority of payment      C is correct   The highest  ranked unsecured debt is senior unsecured debt    Lower  ranked debt includes senior subordinated debt   A and B are incorrect  because mortgage debt and second lien loans are secured and higher ranked     C is correct   According to the absolute priority of claims  in the event of bank  ruptcy creditors with a secured claim have the right to the value of that specific  property before any other claim     A is correct   A second lien has a secured interest in the pledged assets   Second  lien debt ranks higher in priority of payment than senior unsecured and senior  subordinated debt and thus would most likely have a higher recovery rate     A is correct   Notching is the process for moving ratings up or down relative to  the issuer rating when rating agencies consider secondary factors  such as prior  ity of claims in the event of a default and the potential loss severity     C is correct   Structural subordination can arise when a corporation with a  holding company structure has debt at both its parent holding company and  operating subsidiaries   Debt at the operating subsidiaries is serviced by the cash  flow and assets of the subsidiaries before funds are passed to the parent holding  company     C is correct   The issuer credit rating usually applies to its senior unsecured  debt      A is correct   Second lien debt is secured debt  which is senior to unsecured debt  and to subordinated debt       C is correct   An issuer credit rating usually applies to its senior unsecured debt       A is correct   Recognizing different payment priorities  and thus the potential for  higher  or lower  loss severity in the event of default  the rating agencies have  adopted a notching process whereby their credit ratings on issues can be moved  up or down from the issuer rating  senior unsecured

3,679,   C is correct   As a general rule the higher the senior unsecured rating  the  smaller the notching adjustment   Thus  for corporate bonds rated Aa  AA  the  rating agencies will typically apply smaller rating adjustments  or notches  to  the related issue      A is correct   Credit migration is the risk that a bond issuer  s creditworthiness  deteriorates  or migrates lower  Over time credit ratings can migrate signifi  cantly from what they were at the time a bond was issued  An investor should  not assume that an issuer  s credit rating will remain the same from the time of  purchase through the entire holding period      B is correct   An industry with a high number of suppliers reduces the suppliers   negotiating power thus helping companies control expenses and aiding in the  servicing of debt      A is correct   Credit analysis starts with industry structure for example by  looking at the major forces of competition followed by an analysis of industry  fundamentals and then turns to examination of the specific issuer     C is correct   Credit analysts can make judgments about management s character  by evaluating the use of aggressive accounting policies  such as timing reve  nue recognition  This activity is a potential warning flag for other behaviors or  actions that may adversely affect an issuer  s creditworthiness      B is correct   Capacity refers to the ability of a borrower to service its debt    Capacity is determined through credit analysis of an issuer  s industry and of the  specific issuer      A is correct   Credit analysts can make judgments about management s charac  ter in a number of ways  including by observing its use of aggressive accounting  policies and or tax strategies   An example of this aggressiveness is recognizing  revenue prematurely      C is correct   The debt capital and debt EBITDA ratios are used to assess a com  pany  s leverage  Higher leverage ratios indicate more leverage and thus higher  credit risk   Company C  s debt capital         and debt EBITDA        leverage  ratios are higher than those for Companies A and B     B is correct   The EBITDA interest expense and EBIT interest expense ratios are  coverage ratios   Coverage ratios measure an issuer  s ability to meet its interest  payments   A higher ratio indicates better credit quality  Company B s EBITDA  interest expense         and EBIT interest expense         coverage ratios are  higher than those for Companies A and C      C is correct because Company Y has a higher ratio of free cash flow after divi  dends to debt than Company X not lower as shown in the following table
