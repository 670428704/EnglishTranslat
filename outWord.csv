2,16,Imagine that you are employed in the research department of a large financial services firm   You and your colleagues spend your days researching analyzing and valuing the shares of  publicly traded companies and sharing your investment recommendations with clients  You  love your work and take great satisfaction in knowing that your recommendations can help the  firm s investing clients make informed investment decisions that will help them meet their  financial goals and improve their lives 
3,16,Several months after starting at the firm you learn that an analyst at the firm has been  terminated for writing and publishing research reports that misrepresented the fundamental risks  of some companies to investors  You learn that the analyst wrote the reports with the goal of  pleasing the management of the companies that were the subjects of the research reports  He  hoped that these companies would hire your firm s investment banking division for its services  and he would be rewarded with large bonuses for helping the firm increase its investment  banking fees  Some clients bought shares based on the analyst s reports and suffered losses   They posted stories on the internet about their losses and the misleading nature of the reports   When the media investigated and published the story the firm s reputation for investment  research suffered  Investors began to question the firm s motives and the objectivity of its  research recommendations  The firm s investment clients started to look elsewhere for  investment advice and company clients begin to transfer their business to firms with  untarnished reputations  With business declining management is forced to trim staff  Along  with many other hard working colleagues you lose your job through no fault of your own 
4,16,Imagine how you would feel in this situation  Most people would feel upset and resentful that  their hard and honest work was derailed by someone else s unethical behavior  Yet this type of  scenario is not uncommon  Around the world unsuspecting employees at such companies as  SAC Capital Stanford Financial Group Everbright Securities Enron Satyam Computer  Services Arthur Andersen and other large companies have experienced such career setbacks  when someone else s actions destroyed trust in their companies and industries 
5,16,Businesses and financial markets thrive on trust defined as a strong belief in the reliability of  a person or institution  In a      study on trust investors indicated that to earn their trust the  top three attributes of an investment manager should be that it     has transparent and open  business practices     takes responsible actions to address an issue or crisis and     has ethical  business practices   Although these attributes are valued by customers and clients in any industry this reading will explore why they are of particular importance to the investment  industry 
6,16,People may think that ethical behavior is simply about following laws regulations and other  rules but throughout our lives and careers we will encounter situations in which there is no  definitive rule that specifies how to act or the rules that exist may be unclear or even in conflict  with each other  Responsible people including investment professionals must be willing and  able to identify potential ethical issues and create solutions to them even in the absence of  clearly stated rules

2,17,   ETHICS
3,17,Through our individual actions each of us can affect the lives of others  Our decisions and  behavior can harm or benefit a variety of stakeholders individuals or groups of individuals  who could be affected either directly or indirectly by a decision and thus have an interest or  stake in the decision  Examples of stakeholders in decisions made by investment industry  professionals include our colleagues our clients our employers the communities in which we  live and work the investment profession and other financial market participants  In some cases  our actions may benefit all of these stakeholder groups  in other cases our actions may benefit  only some stakeholder groups  and in still other cases our actions may benefit some stakeholder  groups and harm others  For example recall the research analyst in the introduction who wrote  misleading research reports with the aim of increasing the financial benefit to himself and his  employer  In the very short term his conduct seemed to directly benefit some stakeholders   certain clients himself and his employer  and to harm other stakeholders  clients who invested  based on his reports   Over a longer time period his conduct resulted in harm to himself and  many other stakeholders his employer his employer s clients his colleagues investors and  through loss of trust when the story was published the larger financial market 
4,17,Ethics encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our  behavior  The word  ethics  comes from the Greek word  ethos  meaning character used to  describe the guiding beliefs or ideals characterizing a society or societal group  Beliefs are  assumptions or thoughts we hold to be true  A principle is defined as a belief or fundamental  truth that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or a chain of reasoning   Our beliefs form our values those things we deem to have worth or merit 
5,17,Moral principles or ethical principles are beliefs regarding what is good acceptable or  obligatory behavior and what is bad unacceptable or forbidden behavior  Ethical principles  may refer to beliefs regarding behavior that an individual expects of himself or herself as well  as shared beliefs regarding standards of behavior expected or required by a community or  societal group 
6,17,Another definition of ethics is the study of moral principles which can be described as the  study of good and bad behavior or the study of making good choices as opposed to bad choices   The study of ethics examines the role of consequences and personal character in defining what  is considered good or ethical conduct 
7,17,Ethical conduct is behavior that follows moral principles and balances self interest with both  the direct and the indirect consequences of the behavior on others  Ethical actions are those  actions that are perceived as beneficial and conforming to the ethical expectations of society   An action may be considered beneficial if it improves the outcomes or consequences for  stakeholders affected by the action  Telling the truth about the risks or costs associated with a  recommended investment for example is an ethical action that is one that conforms to the  ethical expectations of society in general and clients in particular  Telling the truth is also  beneficial  telling the truth builds trust with customers and clients and enables them to make  more informed decisions which should lead to better outcomes for them and higher levels of  client customer satisfaction for you and your employer

2,18,Widely acknowledged ethical principles include honesty fairness or justice diligence and  respect for the rights of others  Most societal groups share these fundamental ethical principles  and build on them establishing a shared set of rules regarding how members should behave in  certain situations  The principles or rules may take different forms depending on the community  establishing them 
3,18,Governments and related entities for example may establish laws and or regulations to reflect  widely shared beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct  Laws and regulations are rules of  conduct specified by a governing body such as a legislature or a regulator identifying how  individuals and entities under its jurisdiction should behave in certain situations  Most countries  have laws and regulations governing the investment industry and the conduct of its participants   Differences in laws may reflect differences in beliefs and values 
4,18,In some countries for example the law requires that an investment adviser act in the best  interests of his or her clients  Other countries require that investment professionals recommend  investments that are suitable for their clients  Investment advisers and portfolio managers who  are required by law to act in their clients  best interests must always put their clients  interests  ahead of their own or their employers  interests  An investment adviser who is required by law  to act in a client s best interest must understand the client s financial objectives and risk  tolerance research and investigate multiple investment opportunities and recommend the  investment or investment portfolio that is most suitable for the client in terms of meeting his or  her long term financial objectives  In addition the investment adviser would be expected to  monitor the client s financial situation and investments to ensure that the investments  recommended remain the best overall option for meeting the client s long term financial  objectives  In countries with only a suitability requirement it is legal for investment  professionals to recommend a suitable investment to a client even if other similar suitable  investments with lower fees are available  These differences in laws reflect differences in  beliefs and values 
5,18,Specific communities or societal groups in which we live and work sometimes codify their  beliefs about obligatory and forbidden conduct in a written set of principles often called a code  of ethics  Universities employers and professional associations often adopt a code of ethics to  communicate the organization s values and overall expectations regarding member behavior   The code of ethics serves as a general guide for how community members should act  Some  communities will also expand on their codes of ethics and adopt explicit rules or standards that  identify specific behaviors required of community members  These standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community members and can  help clarify the code of ethics  Members can choose behaviors that demonstrate even higher  standards  By joining the community members are agreeing to adhere to the community s code  of ethics and standards of conduct  To promote their code of ethics and reduce the incidence of  violations communities frequently display their codes in prominent locations and in written  materials  In addition most communities require that members commit to their codes in writing  on an annual or more frequent basis 
6,18,Violations of a community s established code of ethics and or standards of conduct can harm  the community in a variety of ways  Violations have the potential to damage the community s  reputation among external stakeholders and the general public  Violations can also damage the  community s reputation internally and lead to reduced trust among community members and  can cause the organization to fracture or splinter from within  To protect the reputation of its  membership and limit potential harm to innocent members the community may take corrective  actions to investigate possible violations repair any damages and attempt to discipline the  violator or in severe cases revoke the violator s membership in the community

2,19,CFA Institute is an example of a community with an established code of ethics and standards of  conduct  Its members and candidates commit to adhere to shared beliefs about acceptable  conduct for individuals participating in the investment industry  These beliefs are presented in  the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct  Code and Standards  which are  included in the CFA Institute Standards of Practice Handbook  The Code of Ethics  communicates the organization s principles values and expectations  For example the Code  states that members and candidates  place the integrity of the investment profession and the  interests of clients above their own personal interests   The Standards of Professional Conduct  outline minimally acceptable behaviors expected of all CFA Institute members and candidates   For example one standard requires that  Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of  their clients and place their clients  interests before their employer s or their own interests    Another standard requires that  Members and Candidates must make full and fair disclosure of  all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or  interfere with respective duties to their clients prospective clients and employer  Members and  Candidates must ensure that such disclosures are prominent are delivered in plain language  and communicate the relevant information effectively  
3,19,CFA Institute members and candidates re affirm their commitment to adhere to the Code and  Standards each year  In addition to protect the reputation of the community members and  candidates agree to submit a Professional Conduct Statement each year disclosing conduct that  may have violated the Code and Standards  To protect members and candidates CFA Institute  has an established disciplinary process  Members and candidates who violate the Code and  Standards are subject to disciplinary action

2,20,Solution to   
3,20,C is correct  Standards of conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable  behavior required of members of a group  Some organizations will adopt only a code of  ethics which communicates the organization s values and overall expectations  regarding member behavior  Others may adopt both a code of ethics and standards of  conduct  Standards of conduct identify specific behavior required of community  members and serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community  members 
4,20,   ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM
5,20,As you progress in your career you may find that attitudes among your peers vary  Some of  your peers may be happy to have a job others may consider themselves fortunate to find a  vocation and some may consider themselves part of a profession  What are the differences  A  job is very simply the work someone does to earn a living  A vocation is a job or occupation to  which someone is particularly well suited and is very dedicated  Often people will refer to a  vocation as a calling  They work in service of a cause they consider worthy  A profession is the  ultimate evolution of an occupation resulting from the efforts of members practicing the  occupation at a high level and creating a set of ethics and standards of conduct for the entire  group  A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from ordinary occupations  A  profession is
6,20,   based on specialized knowledge and skills 
7,20,   based on service to others 
8,20,   practiced by members who share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics 
9,20,Professionals use their specialized knowledge and skills to serve their clients with whom they  have a special relationship and to whom they have a special duty  Clients differ from customers   A customer purchases goods or services in a single transaction or series of transactions and pays  for each transaction or series of transactions  A client in contrast enters into an ongoing  relationship with a professional hiring the professional to use his or her special knowledge for  the benefit of the client usually for a fee  The relationship between client and professional is  based on trust rather than transactions  In exchange for the agreed on fee the professional  accepts the duty to place the client s interests first at all times 
10,20,In any given profession the code of ethics communicates the shared principles and expected  behaviors of its members  In addition to providing members with guidance for decision making  a code of ethics may generate confidence among not only members of the profession but also  individuals who are not members of the profession such as clients prospective clients and or  the general public  The code of ethics informs and provides some assurance to the public that  the profession s members will use their specialized skills and knowledge in service of others

2,21,Some codes will be enhanced and clarified by the adoption of standards of conduct or specific  benchmarks of behavior required of members  These standards may be principle based or rule  based  The CFA Institute Code and Standards are an example of principle based standards  they  are based on the shared principles of honesty integrity transparency diligence and placing  client interests first  Rule based standards are often narrowly defined applying to specific  groups of individuals in specific circumstances  Principle based standards such as those of  CFA Institute apply to all candidates and members at all times regardless of title position  occupation geographic location or specific situation 
3,21,As a CFA Program candidate you are expected to act in accordance with the ethical and  professional competency responsibilities of the investment profession as expressed in the Code  and Standards  The Code and Standards are designed to foster and reinforce a culture of  responsibility and professionalism  The Code and Standards apply to all your professional  activities including but not limited to trading securities for yourself and or others providing  investment advice conducting research and performing other investment services

2,22,Solution to   
3,22,C is correct  A profession s code of ethics publicly communicates the shared principles  and expected behaviors of a profession s members  The existence of a code of ethics  does not ensure that all members will behave in a manner consistent with the code and  act ethically at all times  A profession will often establish a disciplinary process to  address alleged violations of the code of ethics  A profession may adopt standards of  conduct to enhance and clarify the code of ethics 
4,22,   CHALLENGES TO ETHICAL CONDUCT
5,22,Professionals generally aim to be responsible and to adhere to high moral standards so what is  the benefit of studying ethics  Throughout our careers we may find ourselves in difficult or at  least unfamiliar situations in which an appropriate course of action is not immediately clear  and or there may be more than one seemingly acceptable choice  studying ethics helps us  prepare for such situations  This section addresses challenges to engaging in ethical conduct   Failure to acknowledge understand or consider these challenges can lead to poor decision  making resulting in unintentional consequences such as unethical conduct and potential  violations of the Code and Standards 
6,22,Several challenges can make adherence to ethical conduct difficult  First people tend to believe  that they are ethical people and that their ethical standards are higher than average  Of course  everyone cannot be above average  However surveys show this belief in above averageness  remains  As reported in A Crisis of Culture        for example     of surveyed financial  services executives rated their firm s reputation for ethical conduct better than the rest of the  industry   Among those surveyed     rated the industry s reputation for ethical conduct as  positive  In contrast a survey of global consumer sentiment conducted the same year revealed  that only     of consumers surveyed trusted financial service providers to do the right thing   In fact financial services was the least trusted of all industries included in the survey 
7,22,These survey results illustrate overconfidence a common behavioral bias that can lead to faulty  decision making  Studies have shown that our beliefs and emotions frequently interfere with our  cognitive reasoning and result in behavioral bias a tendency to behave in a way that is not  strictly rational   As a result of the overconfidence bias we are more likely to overestimate the  morality of our own behavior particularly in situations that we have not faced before  The  overconfidence bias can result in a failure to consider explicitly or implicitly important inputs  and variables needed to form the best decision from an ethical perspective  In general the  overconfidence bias leads us to place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic  motivations such as  I m honest and would not lie  even though studies have shown that  internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave  ethically in a given situation

2,23,A second challenge is that decision makers often fail to recognize and or significantly  underestimate the effect of situational influences such as what other people around them are  doing  Situational influences are external factors such as environmental or cultural elements  that shape our thinking decision making and behavior  Social psychologists have studied how  much situational influences affect our behavior and have found that even good people with  honorable motives can and often will be influenced to do unethical things when put into  difficult situations   Experiments have shown that even people who consider themselves strong  independent free thinkers will conform to social pressures in many situations   The bystander  effect for example demonstrates that people are less likely to intervene in an emergency when  others are present  Fortunately experiments have also shown that situational influences can  induce people to act more ethically  For example people tend to behave more ethically when  they think someone else is watching or when there is a mirror placed close to them   The  important concept to understand is that situational influences have a very powerful and often  unrecognized effect on our thinking and behavior  Thus learning to recognize situational  influences is critical to making good decisions 
3,23,Common situational influences in the investment industry that can shape thinking and behavior  include money and prestige  One experiment found that simply mentioning money can reduce  ethical behavior  In the experiment participants were less likely to cooperate when playing a  game if the game was called the Wall Street Game rather than the Community Game   In the  investment industry large financial rewards including individual salaries bonuses and or  investment gains can induce honest and well intentioned individuals to act in ways that others  might not consider ethical  Large financial rewards and or prestige can motivate individuals to  act in their own short term self interests ignoring possible short term risks or consequences to  themselves and others as well as long term risks or consequences for both themselves and  others  Another extremely powerful situational influence is loyalty  Loyalty to supervisors or  organizations fellow employees and other colleagues can tempt individuals to make  compromises and take actions that they would reject under different situational influences or  judge harshly when taken by others 
4,23,Situational influences often blind people to other important considerations  Bonuses  promotions prestige and loyalty to employer and colleagues are examples of situational  influences that frequently have a disproportionate weight in our decision making  Our brains  more easily and quickly identify recognize and consider these short term situational influences  than longer term considerations such as a commitment to maintaining our integrity and  contributing to the integrity of the financial markets  Although absolutely important these long  term considerations often have less immediate consequences than situational influences making  them less obvious as factors to consider in a decision and therefore less likely to influence our  overall decision making  Situational influences shift our brain s focus from the long term to the  short or immediate term  When our decision making is too narrowly focused on short term  factors and or self interest we tend to ignore and or minimize the longer term risks and or costs  and consequences to ourselves and others and the likelihood of suffering ethical lapses and  making poor decisions increases

2,24,The story of Enron Corporation a US energy company illustrates the power of situational  influences  In the late     s with approximately       employees the company s culture  focused on increasing current revenues and the share price without regard for the long term  sustainability or consequences of such a culture  Management received significant stock  options which provided strong motivation to make decisions and take actions that would  increase the share price  The focus on share price was inescapable  employees were greeted by  the stock ticker in lobbies and elevators and on their computer screens  The focus on share price  overshadowed considerations about stakeholders and the long term sustainability of the  business and its profits  Under these situational influences some senior managers made poor  decisions and eventually succumbed to unethical conduct  They devised and adopted complex  accounting strategies that inflated revenues obscured the company s financial performance and  hid billions of dollars in debt  In October      the financial press revealed what Enron s  accounting practices had previously concealed  Shares of Enron which had reached a high of  US       in mid      fell to less than US   by the end of November       The company  which had claimed revenues of nearly US     billion in      secured a place in the record  books as one of the largest bankruptcies in US history  Dozens of former executives and  employees were investigated and many were charged with fraud and or conspiracy  Sixteen  individuals pled guilty including Chief Financial Officer  CFO  Andrew S  Fastow who pled  guilty to conspiracy forfeited nearly US    million in cash and property and was sentenced to  six years in prison  After a lengthy investigation and trial former Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey K  Skilling was convicted in May      of fraud conspiracy insider trading and making  false statements  He was sentenced to more than    years in prison a sentence that was  eventually reduced to    years   
3,24,Loyalty to employer and or colleagues is an extremely powerful situational influence  Our  colleagues can influence our thinking and behavior in both positive and negative ways  For  example colleagues may have encouraged you to signal your commitment to your career and  high ethical standards by enrolling in the CFA Program  If you work for or with people who are  not bound by the Code and Standards they might encourage you to take actions that are  consistent with local law unaware that the recommended conduct falls short of the Code and  Standards

2,25,Well intentioned firms may adopt or develop strong compliance programs to encourage  adherence to rules regulations and policies  A strong compliance policy is a good start to  developing an ethical culture but a focus on adherence to rules may not be sufficient  A  compliance approach may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture and can  oversimplify decision making  Taken to the extreme a strong compliance culture can become  another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations  In a firm  focused primarily on compliance employees may adopt a  check the box  mentality rather than  an ethical decision making approach  Employees may ask the question  What can I do   rather  than  What should I do   At Enron for example in compliance with procedures CFO Fastow  dutifully disclosed that he was the owner of several partnerships planning to transact business  with Enron  With powerful situational influences at work Fastow and board members focused  on  What can I do   rather than  What should I do   Compliance required that Fastow make  the ownership disclosures and request approval for the proposed business transactions from  Enron s board of directors which he did  Board members seemed to focus on the compliance  requirements to provide board approval of the proposed transactions rather than considering  their obligations to shareholders  In so doing they neglected to view the issue from a broader  perspective and consider  What should we do   Consequently they failed to recognize that the  proposed transactions placed Fastow s interests in direct conflict with those of his employer and  its shareholders  By focusing on the compliance requirements to provide board approval board  members failed to prevent Fastow from engaging in activity that enriched himself at the  expense of his employer and its shareholders  The Enron case illustrates both the power of  situational influences and the limitations of a compliance approach which can contribute to  overconfidence and is insufficient for ensuring ethical decision making

2,26,Solution to   
3,26,C is correct  Social psychologists have shown that even good people may behave  unethically in difficult situations  Situational influences which are external factors  e g   environmental or cultural elements  can shape our thinking decision making and  behavior and are more likely to lead to unethical behavior than internal traits or  character 
4,26,Solution to   
5,26,C is correct  Situational influences can motivate individuals to act in their short term  self interests without recognizing the long term risks or consequences for themselves  and others  Large financial rewards are powerful situational influences but in some  situations other situational influences such as loyalty to colleagues may be even more  powerful 
6,26,   THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT IN  THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY
7,26,Why are high ethical standards so important for the investment industry and investment  professionals  As the global financial crisis of      demonstrated isolated and seemingly  unimportant individual decisions such as approving loans to individuals unable to provide  proof of stable income in aggregate can precipitate a market crisis that can lead to economic  difficulties and job losses for millions of individuals  In an interconnected global economy and  marketplace each market participant must strive to understand how his or her decisions and  actions and the products and services he or she provides may affect others not just in the short  term but also the long term 
8,26,The investment industry serves society by matching those who supply capital or money with  those who seek capital to finance or fund their activities  For simplicity let us refer to those  who supply capital as investors and those who seek capital as borrowers  Borrowers may seek  capital to achieve long term goals such as building or upgrading factories schools bridges  highways airports railroads or other facilities  They may also seek short term capital to fund  short term goals and or support their daily operations  Borrowers seeking capital to meet short   and long term objectives include sovereign entities businesses schools hospitals companies  and other organizations that serve others  Some borrowers will turn to banks or other lending  institutions to finance their activities  others will turn to the financial markets to access the  funds they need to achieve their goals

2,27,In exchange for supplying capital to fund the borrowers  endeavors investors expect that their  investments will generate returns that compensate them for the use of their funds and the risks  involved  Before providing capital diligent and disciplined investors will evaluate the risks and  rewards of providing the capital  Some risks such as a downturn in the economy or a new  competitor could adversely affect the returns expected from the investment  To help evaluate  the potential risks and rewards of the investment investors conduct research reading and  evaluating the borrower s financial statements management s business plan research reports  industry reports and competitive analyses  Responsible investors will not invest their capital  unless they trust that their capital will be used in the way that has been described and is likely to  generate the returns they desire  Investors and society benefit when capital flows to borrowers  that can create the most value from the capital through their products and services 
3,27,Capital flows more efficiently between investors and borrowers when financial market  participants are confident that all parties will behave ethically  Ethical behavior builds and  fosters trust which has benefits for individuals firms the financial markets and society  When  people believe that a person or institution is reliable and acts in accordance with their  expectations they are more willing to take risks involving those people and institutions  For  example when people trust their financial advisers institutions and the financial markets they  are more likely to invest their money and accept the risk of short term price fluctuations  because they can reasonably believe that their investments will provide them with long term  benefits  Entrepreneurs are more likely to accept the risk of expanding their businesses and  hiring additional employees if they believe they will be able to attract investors with the funds  needed to expand at a reasonable cost  The higher the level of trust in the financial system the  more people are willing to participate in the financial markets  Broad participation in the  financial markets enables the flow of capital to fund the growth in goods services and  infrastructure that benefits society with new and often better hospitals bridges products  services and jobs  Broad participation in the financial markets also means that the need and  demand for investment professionals increase resulting in more job opportunities for those  seeking to use their specialized skills and knowledge of the financial markets in service to  others 
4,27,Ethics always matter but ethics are of particular importance in the investment industry because  the investment industry and financial markets are built on trust  Trust is important to all  business yet it is especially important in the investment industry for several reasons including  the nature of the client relationship differences in knowledge and access to information and the  nature of investment products and services 
5,27,In the client relationship investors entrust their assets to financial firms for care and  safekeeping  By doing so clients charge the firm and its employees with a special  responsibility  they are putting their faith and trust in the firm and its employees to protect their  assets  If the firm and its employees fail to protect clients  assets it could have severe  consequences for those clients  Without trust in that protection the firm and its employees  would not have any business 
6,27,Those who work in the investment industry as well as those who work in other professions  have specialized knowledge and sometimes better access to information  Having specialized  knowledge and better access to information is an advantage in any relationship giving one  party more power than the other  Investors trust that the professionals they hire will not use  their knowledge to take advantage of them  They rely on the investment professional to use his  or her specialized knowledge to serve or benefit their clients  interests

2,28,Another reason why trust is so important in the investment industry has to do with the nature of  its products and services  In other industries such as the transportation industry the  technology industry the retail industry or the food industry companies produce products  and or provide services that are tangible and or clearly visible  We can hold an electronic tablet  in our hands and inspect it  We can use software programs shop at retailers dine at restaurant  chains and watch films  We can judge the quality of the product or service based on a variety of  factors  How well does it perform its intended function  How efficient is it  How durable is it   How appealing is it  Is the price reasonable or appropriate for the product or service 
3,28,In the investment industry many investments are intangible and appear only as numbers on a  page or a screen  Investors cannot hold inspect or test their intended purchases as they can a  smartphone or a television set each of which often come with warranties should they fail to  function as advertised  Without tangible products to inspect and with no warranties for  protection should the product or service fail to perform as expected investors must rely on the  information provided about the investment both before and after purchase  When they call  their financial adviser and ask to see their investments they receive either an electronic or  printed statement with a list of holdings  They trust that the information is accurate and  complete a fair representation just as they trust that the investment professionals with whom  they are dealing will protect their interests  The globalization of finance also means that  investment professionals are likely to have business opportunities in new or unfamiliar places   Without trust financial transactions including global transactions are less likely to occur 
4,28,Because of these factors trust is the very foundation of the financial markets  This trust is built  fostered and maintained by the ethical actions of all the individuals who work and or  participate in the markets including those who work for companies banks investment firms  sovereign entities rating agencies accounting firms financial advisers and planners and  institutional and retail investors  When market participants act ethically investors and others  can trust that the numbers on the screen or the page are accurate representations and be  confident that investing and participating in the financial markets is worthwhile 
5,28,Ethical behavior by all market participants can lead to broader participation in the markets  protection of clients  interests and more opportunities for investment professionals and their  firms  Ethical behavior by firms can lead to higher levels of success and profitability for the  firms as well as their employees  Clients are attracted to firms with trustworthy reputations  leading to more business higher revenues and more profits  Ethical firms may also enjoy lower  relative costs than unethical firms because regulators are less likely to have cause to initiate  costly investigations or impose significant fines on firms in which high ethical standards are the  norm 
6,28,Conversely unethical behavior erodes and can even destroy trust  When clients and investors  suspect that they are not receiving accurate information or that the market is not a level playing  field they lose trust  Investors with low trust are less willing to accept risks  They may demand  a higher return for the use of their capital choose to invest elsewhere or choose not to invest at  all  Any of these actions would increase costs for borrowers seeking capital to finance their  activities  Without access to capital borrowers may not be able to meet their goals of building  new factories bridges or hospitals  Decreases in investments can harm society by reducing  jobs growth and innovation  Unethical behavior ultimately harms not only clients but also the  firm its employees and others

2,29,Diminished trust in financial markets can reduce growth in the investment industry and tarnish  the reputation of firms and individuals in the industry even if they did not participate in the  unethical behavior  Unethical behavior interferes with the ability of markets to channel capital  to the borrowers that can create the most value from the capital contributing to economic  growth  Both markets and society suffer when unethical behavior destroys trust in financial  markets  For you personally unethical behavior can cost you your job reputation and  professional stature and can lead to monetary penalties and possibly time in jail

4,29,The Importance of Ethical Conduct in the  Investment Industry
5,29,Which of the following statements is most accurate  Investment professionals have a  special responsibility to act ethically because 
6,29,A  the industry is heavily regulated 
7,29,B  they are entrusted to protect clients  assets 
8,29,C  the profession requires compliance with its code of ethics 
9,29,Solution 
10,29,B is correct  Investment professionals have a special responsibility because clients  entrust them to protect the clients  assets 
11,29,   ETHICAL VS  LEGAL STANDARDS
12,29,Many times stakeholders have common ethical expectations  Other times different  stakeholders will have different perceptions and perspectives and use different criteria to decide  whether something is beneficial and or ethical

2,30,Laws and regulations often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for society or  specific groups of stakeholders  For example some laws and regulations require businesses and  their representatives to tell the truth  They require specific written disclosures in marketing and  other materials  Complying with such rules is considered an ethical action  it creates a more  satisfactory outcome that conforms to stakeholders  ethical expectations  As an example  consider disclosure requirements mandated by securities regulators regarding the risks of  investing  Complying with such rules creates better outcomes for you your clients and your  employer  First compliance with the rule reduces the risk that clients will invest in securities  without understanding the risks involved which in turn reduces the risk that clients will file  complaints and or take legal action if their investments decline in value  Complying with the  rules also reduces the risk that regulators will initiate an investigation file charges or and  discipline or sanction you and or your employer  Any of these actions could jeopardize the  reputation and future prospects of you and your employer  Conduct that reduces these risks   e g  following disclosure rules  would be considered ethical  it leads to better outcomes for  you your clients and your employer and conforms to the ethical expectations of various  stakeholders 
3,30,Although laws frequently codify ethical actions legal and ethical conduct are not always the  same  Think about the diagram in Exhibit    Many types of conduct are both legal and ethical  but some conduct may be one and not the other  Some legal behaviors or activities may be  considered unethical and some behaviors or activities considered ethical may be deemed illegal  in certain jurisdictions  Acts of civil disobedience such as peaceful protests may be in response  to laws that individuals consider unethical  The act of civil disobedience may itself be  considered ethical and yet it violates existing local laws 
4,30,The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but considered by some to  be unethical  Some countries for example do not have laws prohibiting trading while in  possession of material nonpublic information but many investment professionals and CFA  Institute consider such trading unethical 
5,30,Another area in which ethics and laws may conflict is the area of  whistleblowing    Whistleblowing refers to the disclosure by an individual of dishonest corrupt or illegal activity  by an organization or government  Depending on the circumstances a whistleblower may  violate organizational policies and even local laws with the disclosure  thus a whistleblower s  actions may be deemed illegal and yet considered by some to be ethical

2,31,Exhibit    Types of Conduct
3,31,Some people advocate that increased regulation and monitoring of the behavior of participants  in the investment industry will increase trust in the financial markets  Although this approach  may work in some circumstances the law is not always the best mechanism to reduce unethical  behavior for several reasons  First laws typically follow market practices  regulators may  proactively design laws and regulations to address existing or anticipated practices that may  adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of markets or reactively design laws and regulations  in response to a crisis or an event that resulted in significant monetary losses and loss of  confidence trust in the financial system  Regulators  responses typically take significant time  during which the problematic practice may continue or even grow  Once enacted a new law  may be vague conflicting and or too narrow in scope  A new law may reduce or even eliminate  the existing activity while simultaneously creating an opportunity for a different but similarly  problematic activity  Additionally laws vary across countries or jurisdictions allowing  questionable practices to move to places that lack laws relevant to the questionable practice   Laws are also subject to interpretation and compliance by market participants who may choose  to interpret the law in the most advantageous way possible or delay compliance until a later  date  For these reasons laws and regulations are insufficient to ensure the ethical behavior of  investment professionals and market participants 
4,31,Ethical conduct goes beyond what is legally required and encompasses what different societal  groups or communities including professional associations consider to be ethically correct  behavior  To act ethically individuals need to be able to think through the facts of the situation  and make good choices even in the absence of clear laws or rules  In many cases there is no  simple algorithm or formula that will always lead to an ethical course of action  Ethics requires  judgment the ability to make considered decisions and reach sensible conclusions  Good  ethical judgment requires actively considering the interests of stakeholders and trying to benefit  multiple stakeholders clients family colleagues employers market participants and so  forth and minimize risks including reputational risk

7,32,C  Legal standards represent the highest standard 
8,32,   Which of the following statements is most accurate 
9,32,A  Increased regulations are the most useful means to reduce unethical  behavior by market participants 
10,32,B  Regulators quickly design and implement laws and regulations to address  practices that adversely affect the fairness and efficiency of markets 
11,32,C  New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the  markets can create opportunities for different but similarly problematic  conduct 
12,32,Solution to   
13,32,B is correct  Some ethical behavior may be illegal  Civil disobedience is an example of  what may be illegal behavior that some consider to be ethical  Legal and ethical  behavior often coincide but not always  Standards of conduct based on ethical principles  may represent a higher standard of behavior than the behavior required by law 
14,32,Solution to   
15,32,C is correct  New laws designed to reduce or eliminate conduct that adversely affects the  markets can create opportunities for different but similarly problematic conduct

2,33,   ETHICAL DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORKS
3,33,Laws regulations professional standards and codes of ethics can guide ethical behavior but  individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and engaging in  appropriate conduct  One strategy to increase trust in the investment industry is to increase the  ability and motivation of market participants to act ethically and help them minimize the  likelihood of unethical actions  By integrating ethics into the decision making activities of  employees firms can enhance the ability and the motivation of employees to act ethically  thereby reducing the likelihood of unethical actions  The ability to relate an ethical decision  making framework to a firm s or profession s code of ethics allows investment professionals to  bring the principles of the code of ethics to life  An investment professional s natural desire to   do the right thing  can be reinforced by building a culture of integrity in the workplace   Development maintenance and demonstration of a strong culture of integrity within the firm  by senior management may be the single most important factor in promoting ethical behavior  among the firm s employees 
4,33,Adopting a code that clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought processes and  conduct the firm expects from its employees is a critical first step  But a code of ethics  although necessary is insufficient  Simply nurturing an inclination to do right is no match for  the multitude of daily decisions that investment professionals make  We need to exercise ethical  decision making skills to develop the muscle memory necessary for fundamentally ethical  people to make good decisions despite the reality of conflicts and our natural instinct for self  preservation  Just as coaching and practice transform our natural ability to run across a field into  the technique and endurance required to run a race teaching reinforcing and practicing ethical  decision making skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively  It is good for business  individuals firms the industry and the markets as well as society as a whole to engage in the  investment management profession in a highly ethical manner  A strong ethical culture that  helps honest ethical people engage in ethical behavior will foster the trust of investors lead to  robust global financial markets and ultimately benefit society  That is why ethics matter 
5,33,When faced with decisions that can affect multiple stakeholders investment professionals must  have a well developed set of principles  otherwise their thought processes can lead to at best  indecision and at worst fraudulent conduct and destruction of the public trust  Establishing an  ethical framework to guide your internal thought process regarding how to act is a crucial step  to engaging in ethical conduct  Investment professionals are generally comfortable analyzing  and making decisions from an economic  profit loss  perspective  Given the importance of  ethical behavior in carrying out professional responsibilities it is also important to analyze  decisions and their potential consequences from an ethical perspective  Using a framework for  ethical decision making will help investment professionals to effectively examine their choices  in the context of conflicting interests common to their professional obligations  e g  researching  and gathering information developing investment recommendations and managing money for  others   Such a framework will allow investment professionals to analyze and choose options in  a way that allows them to meet high standards of ethical behavior  An ethical decision making  framework provides investment professionals with a tool to help them adhere to a code of  ethics  By applying the framework and analyzing the particular circumstances of each available  alternative investment professionals are able to determine the best course of action to fulfill  their responsibilities in an ethical manner

2,34,An ethical decision making framework will help a decision maker see the situation from  multiple perspectives and pay attention to aspects of the situation that may be less evident with  a short term self focused perspective  The goal of getting a broader picture of a situation is to  be able to create a plan of action that is less likely to harm stakeholders and more likely to  benefit them  If a decision maker does not know or understand the effects of his or her actions  on stakeholders the likelihood of making a decision and taking action that harms stakeholders  is more likely to occur even if unintentionally  Finally an ethical decision making framework  helps decision makers justify their actions to a broader audience of stakeholders 
3,34,Ethical decision making frameworks are designed to facilitate the decision making process for  all decisions  They help people look at and evaluate a decision from multiple perspectives  enabling them to identify important issues they might not otherwise consider  Using an ethical  decision making framework consistently will help you develop sound judgment and decision  making skills and avoid making decisions that have unanticipated ethical consequences  Ethical  decision making frameworks come in many forms with varying degrees of detail  A general  ethical decision making framework is shown in Exhibit   
4,34,Exhibit    Ethical Decision Making Framework
5,34,  Identify  Relevant facts stakeholders and duties owed ethical principles  conflicts of interest
6,34,  Consider  Situational influences additional guidance alternative actions
7,34,  Decide and act
8,34,  Reflect  Was the outcome as anticipated  Why or why not 
9,34,The ethical decision making process includes multiple phases each of which has multiple  components  The process is often iterative and you the decision maker may move between  phases in an order different from what is presented  For simplicity we will discuss the phases  sequentially  In the initial phase you will want to identify the important facts that you have  available to you as well as information that you may not have but would like to have to give  yourself a more complete understanding of the situation  You will also want to identify the  stakeholders clients family colleagues your employer market participants and so  forth and the duties you have to each of them  You will then want to identify relevant ethical  principles and or legal requirements that might apply to the situation  You should also identify  any potential conflicts of interest inherent in the situation or conflicts in the duties you hold to  others  For example your duty to your client may conflict with your duty to your employer

2,35,In the second phase of ethical decision making you will take time to consider the situational  influences as well as personal behavioral biases that could affect your thinking and thus  decision making  These situational influences and biases could include a desire to please your  boss to be seen as successful by your peers and family to gain acceptance to earn a large  bonus and so on  During this phase you may seek additional guidance from trusted  sources perhaps a family member colleague or mentor who can help you think through the  situation and help you identify and evaluate alternative actions  You may turn to your  compliance department for assistance or you may even consult outside legal counsel  Seeking  additional guidance is a critical step in viewing the situation from different perspectives  You  should seek guidance from someone who is not affected by the same situational influences and  behavioral biases as you are and can therefore provide a fresh perspective  You should also  seek guidance from your firm s policies and procedures and the CFA Institute Code and  Standards  A helpful technique might be to imagine how an ethical peer or role model might act  in the situation 
3,35,The next phase of the framework is to make a decision and act  After you have acted on your  decision you should take the time to reflect on and assess your decision and its outcome  Was  the outcome what you anticipated  Why or why not  Had you properly identified all the  important facts stakeholders duties to stakeholders conflicts of interest and relevant ethical  principles  Had you considered the situational influences  Did you identify personal behavioral  biases that might affect your thinking  Had you sought sufficient guidance  Had you  considered and properly evaluated a variety of alternative actions  You may want to reflect on  the decision multiple times as the immediate and longer term consequences of your decision  and actions become apparent 
4,35,The process is often iterative  After identifying the relevant facts and considering situational  influences you may for example decide that you cannot make a decision without more  information  You may seek additional guidance on how to obtain the information you need   You may also begin considering alternative actions regarding how to proceed based on  expectations of what the additional information will reveal or you may wait until you have  more information reflect on what you have done and learned so far and start the process over  again  Sometimes cases can be complicated and multiple iterations may reveal that no totally  acceptable solution can be created  Applying an ethical decision making framework can help  you evaluate the situation so you can make the best possible decision  The next section shows  applications of the framework shown in Exhibit

11,38,  The firm s written policies
12,38,  A peer in my firm
13,38,  My supervisor the senior analyst
14,38,  The compliance department
15,38,  A mentor either at the firm or perhaps from university
16,38,  The CFA Institute Code and Standards

19,38,  Submitting the report as a draft and suggesting that contacts in  the industry might be able to provide more perspective
20,38,  Sending a survey to various technology industry veterans  soliciting their viewpoints on developments
21,38,After completing these steps you decide to check the firm s policies  Under a section  entitled  Research Analyst Role in Securities Offerings  the manual states  You may  not distribute any written  which include email fax electronic and other means   material related to companies and or their offerings       during the course of any offering  and the related quiet period

2,39,You read further and note a section entitled  Wall Crossing Policy and Procedures  that  states that  employees with confidential information may not communicate the  information to anyone who does not have a valid need to know  without first obtaining  clearance from the legal and compliance department 
3,39,You decide that your contacts do not have a  valid need to know  and that it is unlikely  the firm s legal and compliance professionals would approve sharing the information   You then decide to mention your contacts to the senior research analyst  He suggests  that they may have some useful perspective and that you might talk to them to hear their  perspective and cautions you not to disclose any information about any of the firm s  clients pending deals or research  You return to your desk delete the email and  following the senior research analyst s advice call your contacts on the telephone to  discuss the technology sector its prospects and its challenges  During the calls you  take care not to reveal any details about Big Tech Company or its offering 
4,39,Whatever action you take you should take time afterward to reflect on the decision and  the outcome  Was the outcome as anticipated  Why or why not 
5,39,The initial facts presented in the example are based on the real life experience of a young junior  analyst working on a highly anticipated IPO  The junior analyst may or may not have used an  ethical decision making framework to evaluate his situation  Without seeking additional  guidance the junior analyst sent an email similar to the one in the example with an attachment  that included confidential proprietary information including the senior analyst s analysis and  forecasts  Months later long after the IPO offering the junior analyst s email was discovered  by his employer  When questioned he admitted that he had received training regarding the  firm s policies and that he did not discuss or seek approval from anyone before sending the  email  Two days later the firm terminated the junior analyst s employment and reported to  regulatory authorities that he had been terminated for distributing written materials by email  during a securities offering in violation of firm policies that prohibit the dissemination of any  written materials during the course of a securities offering and related periods  The junior  analyst s supervisor also lost his job for failing to properly supervise the analyst  Multiple  regulators investigated the matter and the firm was fined millions of dollars for failing to  supervise its employees properly  The information regarding the junior analyst s termination  was posted and remains available on the regulator s website for all to see  Future employers  conducting routine background checks will know that the analyst was terminated for violating  firm policies relating to a securities offering 
6,39,The example presented is similar to situations faced by many analysts  Using an ethical  decision making framework will help you evaluate situations from multiple perspectives avoid  poor decision making and avoid the consequences that can result from taking an ill conceived  course of action  Using an ethical decision making framework is no guarantee of a positive  outcome but may help you avoid making unethical decisions

4,40,The financial adviser has added only a few new investors to the firm s funds but his  teammates have been very successful in their efforts  The end of the quarter is one week  away and his team is competing closely with another team for the bonus  One of his  teammates informs the financial adviser that he really needs the bonus so his elderly  mother can receive medical treatment

2,42,Solution to   
3,42,B is correct  Using an ethical decision making framework the financial adviser would  identify the relevant facts stakeholders duties owed and potential conflicts  In this  scenario the financial adviser owes a duty to his client as well as his employer  His  client s interests take precedence over all other interests  The bonus and his colleague s  desire to help his mother are situational influences  To navigate this situation the  financial adviser should seek additional information  he should research the risk and  return parameters and fee structures of other investments that can provide steady income  before making a recommendation to his client 
4,42,   CONCLUSION
5,42,This reading introduced ideas and concepts that will help you understand the importance of  ethical behavior in the investment industry as well as the challenges to adhering to high ethical  standards  A code of ethics will communicate an organization s values and the expected  behavior of its members as well as provide guidance for decision making  A code of ethics may  be further enhanced and clarified by the adoption of standards of conduct  An ethical decision  making framework combined with a code of ethics may help investment professionals analyze  their decisions in a way that identifies potential conflicts and negative consequences 
6,42,Knowing the rules to apply in a particular situation although important may not be sufficient to  ensure ethical conduct if used alone  Responsible professionals in the investment industry must  be able both to recognize areas that are prone to ethical pitfalls and to identify and process those  circumstances and influences that can impair judgment and lead to ethical lapses 
7,42,SUMMARY
8,42,  Ethics refers to the study of making good choices  Ethics encompasses a set of moral  principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behavior 
9,42,  Situational influences are external factors that may shape our behavior 
10,42,  Challenges to ethical behavior include being overconfident in our own morality  underestimating the effect of situational influences and focusing on the immediate rather  than long term outcomes or consequences of a decision 
11,42,  In any given profession the code of ethics publicly communicates the established  principles and expected behavior of its members

2,43,  Members of a profession use specialized knowledge and skills to serve others  they share  and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics to serve others and advance the  profession 
3,43,  A code of ethics helps foster public confidence that members of the profession will use  their specialized skills and knowledge to serve their clients and others 
4,43,  High ethical standards always matter and are of particular importance in the investment  industry which is based almost entirely on trust  Clients trust investment professionals to  use their specialized skills and knowledge to serve clients and protect client assets  All  stakeholders gain long term benefits when investment professionals adhere to high ethical  standards 
5,43,  Rules and laws often codify ethical actions that lead to better outcomes for society or  specific groups of stakeholders 
6,43,  Organizations and individuals generally adhere to legal standards but legal standards are  often created to address past ethical failings and do not provide guidance for an evolving  and increasingly complex world 
7,43,  Legal standards are often rule based  Ethical conduct goes beyond legal standards  balancing self interest with the direct and indirect consequences of behavior on others 
8,43,  A framework for ethical decision making can help people look at and evaluate a decision  from different perspectives enabling them to identify important issues make wise  decisions and limit unintended consequences

3,44,A  Overconfidence
4,44,B  Loyalty to employer
5,44,C  Promise of money or prestige
6,44,   Situational influences in decision making will most likely be minimized if 
7,44,A  strong compliance programs are in place 
8,44,B  longer term consequences are considered 
9,44,C  individuals believe they are truthful and honest 
10,44,   Decision makers who use a compliance approach are most likely to 
11,44,A  avoid situational influences 
12,44,B  oversimplify decision making 
13,44,C  consider more factors than when using an ethical decision making approach 
14,44,   When unethical behavior erodes trust in an investment firm that firm is more likely to  experience 
15,44,A  lower revenues only 
16,44,B  higher expenses only 
17,44,C  lower revenues and higher expenses

20,44,B  Trading while in possession of material nonpublic information

2,45,   C is correct  Standards of conduct are applied to specific communities or societal groups  and identify specific behaviors required of community members  These standards of  conduct serve as benchmarks for the minimally acceptable behavior of community  members  Codes of ethics serve as a general guide for how community members should  act  they communicate the organization s values and overall expectations regarding  member behavior but they do not identify specific behaviors required of community  members  Laws and regulations are rules of conduct defined by governments and related  entities about obligatory and forbidden conduct broadly applicable for individuals and  entities under their jurisdiction 
3,45,   B is correct  A profession has several characteristics that distinguish it from an  occupation or vocation such as specialized knowledge and skills service to others and a  code of ethics shared by its members  A profession is the ultimate evolution of an  occupation resulting from excellence in practice and expected adherence to a code of  ethics and standards of practice 
4,45,   A is correct  An overconfidence bias can lead individuals to put too much importance on  internal traits and intrinsic motivations such as their own perceptions of personal  honesty that can lead to faulty decision making  Loyalty to an employer and promise of  money or prestige are situational influences that can lead to faulty decision making 
5,45,   B is correct  Consciously considering long term consequences will help offset situational  influences  We more easily recognize and consider short term situational influences than  longer term considerations because longer term considerations have fewer immediate  consequences than situational influences do  When decision making is too narrowly  focused on short term factors we tend to ignore longer term risks and consequences and  the likelihood of poor ethical decision making increases  A strong compliance policy is a  good first step toward developing an ethical culture  a focus on rules adherence may not  be sufficient  Emphasis on compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider  the larger picture and can oversimplify decision making  Taken to the extreme a strong  compliance culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to  other important considerations  An overconfidence bias can place too much importance  on internal traits and intrinsic motivations such as  I m honest and would not lie  even  though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the main determinant of  whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation 
6,45,   B is correct  A compliance approach can oversimplify decision making and may not  encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture  A strong compliance culture  may be a good start in developing an ethical culture but can become another situational  influence that may result in employees failing to consider other important factors 
7,45,   C is correct  Unethical behavior ultimately harms investment firms  Clients are not  attracted if they suspect unethical behavior leading to less business and lower revenues   Investment firms may also experience higher relative costs because regulators are more  likely to have cause to initiate costly investigations 
8,45,   B is correct  The investment industry has examples of conduct that may be legal but that  CFA Institute considers unethical  Trading while in possession of material nonpublic  information is not prohibited by law worldwide and can therefore be legal but CFA  Institute considers such trading unethical

2,46,   C is correct  Using an ethical decision making framework consistently will help you  develop sound judgment and decision making skills and avoid making decisions that  have unanticipated ethical consequences  The decision making process is often iterative  and the decision maker may move between phases of the framework  A decision maker  should consider more than confirmable facts and relationships  for example the decision  maker should consider situational influences and personal biases

11,47,PREFACE
12,47,The Standards of Practice Handbook  Handbook  provides guidance to the people who grapple  with real ethical dilemmas in the investment profession on a daily basis  the Handbook addresses the professional intersection where theory meets practice and where the concept of  ethical behavior crosses from the abstract to the concrete  The Handbook is intended for a  diverse and global audience  CFA Institute members navigating ambiguous ethical situations   supervisors and direct indirect reports determining the nature of their responsibilities to each  other to existing and potential clients and to the broader financial markets  and candidates  preparing for the Chartered Financial Analyst  CFA  examinations 
13,47,Recent events in the global financial markets have tested the ethical mettle of financial market  participants including CFA Institute members  The standards taught in the CFA Program and  by which CFA Institute members and candidates must abide represent timeless ethical  principles and professional conduct for all market conditions  Through adherence to these  standards which continue to serve as the model for ethical behavior in the investment  professional globally each market participant does his or her part to improve the integrity and  efficient operations of the financial markets

2,48,The Handbook provides guidance in understanding the interconnectedness of the aspirational  and practical principles and provisions of the Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional  Conduct  Code and Standards   The Code contains high level aspirational ethical principles that  drive members and candidates to create a positive and reputable investment profession  The  Standards contain practical ethical principles of conduct that members and candidates must  follow to achieve the broader industry expectations  However applying the principles  individually may not capture the complexity of ethical requirements related to the investment  industry  The Code and Standards should be viewed and interpreted as an interwoven tapestry  of ethical requirements  Through members  and candidates  adherence to these principles as a  whole the integrity of and trust in the capital markets are improved 
3,48,Evolution of the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards  of Professional Conduct
4,48,Generally changes to the Code and Standards over the years have been minor  CFA Institute  has revised the language of the Code and Standards and occasionally added a new standard to  address a prominent issue of the day  For instance in      CFA Institute added the standard  addressing performance presentation to the existing list of standards 
5,48,Major changes came in      with the ninth edition of the Handbook  CFA Institute adopted  new standards revised some existing standards and reorganized the standards  The revisions  were intended to clarify the requirements of the Code and Standards and effectively convey to  its global membership what constitutes  best practice  in a number of areas relating to the  investment profession 
6,48,The Code and Standards must be regularly reviewed and updated if they are to remain effective  and continue to represent the highest ethical standards in the global investment industry  CFA  Institute strongly believes that revisions of the Code and Standards are not undertaken for  cosmetic purposes but to add value by addressing legitimate concerns and improving  comprehension 
7,48,Changes to the Code and Standards have far reaching implications for the CFA Institute  membership the CFA Program and the investment industry as a whole  CFA Institute members  and candidates are required to adhere to the Code and Standards  In addition the Code and  Standards are increasingly being adopted in whole or in part by firms and regulatory  authorities  Their relevance goes well beyond CFA Institute members and candidates 
8,48,Standards of Practice Handbook
9,48,The periodic revisions of the Code and Standards have come in conjunction with updates of the  Standards of Practice Handbook  The Handbook is the fundamental element of the ethics  education effort of CFA Institute and the primary resource for guidance in interpreting and  implementing the Code and Standards  The Handbook seeks to educate members and  candidates on how to apply the Code and Standards to their professional lives and thereby  benefit their clients employers and the investing public in general  The Handbook explains the  purpose of the Code and Standards and how they apply in a variety of situations  The sections  discuss and amplify each standard and suggest procedures to prevent violations

2,49,Examples in the  Application of the Standard  sections are meant to illustrate how the standard  applies to hypothetical but factual situations  The names contained in the examples are fictional  and are not meant to refer to any actual person or entity  Unless otherwise stated  e g  one or  more people specifically identified  individuals in each example are CFA Institute members  and holders of the CFA designation  Because factual circumstances vary so widely and often  involve gray areas the explanatory material and examples are not intended to be all inclusive   Many examples set forth in the application sections involve standards that have legal  counterparts  members are strongly urged to discuss with their supervisors and legal and  compliance departments the content of the Code and Standards and the members  general  obligations under the Code and Standards 
3,49,CFA Institute recognizes that the presence of any set of ethical standards may create a false  sense of security unless the documents are fully understood enforced and made a meaningful  part of everyday professional activities  The Handbook is intended to provide a useful frame of  reference that suggests ethical professional behavior in the investment decision making process   This book cannot cover every contingency or circumstance however and it does not attempt to  do so  The development and interpretation of the Code and Standards are evolving processes   the Code and Standards will be subject to continuing refinement 
4,49,Summary of Changes in the Eleventh Edition
5,49,The comprehensive review of the Code and Standards in      resulted in principle  requirements that remain applicable today  The review carried out for the eleventh edition  focused on market practices that have evolved since the tenth edition  Along with updates to the  guidance and examples within the Handbook the eleventh edition includes an update to the  Code of Ethics that embraces the members  role of maintaining the social contract between the  industry and investors  Additionally there are three changes to the Standards of Professional  Conduct which recognize the importance of proper supervision clear communications with  clients and the expanding educational programs of CFA Institute 
6,49,Inclusion of Updated CFA Institute Mission
7,49,The CFA Institute Board of Governors approved an updated mission for the organization that is  included in the Preamble to the Code and Standards  The new mission conveys the  organization s conviction in the investment industry s role in the betterment of society at large 
8,49,Mission 
9,49,To lead the investment profession globally by promoting the highest standards of  ethics education and professional excellence for the ultimate benefit of society 
10,49,Updated Code of Ethics Principle
11,49,One of the bullets in the Code of Ethics was updated to reflect the role that the capital markets  have in the greater society  As members work to promote and maintain the integrity of the  markets their actions should also help maintain the social contract with investors

7,50,The standard for members and candidates with supervision or authority over others within their  firms was updated to bring about improvements in preventing illegal and unethical actions from  occurring  The prior version of Standard IV C  focused on the detection and prevention of  violations  The updated version stresses broader compliance expectations which include the  detection and prevention aspects of the original version

13,50,Given the constant development of new and exotic financial instruments and strategies the  standard regarding communicating with clients now includes an implicit requirement to discuss  the risks and limitations of recommendations being made to clients  The new principle and  related guidance take into account the fact that levels of disclosure will differ between products  and services  Members and candidates along with their firms must determine the specific  disclosures their clients should receive while ensuring appropriate transparency of the  individual firms  investment processes

2,51,Modification to Standard VII A 
3,51,Since this standard was developed CFA Institute has launched additional educational programs   The updated standard not only maintains the integrity of the CFA Program but also expands the  same ethical considerations when members or candidates participate in such programs as the  CIPM Program and the CFA Institute Investment Foundations certificate program  Whether  participating as a member assisting with the curriculum or an examination or as a sitting  candidate within a program we expect them to engage in these programs as they would  participate in the CFA Program

10,51,General Guidance and Example Revision
11,51,The guidance and examples were updated to reflect practices and scenarios applicable to  today s investment industry  Two concepts that appear frequently in the updates in this edition  relate to the increased use of social media for business communications and the use of and  reliance on the output of quantitative models  The use of social media platforms has increased  significantly since the publication of the tenth edition  And although financial modeling is not  new to the industry this update reflects upon actions that are viewed as possible contributing  factors to the financial crises of the past decade

2,52,CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program
3,52,All CFA Institute members and candidates enrolled in the CFA Program are required to comply  with the Code and Standards  The CFA Institute Board of Governors maintains oversight and  responsibility for the Professional Conduct Program  PCP  which in conjunction with the  Disciplinary Review Committee  DRC  is responsible for enforcement of the Code and  Standards  The DRC is a volunteer committee of CFA charterholders who serve on panels to  review conduct and partner with Professional Conduct staff to establish and review professional  conduct policies  The CFA Institute Bylaws and Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct   Rules of Procedure  form the basic structure for enforcing the Code and Standards  The  Professional Conduct division is also responsible for enforcing testing policies of other CFA  Institute education programs as well as the professional conduct of Certificate in Investment  Performance Measurement  CIPM  certificants 
4,52,Professional Conduct inquiries come from a number of sources  First members and candidates  must self disclose on the annual Professional Conduct Statement all matters that question their  professional conduct such as involvement in civil litigation or a criminal investigation or being  the subject of a written complaint  Second written complaints received by Professional Conduct  staff can bring about an investigation  Third CFA Institute staff may become aware of  questionable conduct by a member or candidate through the media regulatory notices or  another public source  Fourth candidate conduct is monitored by proctors who complete reports  on candidates suspected to have violated testing rules on exam day  Lastly CFA Institute may  also conduct analyses of scores and exam materials after the exam as well as monitor online  and social media to detect disclosure of confidential exam information

8,54,ETHICS AND THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY
9,54,Society ultimately benefits from efficient markets where capital can freely flow to the most  productive or innovative destination  Well functioning capital markets efficiently match those  needing capital with those seeking to invest their assets in revenue generating ventures  In order  for capital markets to be efficient investors must be able to trust that the markets are fair and  transparent and offer them the opportunity to be rewarded for the risk they choose to take   Laws regulations and enforcement play a vital role but are insufficient alone to guarantee fair  and transparent markets  The markets depend on an ethical foundation to guide participants   judgment and behavior  CFA Institute maintains and promotes the Code of Ethics and Standards  of Professional Conduct in order to create a culture of ethics for the ultimate benefit of society 
10,54,Why Ethics Matters
11,54,Ethics can be defined as a set of moral principles or rules of conduct that provide guidance for  our behavior when it affects others  Widely acknowledged fundamental ethical principles  include honesty fairness diligence and care and respect for others  Ethical conduct follows  those principles and balances self interest with both the direct and the indirect consequences of  that behavior for other people

2,55,Not only does unethical behavior by individuals have serious personal consequences ranging  from job loss and reputational damage to fines and even jail but unethical conduct from  market participants investment professionals and those who service investors can damage  investor trust and thereby impair the sustainability of the global capital markets as a whole   Unfortunately there seems to be an unending parade of stories bringing to light accounting  frauds and manipulations Ponzi schemes insider trading scandals and other misdeeds  Not  surprisingly this has led to erosion in public confidence in investment professionals  Empirical  evidence from numerous surveys documents the low standing in the eyes of the investing public  of banks and financial services firms the very institutions that are entrusted with the economic  well being and retirement security of society 
3,55,Governments and regulators have historically tried to combat misconduct in the industry  through regulatory reform with various levels of success  Global capital markets are highly  regulated to protect investors and other market participants  However compliance with  regulation alone is insufficient to fully earn investor trust  Individuals and firms must develop a   culture of integrity  that permeates all levels of operations and promotes the ethical principles  of stewardship of investor assets and working in the best interests of clients above and beyond  strict compliance with the law  A strong ethical culture that helps honest ethical people engage  in ethical behavior will foster the trust of investors lead to robust global capital markets and  ultimately benefit society  That is why ethics matters 
4,55,Ethics Society and the Capital Markets
5,55,CFA Institute recently added the concept  for the ultimate benefit of society  to its mission  The  premise is that we want to live in a socially politically and financially stable society that  fosters individual well being and welfare of the public  A key ingredient for this goal is global  capital markets that facilitate the efficient allocation of resources so that the available capital  finds its way to places where it most benefits that society  These investments are then used to  produce goods and services to fund innovation and jobs and to promote improvements in  standards of living  Indeed such a function serves the interests of the society  Efficient capital  markets in turn provide a host of benefits to those providing the investment capital  Investors  are provided the opportunity to transfer and transform risk because the capital markets serve as  an information exchange create investment products provide liquidity and limit transaction  costs 
6,55,However a well functioning and efficient capital market system is dependent on trust of the  participants  If investors believe that capital market participants investment professionals and  firms cannot be trusted with their financial assets or that the capital markets are unfair such  that only insiders can be successful they will be unlikely to invest or at the very least will  require a higher risk premium  Decreased investment capital can reduce innovation and job  creation and hurt the economy and society as a whole  Reduced trust in capital markets can also  result in a less vibrant if not smaller investment industry 
7,55,Ethics for a global investment industry should be universal and ultimately support trust and  integrity above acceptable local or regional customs and culture  Universal ethics for a global  industry strongly supports the efficiency values and mission of the industry as a whole   Different countries may be at different stages of development in establishing standards of  practice but the end goal must be to achieve rules regulations and standards that support and  promote fundamental ethical principles on a global basis

2,56,Capital Market Sustainability and the Actions of One
3,56,Individuals and firms also have to look at the indirect impacts of their actions on the broader  investment community  The increasingly interconnected nature of global finance brings to the  fore an added consideration of market sustainability that was perhaps less appreciated in years  past  In addition to committing to the highest levels of ethical behavior today s investment  professionals and their employers should consider the long term health of the market as a  whole 
4,56,As recent events have demonstrated apparently isolated and unrelated decisions however  innocuous when considered on an individual basis in aggregate can precipitate a market crisis   In an interconnected global economy and marketplace each participant should strive to be  aware of how his or her actions or the products he or she distributes may have an impact on  capital market participants in other regions or countries 
5,56,Investment professionals should consider how their investment decision making processes  affect the global financial markets in the broader context of how they apply their ethical and  professional obligations  Those in positions of authority have a special responsibility to  consider the broader context of market sustainability in their development and approval of  corporate policies particularly those involving risk management and product development  In  addition corporate compensation strategies should not encourage otherwise ethically sound  individuals to engage in unethical or questionable conduct for financial gain  Ethics  sustainability and properly functioning capital markets are components of the same concept of  protecting the best interests of all  To always place the interests of clients ahead of both  investment professionals  own interests and those of their employer remains a key ethos 
6,56,The Relationship between Ethics and Regulations
7,56,Some equate ethical behavior with legal behavior  If you are following the law you must be  acting appropriately  Ethical principles like laws and regulations prescribe appropriate  constraints on our natural tendency to pursue self interest that could harm the interests of  others  Laws and regulations often attempt to guide people toward ethical behavior but they do  not cover all unethical behavior  Ethical behavior is often distinguished from legal conduct by  describing legal behavior as what is required and ethical behavior as conduct that is morally  correct  Ethical principles go beyond that which is legally sufficient and encompass what is the  right thing to do 
8,56,Given many regulators  lack of sufficient resources to enforce well conceived rules and  regulations relying on a regulatory framework to lead the charge in establishing ethical  behavior has its challenges  Therefore reliance on compliance with laws and regulation alone is  insufficient to ensure ethical behavior of investment professionals or to create a truly ethical  culture in the industry 
9,56,The recent past has shown us that some individuals will succeed at circumventing the regulatory  rules for their personal gain  Only the application of strong ethical principles at both the  individual level and the firm level will limit abuses  Knowing the rules or regulations to apply  in a particular situation although important may not be sufficient to ensure ethical conduct   Individuals must be able both to recognize areas that are prone to ethical pitfalls and to identify  and process those circumstances and influences that can impair ethical judgment

2,57,Applying an Ethical Framework
3,57,Laws regulations professional standards and codes of ethics can guide ethical behavior but  individual judgment is a critical ingredient in making principled choices and engaging in  appropriate conduct  When faced with an ethical dilemma individuals must have a well  developed set of principles  otherwise their thought processes can lead to at best equivocation  and indecision and at worst fraudulent conduct and destruction of the public trust  Establishing  an ethical framework for an internal thought process prior to deciding to act is a crucial step in  engaging in ethical conduct 
4,57,Most investment professionals are used to making decisions from a business  profit loss   outlook  But given the importance of ethical behavior in carrying out professional  responsibilities it is critical to also analyze decisions and potential conduct from an ethical  perspective  Utilizing a framework for ethical decision making will help investment  professionals effectively examine their conduct in the context of conflicting interests common  to their professional obligations  e g  researching and gathering information developing  investment recommendations and managing money for others   Such a framework will allow  investment professionals to analyze their conduct in a way that meets high standards of ethical  behavior 
5,57,An ethical decision making framework can come in many forms but should provide investment  professionals with a tool for following the principles of the firm s code of ethics  Through  analyzing the particular circumstances of each decision investment professionals are able to  determine the best course of action to fulfill their responsibilities in an ethical manner 
6,57,Commitment to Ethics by Firms
7,57,A firm s code of ethics risks becoming a largely ignored dusty compilation if it is not truly  integrated into the fabric of the business  The ability to relate an ethical decision making  framework to a firm s code of ethics allows investment professionals to bring the aspirations  and principles of the code of ethics to life transforming it from a compliance exercise to  something that is at the heart of a firm s culture 
8,57,An investment professional s natural desire to  do the right thing  must be reinforced by  building a culture of integrity in the workplace  Development maintenance and demonstration  of a strong culture of integrity within the firm by senior management may be the single most  important factor in promoting ethical behavior among the firm s employees  Adopting a code  that clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought processes and conduct the firm  expects from its employees is a critical first step  But a code of ethics while necessary is  insufficient 
9,57,Simply nurturing an inclination to do right is no match for the multitude of daily decisions that  investment managers make  We need to exercise ethical decision making skills to develop the  muscle memory necessary for fundamentally ethical people to make good decisions despite the  reality of agent conflicts  Just as coaching and practice transform our natural ability to run  across a field into the technique and endurance required to run a race teaching reinforcing and  practicing ethical decision making skills prepare us to confront the hard issues effectively  It is  good for business individuals firms the industry and the markets as well as society as a  whole to engage in the investment management profession in a highly ethical manner

2,58,Ethical Commitment of CFA Institute
3,58,An important goal of CFA Institute is to ensure that the organization and its members and  candidates develop promote and follow the highest ethical standards in the investment  industry  The CFA Institute Code of Ethics  Code  and Standards of Professional Conduct   Standards  are the foundation supporting the organization s quest to uphold the industry s  highest standards of individual and corporate practice and to help serve the greater good  The  Code is a set of principles that define the overarching conduct CFA Institute expects from its  members and CFA Program candidates  The Code works in tandem with the Standards which  outline professional conduct that constitutes fair and ethical business practices 
4,58,For more than    years CFA Institute members and candidates have been required to abide by  the organization s Code and Standards  Periodically CFA Institute has revised and updated its  Code and Standards to ensure that they remain relevant to the changing nature of the investment  profession and representative of the highest standard of professional conduct  Within this  Handbook CFA Institute addresses ethical principles for the profession including individual  professionalism  responsibilities to capital markets clients and employers  ethics involved in  investment analysis recommendations and actions  and possible conflicts of interest  Although  the investment world has become a far more complex place since the first publication of the  Standard of Practice Handbook distinguishing right from wrong remains the paramount  principle of the Code and Standards 
5,58,New challenges will continually arise for members and candidates in applying the Code and  Standards because many decisions are not unambiguously right or wrong  The dilemma exists  because the choice between right and wrong is not always clear  Even well intentioned  investment professionals can find themselves in circumstances that may tempt them to cut  corners  Situational influences can overpower the best of intentions 
6,58,CFA Institute has made a significant commitment to providing members and candidates with  the resources to extend and deepen their understanding of how to appropriately apply the  principles of the Code and Standards  The product offerings from CFA Institute offer a wealth  of material  Through publications conferences webcasts and podcasts the ethical challenges  of investment professionals are brought to light  Archived issues of these items are available on  the CFA Institute website  www cfainstitute org  
7,58,By reviewing these resources and discussing with their peers market participants can further  enhance their abilities to apply an effective ethical decision making framework  In time this  should help restore some of the trust recently lost by investors 
8,58,Markets function to an important extent on trust  Recent events have shown the fragility of this  foundation and the devastating consequences that can ensue when it is fundamentally  questioned  Investment professionals should remain mindful of the long term health of financial  markets and incorporate this concern for the market s sustainability in their investment decision  making  CFA Institute and the Standards of Practice Council hope this edition of the Handbook will assist and guide investment professionals in meeting the ethical demands of the highly  interconnected global capital markets for the ultimate benefit of society

5,65,  Participation in or Association with Violations by Others
6,65,  Investment Products and Applicable Laws
7,65,Members and candidates must understand the applicable laws and regulations of the countries  and jurisdictions where they engage in professional activities  These activities may include but  are not limited to trading of securities or other financial instruments providing investment  advice conducting research or performing other investment services  On the basis of their  reasonable and good faith understanding members and candidates must comply with the laws  and regulations that directly govern their professional activities and resulting outcomes and that  protect the interests of the clients 
8,65,When questions arise members and candidates should know their firm s policies and  procedures for accessing compliance guidance  This standard does not require members and  candidates to become experts however in compliance  Additionally members and candidates  are not required to have detailed knowledge of or be experts on all the laws that could  potentially govern their activities 
9,65,During times of changing regulations members and candidates must remain vigilant in  maintaining their knowledge of the requirements for their professional activities  New financial  products and processes along with uncovered ethical missteps create an environment for  recurring and potentially wide ranging regulatory changes  Members and candidates are also  continually provided improved and enhanced methods of communicating with both clients and  potential clients such as mobile applications and web based social networking platforms  As  new local regional and global requirements are updated to address these and other changes  members candidates and their firms must adjust their procedures and practices to remain in  compliance 
10,65,Relationship between the Code and Standards and Applicable Law
11,65,Some members or candidates may live work or provide investment services to clients living in  a country that has no law or regulation governing a particular action or that has laws or  regulations that differ from the requirements of the Code and Standards  When applicable law  and the Code and Standards require different conduct members and candidates must follow the  more strict of the applicable law or the Code and Standards 
12,65, Applicable law  is the law that governs the member s or candidate s conduct  Which law  applies will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case  The  more strict   law or regulation is the law or regulation that imposes greater restrictions on the action of the  member or candidate or calls for the member or candidate to exert a greater degree of action  that protects the interests of investors  For example applicable law or regulation may not  require members and candidates to disclose referral fees received from or paid to others for the  recommendation of investment products or services  Because the Code and Standards impose  this obligation however members and candidates must disclose the existence of such fees

2,66,Members and candidates must adhere to the following principles 
3,66,  Members and candidates must comply with applicable laws or regulations related to their  professional activities 
4,66,  Members and candidates must not engage in conduct that constitutes a violation of the  Code and Standards even though it may otherwise be legal 
5,66,  In the absence of any applicable law or regulation or when the Code and Standards  impose a higher degree of responsibility than applicable laws and regulations members  and candidates must adhere to the Code and Standards  Applications of these principles  are outlined in Exhibit   
6,66,The applicable laws governing the responsibilities of a member or candidate should be viewed  as the minimal threshold of acceptable actions  When members and candidates take actions that  exceed the minimal requirements they further support the conduct required of Standard I A  
7,66,CFA Institute members are obligated to abide by the CFA Institute Articles of Incorporation  Bylaws Code of Ethics Standards of Professional Conduct Rules of Procedure Membership  Agreement and other applicable rules promulgated by CFA Institute all as amended  periodically  CFA candidates who are not members must also abide by these documents  except  for the Membership Agreement  as well as rules and regulations related to the administration of  the CFA examination the Candidate Responsibility Statement and the Candidate Pledge 
8,66,Participation in or Association with Violations by Others
9,66,Members and candidates are responsible for violations in which they knowingly participate or  assist  Although members and candidates are presumed to have knowledge of all applicable  laws rules and regulations CFA Institute acknowledges that members may not recognize  violations if they are not aware of all the facts giving rise to the violations  Standard I A   applies when members and candidates know or should know that their conduct may contribute  to a violation of applicable laws rules or regulations or the Code and Standards 
10,66,If a member or candidate has reasonable grounds to believe that imminent or ongoing client or  employer activities are illegal or unethical the member or candidate must dissociate or  separate from the activity  In extreme cases dissociation may require a member or candidate to  leave his or her employment  Members and candidates may take the following intermediate  steps to dissociate from ethical violations of others when direct discussions with the person or  persons committing the violation are unsuccessful  The first step should be to attempt to stop  the behavior by bringing it to the attention of the employer through a supervisor or the firm s  compliance department  If this attempt is unsuccessful then members and candidates have a  responsibility to step away and dissociate from the activity  Dissociation practices will differ on  the basis of the member s or candidate s role in the investment industry  It may include  removing one s name from written reports or recommendations asking for a different  assignment or refusing to accept a new client or continue to advise a current client  Inaction  combined with continuing association with those involved in illegal or unethical conduct may  be construed as participation or assistance in the illegal or unethical conduct

2,67,CFA Institute strongly encourages members and candidates to report potential violations of the  Code and Standards committed by fellow members and candidates  Although a failure to report  is less likely to be construed as a violation than a failure to dissociate from unethical conduct  the impact of inactivity on the integrity of capital markets can be significant  Although the Code  and Standards do not compel members and candidates to report violations to their governmental  or regulatory organizations unless such disclosure is mandatory under applicable law  voluntary  reporting is often referred to as whistleblowing  such disclosure may be prudent under certain  circumstances  Members and candidates should consult their legal and compliance advisers for  guidance 
3,67,Additionally CFA Institute encourages members nonmembers clients and the investing public  to report violations of the Code and Standards by CFA Institute members or CFA candidates by  submitting a complaint in writing to the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program via e mail   pcprogram cfainstitute org  or the CFA Institute website  www cfainstitute org  
4,67,Investment Products and Applicable Laws
5,67,Members and candidates involved in creating or maintaining investment services or investment  products or packages of securities and or derivatives should be mindful of where these products  or packages will be sold as well as their places of origination  The applicable laws and  regulations of the countries or regions of origination and expected sale should be understood by  those responsible for the supervision of the services or creation and maintenance of the products  or packages  Members or candidates should make reasonable efforts to review whether  associated firms that are distributing products or services developed by their employing firm  also abide by the laws and regulations of the countries and regions of distribution  Members and  candidates should undertake the necessary due diligence when transacting cross border business  to understand the multiple applicable laws and regulations in order to protect the reputation of  their firm and themselves 
6,67,Given the complexity that can arise with business transactions in today s market there may be  some uncertainty surrounding which laws or regulations are considered applicable when  activities are being conducted in multiple jurisdictions  Members and candidates should seek  the appropriate guidance potentially including the firm s compliance or legal departments and  legal counsel outside the organization to gain a reasonable understanding of their  responsibilities and how to implement them appropriately 
7,67,Exhibit    Global Application of the Code and Standards
8,67,Members and candidates who practice in multiple jurisdictions may be subject to  varied securities laws and regulations  If applicable law is stricter than the  requirements of the Code and Standards members and candidates must adhere to  applicable law  otherwise they must adhere to the Code and Standards  The following  chart provides illustrations involving a member who may be subject to the securities  laws and regulations of three different types of countries

7,69,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
8,69,Members and Candidates
9,69,Suggested methods by which members and candidates can acquire and maintain understanding  of applicable laws rules and regulations include the following 
10,69,  Stay informed  Members and candidates should establish or encourage their employers to  establish a procedure by which employees are regularly informed about changes in  applicable laws rules regulations and case law  In many instances the employer s  compliance department or legal counsel can provide such information in the form of  memorandums distributed to employees in the organization  Also participation in an  internal or external continuing education program is a practical method of staying current 
11,69,  Review procedures  Members and candidates should review or encourage their  employers to review the firm s written compliance procedures on a regular basis to  ensure that the procedures reflect current law and provide adequate guidance to  employees about what is permissible conduct under the law and or the Code and  Standards  Recommended compliance procedures for specific items of the Code and  Standards are discussed in this Handbook in the  Guidance  sections associated with each  standard 
12,69,  Maintain current files  Members and candidates should maintain or encourage their  employers to maintain readily accessible current reference copies of applicable statutes  rules regulations and important cases

2,70,Distribution Area Laws
3,70,Members and candidates should make reasonable efforts to understand the applicable  laws both country and regional for the countries and regions where their investment  products are developed and are most likely to be distributed to clients 
4,70,Legal Counsel
5,70,When in doubt about the appropriate action to undertake it is recommended that a member or  candidate seek the advice of compliance personnel or legal counsel concerning legal  requirements  If a potential violation is being committed by a fellow employee it may also be  prudent for the member or candidate to seek the advice of the firm s compliance department or  legal counsel 
6,70,Dissociation
7,70,When dissociating from an activity that violates the Code and Standards members and  candidates should document the violation and urge their firms to attempt to persuade the  perpetrator s  to cease such conduct  To dissociate from the conduct a member or candidate  may have to resign his or her employment 
8,70,Firms
9,70,The formality and complexity of compliance procedures for firms depend on the nature and size  of the organization and the nature of its investment operations  Members and candidates should  encourage their firms to consider the following policies and procedures to support the principles  of Standard I A  
10,70,  Develop and or adopt a code of ethics  The ethical culture of an organization starts at the  top  Members and candidates should encourage their supervisors or managers to adopt a  code of ethics  Adhering to a code of ethics facilitates solutions when people face ethical  dilemmas and can prevent the need for employees to resort to a  whistleblowing   solution publicly alleging concealed misconduct  CFA Institute has published the Asset  Manager Code of Professional Conduct which firms may adopt or use as the basis for  their codes  visit www cfainstitute org  
11,70,  Provide information on applicable laws  Pertinent information that highlights applicable  laws and regulations might be distributed to employees or made available in a central  location  Information sources might include primary information developed by the  relevant government governmental agencies regulatory organizations licensing  agencies and professional associations  e g  from their websites   law firm  memorandums or newsletters  and association memorandums or publications  e g  CFA  Institute Magazine

3,71,Example    Notification of Known Violations  
4,71,Michael Allen works for a brokerage firm and is responsible for an underwriting of securities  A  company official gives Allen information indicating that the financial statements Allen filed  with the regulator overstate the issuer s earnings  Allen seeks the advice of the brokerage firm s  general counsel who states that it would be difficult for the regulator to prove that Allen has  been involved in any wrongdoing 
5,71,Comment  Although it is recommended that members and candidates seek the  advice of legal counsel the reliance on such advice does not absolve a member or  candidate from the requirement to comply with the law or regulation  Allen should  report this situation to his supervisor seek an independent legal opinion and  determine whether the regulator should be notified of the error 
6,71,Example    Dissociating from a Violation  
7,71,Lawrence Brown s employer an investment banking firm is the principal underwriter for an  issue of convertible debentures by the Courtney Company  Brown discovers that the Courtney  Company has concealed severe third quarter losses in its foreign operations  The preliminary  prospectus has already been distributed 
8,71,Comment  Knowing that the preliminary prospectus is misleading Brown should  report his findings to the appropriate supervisory persons in his firm  If the matter  is not remedied and Brown s employer does not dissociate from the underwriting  Brown should sever all his connections with the underwriting  Brown should also  seek legal advice to determine whether additional reporting or other action should  be taken 
9,71,Example    Dissociating from a Violation  
10,71,Kamisha Washington s firm advertises its past performance record by showing the    year  return of a composite of its client accounts  Washington discovers however that the composite  omits the performance of accounts that have left the firm during the    year period whereas the  description of the composite indicates the inclusion of all firm accounts  This omission has led  to an inflated performance figure  Washington is asked to use promotional material that  includes the erroneous performance number when soliciting business for the firm 
11,71,Comment  Misrepresenting performance is a violation of the Code and Standards   Although she did not calculate the performance herself Washington would be  assisting in violating Standard I A  if she were to use the inflated performance  number when soliciting clients  She must dissociate herself from the activity  If  discussing the misleading number with the person responsible is not an option for  correcting the problem she can bring the situation to the attention of her supervisor  or the compliance department at her firm  If her firm is unwilling to recalculate  performance she must refrain from using the misleading promotional material and  should notify the firm of her reasons  If the firm insists that she use the material  she should consider whether her obligation to dissociate from the activity requires  her to seek other employment

2,72,Example    Following the Highest Requirements  
3,72,James Collins is an investment analyst for a major Wall Street brokerage firm  He works in a  developing country with a rapidly modernizing economy and a growing capital market  Local  securities laws are minimal in form and content and include no punitive prohibitions against  insider trading 
4,72,Comment  Collins must abide by the requirements of the Code and Standards  which might be more strict than the rules of the developing country  He should be  aware of the risks that a small market and the absence of a fairly regulated flow of  information to the market represent to his ability to obtain information and make  timely judgments  He should include this factor in formulating his advice to clients   In handling material nonpublic information that accidentally comes into his  possession he must follow Standard II A  Material Nonpublic Information 
5,72,Example    Following the Highest Requirements  
6,72,Laura Jameson works for a multinational investment adviser based in the United States   Jameson lives and works as a registered investment adviser in the tiny but wealthy island  nation of Karramba  Karramba s securities laws state that no investment adviser registered and  working in that country can participate in initial public offerings  IPOs  for the adviser s  personal account  Jameson believing that as a US citizen working for a US based company  she should comply only with US law has ignored this Karrambian law  In addition Jameson  believes that as a charterholder as long as she adheres to the Code and Standards requirement  that she disclose her participation in any IPO to her employer and clients when such ownership  creates a conflict of interest she is meeting the highest ethical requirements 
7,72,Comment  Jameson is in violation of Standard I A   As a registered investment  adviser in Karramba Jameson is prevented by Karrambian securities law from  participating in IPOs regardless of the law of her home country  In addition  because the law of the country where she is working is stricter than the Code and  Standards she must follow the stricter requirements of the local law rather than the  requirements of the Code and Standards 
8,72,Example    Laws and Regulations Based on Religious Tenets  
9,72,Amanda Janney is employed as a fixed income portfolio manager for a large international firm   She is on a team within her firm that is responsible for creating and managing a fixed income  hedge fund to be sold throughout the firm s distribution centers to high net worth clients  Her  firm receives expressions of interest from potential clients from the Middle East who are  seeking investments that comply with Islamic law  The marketing and promotional materials for  the fixed income hedge fund do not specify whether or not the fund is a suitable investment for  an investor seeking compliance with Islamic law  Because the fund is being distributed  globally Janney is concerned about the reputation of the fund and the firm and believes  disclosure of whether or not the fund complies with Islamic law could help minimize potential  mistakes with placing this investment

2,73,Comment  As the financial market continues to become globalized members and  candidates will need to be aware of the differences between cultural and religious  laws and requirements as well as the different governmental laws and regulations   Janney and the firm could be proactive in their efforts to acknowledge areas where  the new fund may not be suitable for clients 
3,73,Example    Reporting Potential Unethical Actions  
4,73,Krista Blume is a junior portfolio manager for high net worth portfolios at a large global  investment manager  She observes a number of new portfolios and relationships coming from a  country in Europe where the firm did not have previous business and is told that a broker in that  country is responsible for this new business  At a meeting on allocation of research resources to  third party research firms Blume notes that this broker has been added to the list and is  allocated payments for research  However she knows the portfolios do not invest in securities  in the broker s country and she has not seen any research come from this broker  Blume asks  her supervisor about the name being on the list and is told that someone in marketing is  receiving the research and that the name being on the list is OK  She believes that what may be  going on is that the broker is being paid for new business through the inappropriate research  payments and she wishes to dissociate from the misconduct 
5,73,Comment  Blume should follow the firm s policies and procedures for reporting  potential unethical activity which may include discussions with her supervisor or  someone in a designated compliance department  She should communicate her  concerns appropriately while advocating for disclosure between the new broker  relationship and the research payments 
6,73,Example    Failure to Maintain Knowledge of the Law  
7,73,Colleen White is excited to use new technology to communicate with clients and potential  clients  She recently began posting investment information including performance reports and  investment opinions and recommendations to her Facebook page  In addition she sends out  brief announcements opinions and thoughts via her Twitter account  for example  Prospects  for future growth of XYZ company look good   makingmoney U    Prior to White s use of  these social media platforms the local regulator had issued new requirements and guidance  governing online electronic communication  White s communications appear to conflict with  the recent regulatory announcements 
8,73,Comment  White is in violation of Standard I A  because her communications do  not comply with the existing guidance and regulation governing use of social  media  White must be aware of the evolving legal requirements pertaining to new  and dynamic areas of the financial services industry that are applicable to her  She  should seek guidance from appropriate knowledgeable and reliable sources such  as her firm s compliance department external service providers or outside counsel  unless she diligently follows legal and regulatory trends affecting her professional  responsibilities

14,74,Standard I B  states the responsibility of CFA Institute members and candidates in the CFA  Program to maintain independence and objectivity so that their clients will have the benefit of  their work and opinions unaffected by any potential conflict of interest or other circumstance  adversely affecting their judgment  Every member and candidate should endeavor to avoid  situations that could cause or be perceived to cause a loss of independence or objectivity in  recommending investments or taking investment action 
15,74,External sources may try to influence the investment process by offering analysts and portfolio  managers a variety of benefits  Corporations may seek expanded research coverage issuers and  underwriters may wish to promote new securities offerings brokers may want to increase  commission business and independent rating agencies may be influenced by the company  requesting the rating  Benefits may include gifts invitations to lavish functions tickets favors  or job referrals  One type of benefit is the allocation of shares in oversubscribed IPOs to  investment managers for their personal accounts  This practice affords managers the  opportunity to make quick profits that may not be available to their clients  Such a practice is  prohibited under Standard I B   Modest gifts and entertainment are acceptable but special care  must be taken by members and candidates to resist subtle and not so subtle pressures to act in  conflict with the interests of their clients  Best practice dictates that members and candidates  reject any offer of gift or entertainment that could be expected to threaten their independence  and objectivity

2,75,Receiving a gift benefit or consideration from a client can be distinguished from gifts given by  entities seeking to influence a member or candidate to the detriment of other clients  In a client  relationship the client has already entered some type of compensation arrangement with the  member candidate or his or her firm  A gift from a client could be considered supplementary  compensation  The potential for obtaining influence to the detriment of other clients although  present is not as great as in situations where no compensation arrangement exists  When  possible prior to accepting  bonuses  or gifts from clients members and candidates should  disclose to their employers such benefits offered by clients  If notification is not possible prior  to acceptance members and candidates must disclose to their employer benefits previously  accepted from clients  Disclosure allows the employer of a member or candidate to make an  independent determination about the extent to which the gift may affect the member s or  candidate s independence and objectivity 
3,75,Members and candidates may also come under pressure from their own firms to for example  issue favorable research reports or recommendations for certain companies with potential or  continuing business relationships with the firm  The situation may be aggravated if an executive  of the company sits on the bank or investment firm s board and attempts to interfere in  investment decision making  Members and candidates acting in a sales or marketing capacity  must be especially mindful of their objectivity in promoting appropriate investments for their  clients 
4,75,Left unmanaged pressures that threaten independence place research analysts in a difficult  position and may jeopardize their ability to act independently and objectively  One of the ways  that research analysts have coped with these pressures in the past is to use subtle and ambiguous  language in their recommendations or to temper the tone of their research reports  Such  subtleties are lost on some investors however who reasonably expect research reports and  recommendations to be straightforward and transparent and to communicate clearly an analyst s  views based on unbiased analysis and independent judgment 
5,75,Members and candidates are personally responsible for maintaining independence and  objectivity when preparing research reports making investment recommendations and taking  investment action on behalf of clients  Recommendations must convey the member s or  candidate s true opinions free of bias from internal or external pressures and be stated in clear  and unambiguous language 
6,75,Members and candidates also should be aware that some of their professional or social activities  within CFA Institute or its member societies may subtly threaten their independence or  objectivity  When seeking corporate financial support for conventions seminars or even  weekly society luncheons the members or candidates responsible for the activities should  evaluate both the actual effect of such solicitations on their independence and whether their  objectivity might be perceived to be compromised in the eyes of their clients

2,76,Buy Side Clients
3,76,One source of pressure on sell side analysts is buy side clients  Institutional clients are  traditionally the primary users of sell side research either directly or with soft dollar brokerage   Portfolio managers may have significant positions in the security of a company under review  A  rating downgrade may adversely affect the portfolio s performance particularly in the short  term because the sensitivity of stock prices to ratings changes has increased in recent years  A  downgrade may also affect the manager s compensation which is usually tied to portfolio  performance  Moreover portfolio performance is subject to media and public scrutiny which  may affect the manager s professional reputation  Consequently some portfolio managers  implicitly or explicitly support sell side ratings inflation 
4,76,Portfolio managers have a responsibility to respect and foster the intellectual honesty of sell  side research  Therefore it is improper for portfolio managers to threaten or engage in  retaliatory practices such as reporting sell side analysts to the covered company in order to  instigate negative corporate reactions  Although most portfolio managers do not engage in such  practices the perception by the research analyst that a reprisal is possible may cause concern  and make it difficult for the analyst to maintain independence and objectivity 
5,76,Fund Manager and Custodial Relationships
6,76,Research analysts are not the only people who must be concerned with maintaining their  independence  Members and candidates who are responsible for hiring and retaining outside  managers and third party custodians should not accepts gifts entertainment or travel funding  that may be perceived as impairing their decisions  The use of secondary fund managers has  evolved into a common practice to manage specific asset allocations  The use of third party  custodians is common practice for independent investment advisory firms and helps them with  trading capabilities and reporting requirements  Primary and secondary fund managers as well  as third party custodians often arrange educational and marketing events to inform others about  their business strategies investment process or custodial services  Members and candidates  must review the merits of each offer individually in determining whether they may attend yet  maintain their independence 
7,76,Investment Banking Relationships
8,76,Some sell side firms may exert pressure on their analysts to issue favorable research reports on  current or prospective investment banking clients  For many of these firms income from  investment banking has become increasingly important to overall firm profitability because  brokerage income has declined as a result of price competition  Consequently firms offering  investment banking services work hard to develop and maintain relationships with investment  banking clients and prospects  These companies are often covered by the firm s research  analysts because companies often select their investment banks on the basis of the reputation of  their research analysts the quality of their work and their standing in the industry

2,77,In some countries research analysts frequently work closely with their investment banking  colleagues to help evaluate prospective investment banking clients  In other countries because  of past abuses in managing the obvious conflicts of interest regulators have established clear  rules prohibiting the interaction of these groups  Although collaboration between research  analysts and investment banking colleagues may benefit the firm and enhance market efficiency   e g  by allowing firms to assess risks more accurately and make better pricing assumptions  it  requires firms to carefully balance the conflicts of interest inherent in the collaboration  Having  analysts work with investment bankers is appropriate only when the conflicts are adequately  and effectively managed and disclosed  Firm managers have a responsibility to provide an  environment in which analysts are neither coerced nor enticed into issuing research that does  not reflect their true opinions  Firms should require public disclosure of actual conflicts of  interest to investors 
3,77,Members candidates and their firms must adopt and follow perceived best practices in  maintaining independence and objectivity in the corporate culture and protecting analysts from  undue pressure by their investment banking colleagues  The  firewalls  traditionally built  between these two functions must be managed to minimize conflicts of interest  indeed  enhanced firewall policies may go as far as prohibiting all communications between these  groups  A key element of an enhanced firewall is separate reporting structures for personnel on  the research side and personnel on the investment banking side  For example investment  banking personnel should not have any authority to approve disapprove or make changes to  research reports or recommendations  Another element should be a compensation arrangement  that minimizes the pressures on research analysts and rewards objectivity and accuracy   Compensation arrangements should not link analyst remuneration directly to investment  banking assignments in which the analyst may participate as a team member  Firms should also  regularly review their policies and procedures to determine whether analysts are adequately  safeguarded and to improve the transparency of disclosures relating to conflicts of interest  The  highest level of transparency is achieved when disclosures are prominent and specific rather  than marginalized and generic 
4,77,Performance Measurement and Attribution
5,77,Members and candidates working within a firm s investment performance measurement  department may also be presented with situations that challenge their independence and  objectivity  As performance analysts their analyses may reveal instances where managers may  appear to have strayed from their mandate  Additionally the performance analyst may receive  requests to alter the construction of composite indexes owing to negative results for a selected  account or fund  The member or candidate must not allow internal or external influences to  affect their independence and objectivity as they faithfully complete their performance  calculation and analysis related responsibilities

2,78,Public Companies
3,78,Analysts may be pressured to issue favorable reports and recommendations by the companies  they follow  Not every stock is a  buy  and not every research report is favorable for many  reasons including the cyclical nature of many business activities and market fluctuations  For  instance a  good company  does not always translate into a  good stock  rating if the current  stock price is fully valued  In making an investment recommendation the analyst is responsible  for anticipating interpreting and assessing a company s prospects and stock price performance  in a factual manner  Many company managers however believe that their company s stock is  undervalued and these managers may find it difficult to accept critical research reports or  ratings downgrades  Company managers  compensation may also be dependent on stock  performance 
4,78,Due diligence in financial research and analysis involves gathering information from a wide  variety of sources including public disclosure documents  such as proxy statements annual  reports and other regulatory filings  and also company management and investor relations  personnel suppliers customers competitors and other relevant sources  Research analysts may  justifiably fear that companies will limit their ability to conduct thorough research by denying  analysts who have  negative  views direct access to company managers and or barring them  from conference calls and other communication venues  Retaliatory practices include  companies bringing legal action against analysts personally and or their firms to seek monetary  damages for the economic effects of negative reports and recommendations  Although few  companies engage in such behavior the perception that a reprisal is possible is a reasonable  concern for analysts  This concern may make it difficult for them to conduct the comprehensive  research needed to make objective recommendations  For further information and guidance  members and candidates should refer to the CFA Institute publication Best Practice Guidelines  Governing Analyst Corporate Issuer Relations  www cfainstitute org  
5,78,Credit Rating Agency Opinions
6,78,Credit rating agencies provide a service by grading the fixed income products offered by  companies  Analysts face challenges related to incentives and compensation schemes that may  be tied to the final rating and successful placement of the product  Members and candidates  employed at rating agencies should ensure that procedures and processes at the agencies prevent  undue influences from a sponsoring company during the analysis  Members and candidates  should abide by their agencies  and the industry s standards of conduct regarding the analytical  process and the distribution of their reports 
7,78,The work of credit rating agencies also raises concerns similar to those inherent in investment  banking relationships  Analysts may face pressure to issue ratings at a specific level because of  other services the agency offers companies namely advising on the development of structured  products  The rating agencies need to develop the necessary firewalls and protections to allow  the independent operations of their different business lines 
8,78,When using information provided by credit rating agencies members and candidates should be  mindful of the potential conflicts of interest  And because of the potential conflicts members  and candidates may need to independently validate the rating granted

2,79,Influence during the Manager Selection Procurement Process
3,79,Members and candidates may find themselves on either side of the manager selection process   An individual may be on the hiring side as a representative of a pension organization or an  investment committee member of an endowment or a charitable organization  Additionally  other members may be representing their organizations in attempts to earn new investment  allocation mandates  The responsibility of members and candidates to maintain their  independence and objectivity extends to the hiring or firing of those who provide business  services beyond investment management 
4,79,When serving in a hiring capacity members and candidates should not solicit gifts  contributions or other compensation that may affect their independence and objectivity   Solicitations do not have to benefit members and candidates personally to conflict with  Standard I B   Requesting contributions to a favorite charity or political organization may also  be perceived as an attempt to influence the decision making process  Additionally members  and candidates serving in a hiring capacity should refuse gifts donations and other offered  compensation that may be perceived to influence their decision making process 
5,79,When working to earn a new investment allocation members and candidates should not offer  gifts contributions or other compensation to influence the decision of the hiring representative   The offering of these items with the intent to impair the independence and objectivity of another  person would not comply with Standard I B   Such prohibited actions may include offering  donations to a charitable organization or political candidate referred by the hiring  representative 
6,79,A clear example of improperly influencing hiring representatives was displayed in the  pay to  play  scandal involving government sponsored pension funds in the United States  Managers  looking to gain lucrative allocations from the large funds made requested donations to the  political campaigns of individuals directly responsible for the hiring decisions  This scandal and  other similar events have led to new laws requiring additional reporting concerning political  contributions and bans on hiring or hiring delays for managers that made campaign  contributions to representatives associated with the decision making process 
7,79,Issuer Paid Research
8,79,In light of the recent reduction of sell side research coverage many companies seeking to  increase visibility both in the financial markets and with potential investors have hired analysts  to produce research reports analyzing their companies  These reports bridge the gap created by  the lack of coverage and can be an effective method of communicating with investors 
9,79,Issuer paid research conducted by independent analysts however is fraught with potential  conflicts  Depending on how the research is written and distributed investors may be misled  into believing that the research is from an independent source when in reality it has been paid  for by the subject company 
10,79,Members and candidates must adhere to strict standards of conduct that govern how the  research is to be conducted and what disclosures must be made in the report  Analysts must  engage in thorough independent and unbiased analysis and must fully disclose potential  conflicts of interest including the nature of their compensation  Otherwise analysts risk  misleading investors

2,80,Investors need clear credible and thorough information about companies and they need  research based on independent thought  At a minimum issuer paid research should include a  thorough analysis of the company s financial statements based on publicly disclosed  information benchmarking within a peer group and industry analysis  Analysts must exercise  diligence independence and thoroughness in conducting their research in an objective manner   Analysts must distinguish between fact and opinion in their reports  Conclusions must have a  reasonable and adequate basis and must be supported by appropriate research 
3,80,Independent analysts must also strictly limit the type of compensation that they accept for  conducting issuer paid research  Otherwise the content and conclusions of the reports could  reasonably be expected to be determined or affected by compensation from the sponsoring  companies  Compensation that might influence the research report could be direct such as  payment based on the conclusions of the report or indirect such as stock warrants or other  equity instruments that could increase in value on the basis of positive coverage in the report  In  such instances the independent analyst has an incentive to avoid including negative information  or making negative conclusions  Best practice is for independent analysts prior to writing their  reports to negotiate only a flat fee for their work that is not linked to their conclusions or  recommendations 
4,80,Travel Funding
5,80,The benefits related to accepting paid travel extend beyond the cost savings to the member or  candidate and his firm such as the chance to talk exclusively with the executives of a company  or learning more about the investment options provided by an investment organization   Acceptance also comes with potential concerns  for example members and candidates may be  influenced by these discussions when flying on a corporate or chartered jet or attending  sponsored conferences where many expenses including airfare and lodging are covered  To  avoid the appearance of compromising their independence and objectivity best practice dictates  that members and candidates always use commercial transportation at their expense or at the  expense of their firm rather than accept paid travel arrangements from an outside company   Should commercial transportation be unavailable members and candidates may accept  modestly arranged travel to participate in appropriate information gathering events such as a  property tour 
6,80,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
7,80,Members and candidates should adhere to the following practices and should encourage their  firms to establish procedures to avoid violations of Standard I B  
8,80,  Protect the integrity of opinions  Members candidates and their firms should establish  policies stating that every research report concerning the securities of a corporate client  should reflect the unbiased opinion of the analyst  Firms should also design compensation  systems that protect the integrity of the investment decision process by maintaining the  independence and objectivity of analysts 
9,80,  Create a restricted list  If the firm is unwilling to permit dissemination of adverse  opinions about a corporate client members and candidates should encourage the firm to  remove the controversial company from the research universe and put it on a restricted  list so that the firm disseminates only factual information about the company

2,81,  Restrict special cost arrangements  When attending meetings at an issuer s headquarters  members and candidates should pay for commercial transportation and hotel charges  No  corporate issuer should reimburse members or candidates for air transportation  Members  and candidates should encourage issuers to limit the use of corporate aircraft to situations  in which commercial transportation is not available or in which efficient movement could  not otherwise be arranged  Members and candidates should take particular care that when  frequent meetings are held between an individual issuer and an individual member or  candidate the issuer should not always host the member or candidate 
3,81,  Limit gifts  Members and candidates must limit the acceptance of gratuities and or gifts to  token items  Standard I B  does not preclude customary ordinary business related  entertainment as long as its purpose is not to influence or reward members or candidates   Firms should consider a strict value limit for acceptable gifts that is based on the local or  regional customs and should address whether the limit is per gift or an aggregate annual  value 
4,81,  Restrict investments  Members and candidates should encourage their investment firms to  develop formal policies related to employee purchases of equity or equity related IPOs   Firms should require prior approval for employee participation in IPOs with prompt  disclosure of investment actions taken following the offering  Strict limits should be  imposed on investment personnel acquiring securities in private placements 
5,81,  Review procedures  Members and candidates should encourage their firms to implement  effective supervisory and review procedures to ensure that analysts and portfolio  managers comply with policies relating to their personal investment activities 
6,81,  Independence policy  Members candidates and their firms should establish a formal  written policy on the independence and objectivity of research and implement reporting  structures and review procedures to ensure that research analysts do not report to and are  not supervised or controlled by any department of the firm that could compromise the  independence of the analyst  More detailed recommendations related to a firm s policies  regarding research objectivity are set forth in the CFA Institute statement Research  Objectivity Standards  www cfainstitute org  
7,81,  Appointed officer  Firms should appoint a senior officer with oversight responsibilities for  compliance with the firm s code of ethics and all regulations concerning its business   Firms should provide every employee with the procedures and policies for reporting  potentially unethical behavior violations of regulations or other activities that may harm  the firm s reputation

2,82,Example    Travel Expenses  
3,82,Steven Taylor a mining analyst with Bronson Brokers is invited by Precision Metals to join a  group of his peers in a tour of mining facilities in several western US states  The company  arranges for chartered group flights from site to site and for accommodations in Spartan Motels  the only chain with accommodations near the mines for three nights  Taylor allows Precision  Metals to pick up his tab as do the other analysts with one exception John Adams an  employee of a large trust company who insists on following his company s policy and paying  for his hotel room himself 
4,82,Comment  The policy of the company where Adams works complies closely with  Standard I B  by avoiding even the appearance of a conflict of interest but Taylor  and the other analysts were not necessarily violating Standard I B   In general  when allowing companies to pay for travel and or accommodations in these  circumstances members and candidates must use their judgment  They must be on  guard that such arrangements not impinge on a member s or candidate s  independence and objectivity  In this example the trip was strictly for business and  Taylor was not accepting irrelevant or lavish hospitality  The itinerary required  chartered flights for which analysts were not expected to pay  The  accommodations were modest  These arrangements are not unusual and did not  violate Standard I B  as long as Taylor s independence and objectivity were not  compromised  In the final analysis members and candidates should consider both  whether they can remain objective and whether their integrity might be perceived  by their clients to have been compromised

2,83,Comment  Fritz s analysis of Metals   Mining must be objective and based solely  on consideration of company fundamentals  Any pressure from other divisions of  his firm is inappropriate  This conflict could have been eliminated if in anticipation  of the offering Hilton Brokerage had placed Metals   Mining on a restricted list  for its sales force 
3,83,Example    Research Independence and Issuer Relationship Pressure  
4,83,As in Example   Walter Fritz has concluded that Metals   Mining stock is overvalued at its  current level but he is concerned that a negative research report might jeopardize a close  rapport that he has nurtured over the years with Metals   Mining s CEO chief finance officer  and investment relations officer  Fritz is concerned that a negative report might result also in  management retaliation for instance cutting him off from participating in conference calls  when a quarterly earnings release is made denying him the ability to ask questions on such  calls and or denying him access to top management for arranging group meetings between  Hilton Brokerage clients and top Metals   Mining managers 
5,83,Comment  As in Example   Fritz s analysis must be objective and based solely on  consideration of company fundamentals  Any pressure from Metals   Mining is  inappropriate  Fritz should reinforce the integrity of his conclusions by stressing  that his investment recommendation is based on relative valuation which may  include qualitative issues with respect to Metals   Mining s management

8,83,Comment  Unethical sales practices create significant potential violations of the  Code and Standards  Warner s opinion of the Milton bonds must not be affected by  internal pressure or compensation  In this case Warner must refuse to push the  Milton bonds unless she is able to justify that the market price has already adjusted  for the operating problem

5,84,Comment  Grant has violated Standard I B  because accepting these substantial  gifts may impede his independence and objectivity  Every member and candidate  should endeavor to avoid situations that might cause or be perceived to cause a loss  of independence or objectivity in recommending investments or taking investment  action  By accepting the trip Grant has opened himself up to the accusation that he  may give the broker favored treatment in return 
6,84,Example    Gifts and Entertainment from Client  
7,84,Theresa Green manages the portfolio of Ian Knowlden a client of Tisbury Investments  Green  achieves an annual return for Knowlden that is consistently better than that of the benchmark  she and the client previously agreed to  As a reward Knowlden offers Green two tickets to  Wimbledon and the use of Knowlden s flat in London for a week  Green discloses this gift to  her supervisor at Tisbury 
8,84,Comment  Green is in compliance with Standard I B  because she disclosed the gift  from one of her clients in accordance with the firm s policies  Members and  candidates may accept bonuses or gifts from clients as long as they disclose them to  their employer because gifts in a client relationship are deemed less likely to affect  a member s or candidate s objectivity and independence than gifts in other  situations  Disclosure is required however so that supervisors can monitor such  situations to guard against employees favoring a gift giving client to the detriment  of other fee paying clients  such as by allocating a greater proportion of IPO stock  to the gift giving client s portfolio  
9,84,Best practices for monitoring include comparing the transaction costs of the  Knowlden account with the costs of other accounts managed by Green and other  similar accounts within Tisbury  The supervisor could also compare the  performance returns with the returns of other clients with the same mandate  This  comparison will assist in determining whether a pattern of favoritism by Green is  disadvantaging other Tisbury clients or the possibility that this favoritism could  affect her future behavior

2,85,Example    Travel Expenses from External Manager  
3,85,Tom Wayne is the investment manager of the Franklin City Employees Pension Plan  He  recently completed a successful search for a firm to manage the foreign equity allocation of the  plan s diversified portfolio  He followed the plan s standard procedure of seeking presentations  from a number of qualified firms and recommended that his board select Penguin Advisors  because of its experience well defined investment strategy and performance record  The firm  claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards  GIPS  and has been  verified  Following the selection of Penguin a reporter from the Franklin City Record calls to  ask if there was any connection between this action and the fact that Penguin was one of the  sponsors of an  investment fact finding trip to Asia  that Wayne made earlier in the year  The  trip was one of several conducted by the Pension Investment Academy which had arranged the  itinerary of meetings with economic government and corporate officials in major cities in  several Asian countries  The Pension Investment Academy obtains support for the cost of these  trips from a number of investment managers including Penguin Advisors  the Academy then  pays the travel expenses of the various pension plan managers on the trip and provides all meals  and accommodations  The president of Penguin Advisors was also one of the travelers on the  trip 
4,85,Comment  Although Wayne can probably put to good use the knowledge he gained  from the trip in selecting portfolio managers and in other areas of managing the  pension plan his recommendation of Penguin Advisors may be tainted by the  possible conflict incurred when he participated in a trip partly paid for by Penguin  Advisors and when he was in the daily company of the president of Penguin  Advisors  To avoid violating Standard I B  Wayne s basic expenses for travel and  accommodations should have been paid by his employer or the pension plan   contact with the president of Penguin Advisors should have been limited to  informational or educational events only  and the trip the organizer and the  sponsor should have been made a matter of public record  Even if his actions were  not in violation of Standard I B  Wayne should have been sensitive to the public  perception of the trip when reported in the newspaper and the extent to which the  subjective elements of his decision might have been affected by the familiarity that  the daily contact of such a trip would encourage  This advantage would probably  not be shared by firms competing with Penguin Advisors

2,86,Comment  If Herrero accepts this payment arrangement he will be in violation of  Standard I B  because the compensation arrangement can reasonably be expected  to compromise his independence and objectivity  Herrero will receive a bonus for  attracting investors which provides an incentive to draft a positive report  regardless of the facts and to ignore or play down any negative information about  the company  Herrero should accept only a flat fee that is not tied to the  conclusions or recommendations of the report  Issuer paid research that is objective  and unbiased can be done under the right circumstances as long as the analyst takes  steps to maintain his or her objectivity and includes in the report proper disclosures  regarding potential conflicts of interest

4,86,Two years ago Bob Wade trust manager for Central Midas Bank was approached by Western  Funds about promoting its family of funds with special interest in the service fee class of  funds  To entice Central to promote this class Western Funds offered to pay the bank a service  fee of        Without disclosing the fee being offered to the bank Wade asked one of the  investment managers to review Western s funds to determine whether they were suitable for  clients of Central Midas Bank  The manager completed the normal due diligence review and  determined that the new funds were fairly valued in the market with fee structures on a par with  competitors  Wade decided to accept Western s offer and instructed the team of portfolio  managers to exclusively promote these funds and the service fee class to clients seeking to  invest new funds or transfer from their current investments 
5,86,Now two years later the funds managed by Western begin to underperform their peers  Wade  is counting on the fees to reach his profitability targets and continues to push these funds as  acceptable investments for Central s clients 
6,86,Comment  Wade is violating Standard I B  because the fee arrangement has  affected the objectivity of his recommendations  Wade is relying on the fee as a  component of the department s profitability and is unwilling to offer other products  that may affect the fees received

9,86,Bob Thompson has been doing research for the portfolio manager of the fixed income  department  His assignment is to do sensitivity analysis on securitized subprime mortgages  He  has discussed with the manager possible scenarios to use to calculate expected returns  A key  assumption in such calculations is housing price appreciation  HPA  because it drives   prepays   prepayments of mortgages  and losses  Thompson is concerned with the significant  appreciation experienced over the previous five years as a result of the increased availability of  funds from subprime mortgages  Thompson insists that the analysis should include a scenario  run with      for Year       for Year   and then  to project a worst case scenario     for  Years   through    The manager replies that these assumptions are too dire because there has  never been a time in their available database when HPA was negative

3,87,Comment  Thompson s actions in running the worst case scenario against the  protests of the portfolio manager are in alignment with the principles of Standard I  B   Thompson did not allow his research to be pressured by the general trends of  the market or the manager s desire to limit the research to historical norms

6,87,Adrian Mandel CFA is a senior portfolio manager for ZZYY Capital Management who  oversees a team of investment professionals who manage labor union pension funds  A few  years ago ZZYY sought to win a competitive asset manager search to manage a significant  allocation of the pension fund of the United Doughnut and Pretzel Bakers Union  UDPBU    UDPBU s investment board is chaired by a recognized key decision maker and long time leader  of the union Ernesto Gomez  To improve ZZYY s chances of winning the competition Mandel  made significant monetary contributions to Gomez s union reelection campaign fund  Even  after ZZYY was hired as a primary manager of the pension Mandel believed that his firm s  position was not secure  Mandel continued to contribute to Gomez s reelection campaign chest  as well as to entertain lavishly the union leader and his family at top restaurants on a regular  basis  All of Mandel s outlays were routinely handled as marketing expenses reimbursed by  ZZYY s expense accounts and were disclosed to his senior management as being instrumental  in maintaining a strong close relationship with an important client 
7,87,Comment  Mandel not only offered but actually gave monetary gifts benefits and  other considerations that reasonably could be expected to compromise Gomez s  objectivity  Therefore Mandel was in violation of Standard I B  
8,87,Example     Influencing Manager Selection Decisions  
9,87,Adrian Mandel CFA had heard about the manager search competition for the UDPBU Pension  Fund through a broker dealer contact  The contact told him that a well known retired  professional golfer Bobby  The Bear  Finlay who had become a licensed broker dealer  serving as a pension consultant was orchestrating the UDPBU manager search  Finlay had  gained celebrity status with several labor union pension fund boards by entertaining their  respective board members and regaling them with colorful stories of fellow pro golfers  antics  in clubhouses around the world  Mandel decided to improve ZZYY s chances of being invited  to participate in the search competition by befriending Finlay to curry his favor  Knowing  Finlay s love of entertainment Mandel wined and dined Finlay at high profile bistros where  Finlay could glow in the fan recognition lavished on him by all the other patrons  Mandel s  endeavors paid off handsomely when Finlay recommended to the UDPBU board that ZZYY be  entered as one of three finalist asset management firms in its search

3,88,Example     Fund Manager Relationships  
4,88,Amie Scott is a performance analyst within her firm with responsibilities for analyzing the  performance of external managers  While completing her quarterly analysis Scott notices a  change in one manager s reported composite construction  The change concealed the bad  performance of a particularly large account by placing that account into a new residual  composite  This change allowed the manager to remain at the top of the list of manager  performance  Scott knows her firm has a large allocation to this manager and the fund s  manager is a close personal friend of the CEO  She needs to deliver her final report but is  concerned with pointing out the composite change 
5,88,Comment  Scott would be in violation of Standard I B  if she did not disclose the  change in her final report  The analysis of managers  performance should not be  influenced by personal relationships or the size of the allocation to the outside  managers  By not including the change Scott would not be providing an  independent analysis of the performance metrics for her firm 
6,88,Example     Intrafirm Pressure  
7,88,Jill Stein is head of performance measurement for her firm  During the last quarter many  members of the organization s research department were removed because of the poor quality  of their recommendations  The subpar research caused one larger account holder to experience  significant underperformance which resulted in the client withdrawing his money after the end  of the quarter  The head of sales requests that Stein remove this account from the firm s  performance composite because the performance decline can be attributed to the departed  research team and not the client s adviser 
8,88,Comment  Pressure from other internal departments can create situations that cause  a member or candidate to violate the Code and Standards  Stein must maintain her  independence and objectivity and refuse to exclude specific accounts from the  firm s performance composites to which they belong  As long as the client invested  under a strategy similar to that of the defined composite it cannot be excluded  because of the poor stock selections that led to the underperformance and asset  withdrawal

10,89,Trust is the foundation of the investment profession  Investors must be able to rely on the  statements and information provided to them by those with whom the investors have trusted  their financial well being  Investment professionals who make false or misleading statements  not only harm investors but also reduce the level of investor confidence in the investment  profession and threaten the integrity of capital markets as a whole 
11,89,A misrepresentation is any untrue statement or omission of a fact or any statement that is  otherwise false or misleading  A member or candidate must not knowingly omit or misrepresent  information or give a false impression of a firm organization or security in the member s or  candidate s oral representations advertising  whether in the press or through brochures   electronic communications or written materials  whether publicly disseminated or not   In this  context  knowingly  means that the member or candidate either knows or should have known  that the misrepresentation was being made or that omitted information could alter the  investment decision making process 
12,89,Written materials include but are not limited to research reports underwriting documents  company financial reports market letters newspaper columns and books  Electronic  communications include but are not limited to internet communications webpages mobile  applications and e mails  Members and candidates who use webpages should regularly monitor  materials posted on these sites to ensure that they contain current information  Members and  candidates should also ensure that all reasonable precautions have been taken to protect the  site s integrity and security and that the site does not misrepresent any information and does  provide full disclosure 
13,89,Standard I C  prohibits members and candidates from guaranteeing clients any specific return  on volatile investments  Most investments contain some element of risk that makes their return  inherently unpredictable  For such investments guaranteeing either a particular rate of return or  a guaranteed preservation of investment capital  e g   I can guarantee that you will earn    on  equities this year  or  I can guarantee that you will not lose money on this investment   is  misleading to investors  Standard I C  does not prohibit members and candidates from  providing clients with information on investment products that have guarantees built into the  structure of the products themselves or for which an institution has agreed to cover any losses

2,90,Impact on Investment Practice
3,90,Members and candidates must not misrepresent any aspect of their practice including  but not  limited to  their qualifications or credentials the qualifications or services provided by their  firm their performance record and the record of their firm and the characteristics of an  investment  Any misrepresentation made by a member or candidate relating to the member s or  candidate s professional activities is a breach of this standard 
4,90,Members and candidates should exercise care and diligence when incorporating third party  information  Misrepresentations resulting from the use of the credit ratings research  testimonials or marketing materials of outside parties become the responsibility of the  investment professional when it affects that professional s business practices 
5,90,Investing through outside managers continues to expand as an acceptable method of investing  in areas outside a firm s core competencies  Members and candidates must disclose their  intended use of external managers and must not represent those managers  investment practices  as their own  Although the level of involvement of outside managers may change over time  appropriate disclosures by members and candidates are important in avoiding  misrepresentations especially if the primary activity is to invest directly with a single external  manager  Standard V B  Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients discusses in  further detail communicating the firm s investment practices 
6,90,Performance Reporting
7,90,The performance benchmark selection process is another area where misrepresentations may  occur  Members and candidates may misrepresent the success of their performance record  through presenting benchmarks that are not comparable to their strategies  Further clients can  be misled if the benchmark s results are not reported on a basis comparable to that of the fund s  or client s results  Best practice is selecting the most appropriate available benchmark from a  universe of available options  The transparent presentation of appropriate performance  benchmarks is an important aspect in providing clients with information that is useful in making  investment decisions 
8,90,However Standard I C  does not require that a benchmark always be provided in order to  comply  Some investment strategies may not lend themselves to displaying an appropriate  benchmark because of the complexity or diversity of the investments included  Furthermore  some investment strategies may use reference indexes that do not reflect the opportunity set of  the invested assets for example a hedge fund comparing its performance with a  cash plus   basis  When such a benchmark is used members and candidates should make reasonable efforts  to ensure that they disclose the reasons behind the use of this reference index to avoid  misrepresentations of their performance  Members and candidates should discuss with clients  on a continuous basis the appropriate benchmark to be used for performance evaluations and  related fee calculations 
9,90,Reporting misrepresentations may also occur when valuations for illiquid or non traded  securities are available from more than one source  When different options are available  members and candidates may be tempted to switch providers to obtain higher security  valuations  The process of shopping for values may misrepresent a security s worth lead to  misinformed decisions to sell or hold an investment and result in overcharging clients advisory  fees

2,91,Members and candidates should take reasonable steps to provide accurate and reliable security  pricing information to clients on a consistent basis  Changing pricing providers should not be  based solely on the justification that the new provider reports a higher current value of a  security  Consistency in the reported information will improve the perception of the valuation  process for illiquid securities  Clients will likely have additional confidence that they were able  to make an informed decision about continuing to hold these securities in their portfolios 
3,91,Social Media
4,91,The advancement of online discussion forums and communication platforms commonly  referred to as  social media  is placing additional responsibilities on members and candidates   When communicating through social media channels members and candidates should provide  only the same information they are allowed to distribute to clients and potential clients through  other traditional forms of communication  The online or interactive aspects of social media do  not remove the need to be open and honest about the information being distributed 
5,91,Along with understanding and following existing and newly developing rules and regulations  regarding the allowed use of social media members and candidates should also ensure that all  communications in this format adhere to the requirements of the Code and Standards  The  perceived anonymity granted through these platforms may entice individuals to misrepresent  their qualifications or abilities or those of their employer  Actions undertaken through social  media that knowingly misrepresent investment recommendations or professional activities are  considered a violation of Standard I C  
6,91,Omissions
7,91,The omission of a fact or outcome can be misleading especially given the growing use of  models and technical analysis processes  Many members and candidates rely on such models  and processes to scan for new investment opportunities to develop investment vehicles and to  produce investment recommendations and ratings  When inputs are knowingly omitted the  resulting outcomes may provide misleading information to those who rely on it for making  investment decisions  Additionally the outcomes from models shall not be presented as fact  because they represent the expected results based on the inputs and analysis process  incorporated 
8,91,Omissions in the performance measurement and attribution process can also misrepresent a  manager s performance and skill  Members and candidates should encourage their firms to  develop strict policies for composite development to prevent cherry picking situations in  which selected accounts are presented as representative of the firm s abilities  The omission of  any accounts appropriate for the defined composite may misrepresent to clients the success of  the manager s implementation of its strategy

2,92,Plagiarism
3,92,Standard I C  also prohibits plagiarism in the preparation of material for distribution to  employers associates clients prospects or the general public  Plagiarism is defined as copying  or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without acknowledging the  source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of such material  Members and  candidates must not copy  or represent as their own  original ideas or material without  permission and must acknowledge and identify the source of ideas or material that is not their  own 
4,92,The investment profession uses a myriad of financial economic and statistical data in the  investment decision making process  Through various publications and presentations the  investment professional is constantly exposed to the work of others and to the temptation to use  that work without proper acknowledgment 
5,92,Misrepresentation through plagiarism in investment management can take various forms  The  simplest and most flagrant example is to take a research report or study done by another firm or  person change the names and release the material as one s own original analysis  This action is  a clear violation of Standard I C   Other practices include     using excerpts from articles or  reports prepared by others either verbatim or with only slight changes in wording without  acknowledgment     citing specific quotations as attributable to  leading analysts  and   investment experts  without naming the specific references     presenting statistical estimates  of forecasts prepared by others and identifying the sources but without including the qualifying  statements or caveats that may have been used     using charts and graphs without stating their  sources and     copying proprietary computerized spreadsheets or algorithms without seeking  the cooperation or authorization of their creators 
6,92,In the case of distributing third party outsourced research members and candidates may use  and distribute such reports as long as they do not represent themselves as the report s authors   Indeed the member or candidate may add value for the client by sifting through research and  repackaging it for clients  In such cases clients should be fully informed that they are paying  for the ability of the member or candidate to find the best research from a wide variety of  sources  Members and candidates must not misrepresent their abilities the extent of their  expertise or the extent of their work in a way that would mislead their clients or prospective  clients  Members and candidates should disclose whether the research being presented to clients  comes from another source from either within or outside the member s or candidate s firm   This allows clients to understand who has the expertise behind the report or whether the work is  being done by the analyst other members of the firm or an outside party 
7,92,Standard I C  also applies to plagiarism in oral communications such as through group  meetings  visits with associates clients and customers  use of audio video media  which is  rapidly increasing   and telecommunications including electronic data transfer and the outright  copying of electronic media 
8,92,One of the most egregious practices in violation of this standard is the preparation of research  reports based on multiple sources of information without acknowledging the sources  Examples  of information from such sources include ideas statistical compilations and forecasts combined  to give the appearance of original work  Although there is no monopoly on ideas members and  candidates must give credit where it is clearly due  Analysts should not use undocumented  forecasts earnings projections asset values and so on  Sources must be revealed to bring the  responsibility directly back to the author of the report or the firm involved

2,93,Work Completed for Employer
3,93,The preceding paragraphs address actions that would constitute a violation of Standard I C   In  some situations however members or candidates may use research conducted or models  developed by others within the same firm without committing a violation  The most common  example relates to the situation in which one  or more  of the original analysts is no longer with  the firm  Research and models developed while employed by a firm are the property of the firm   The firm retains the right to continue using the work completed after a member or candidate has  left the organization  The firm may issue future reports without providing attribution to the prior  analysts  A member or candidate cannot however reissue a previously released report solely  under his or her name 
4,93,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
5,93,Factual Presentations
6,93,Members and candidates can prevent unintentional misrepresentations of their qualifications or  the services they or their firms provide if each member and candidate understands the limit of  the firm s or individual s capabilities and the need to be accurate and complete in presentations   Firms can provide guidance for employees who make written or oral presentations to clients or  potential clients by providing a written list of the firm s available services and a description of  the firm s qualifications  This list should suggest ways of describing the firm s services  qualifications and compensation that are both accurate and suitable for client or customer  presentations  Firms can also help prevent misrepresentation by specifically designating which  employees are authorized to speak on behalf of the firm  Regardless of whether the firm  provides guidance members and candidates should make certain that they understand the  services the firm can perform and its qualifications 
7,93,Qualification Summary
8,93,In addition to ensure accurate presentations to clients each member and candidate should  prepare a summary of his or her own qualifications and experience and a list of the services the  member or candidate is capable of performing  Firms can assist member and candidate  compliance by periodically reviewing employee correspondence and documents that contain  representations of individual or firm qualifications 
9,93,Verify Outside Information
10,93,When providing information to clients from a third party members and candidates share a  responsibility for the accuracy of the marketing and distribution materials that pertain to the  third party s capabilities services and products  Misrepresentation by third parties can damage  the member s or candidate s reputation the reputation of the firm and the integrity of the  capital markets  Members and candidates should encourage their employers to develop  procedures for verifying information of third party firms

12,94,Comment  McGuire has violated Standard I C  because the website is misleading to  potential investors  Even if the recommendations are valid and supported with  thorough research his omissions regarding the true relationship between himself  and the companies he covers constitute a misrepresentation  McGuire has also  violated Standard VI A  Disclosure of Conflicts by not disclosing the existence of  an arrangement with the companies through which he receives compensation in  exchange for his services

4,95,Comment  Once the error is discovered Yao must take steps to cease distribution of  the incorrect material and correct the error by informing those who have received  the erroneous information  Because Yao did not knowingly make the  misrepresentation however he did not violate Standard I C   Because his firm  claims compliance with the GIPS standards it must also comply with the GIPS  Guidance Statement on Error Correction in relation to the error

9,96,Steve Swanson is a senior analyst in the investment research department of Ballard and  Company  Apex Corporation has asked Ballard to assist in acquiring the majority ownership of  stock in the Campbell Company a financial consulting firm and to prepare a report  recommending that stockholders of Campbell agree to the acquisition  Another investment firm  Davis and Company had already prepared a report for Apex analyzing both Apex and  Campbell and recommending an exchange ratio  Apex has given the Davis report to Ballard  officers who have passed it on to Swanson  Swanson reviews the Davis report and other  available material on Apex and Campbell  From his analysis he concludes that the common  stocks of Campbell and Apex represent good value at their current prices  he believes however  that the Davis report does not consider all the factors a Campbell stockholder would need to  know to make a decision  Swanson reports his conclusions to the partner in charge who tells  him to  use the Davis report change a few words sign your name and get it out  
10,96,Comment  If Swanson does as requested he will violate Standard I C   He could  refer to those portions of the Davis report that he agrees with if he identifies Davis  as the source  he could then add his own analysis and conclusions to the report  before signing and distributing it

3,97,Claude Browning a quantitative analyst for Double Alpha Inc  returns from a seminar in great  excitement  At that seminar Jack Jorrely a well known quantitative analyst at a national  brokerage firm discussed one of his new models in great detail and Browning is intrigued by  the new concepts  He proceeds to test the model making some minor mechanical changes but  retaining the concepts until he produces some very positive results  Browning quickly  announces to his supervisors at Double Alpha that he has discovered a new model and that  clients and prospective clients should be informed of this positive finding as ongoing proof of  Double Alpha s continuing innovation and ability to add value 
4,97,Comment  Although Browning tested Jorrely s model on his own and even slightly  modified it he must still acknowledge the original source of the idea  Browning  can certainly take credit for the final practical results  he can also support his  conclusions with his own test  The credit for the innovative thinking however  must be awarded to Jorrely

7,97,Comment  Copying verbatim any material without acknowledgement including  plain language descriptions of the P E multiple and standard deviation violates  Standard I C   Even though these concepts are general best practice would be for  Zubia to describe them in his own words or cite the sources from which the  descriptions are quoted  Members and candidates would be violating Standard I C   if they either were responsible for creating marketing materials without attribution  or knowingly use plagiarized materials

2,98,Comment  In all instances a member or candidate must cite the actual source of the  information  Best practice for Schneider would be to obtain the information directly  from the author and review it before citing it in a report  In that case Schneider  would not need to report how she found out about the information  For example  suppose Schneider read in the Financial Times about a study issued by CFA  Institute  best practice for Schneider would be to obtain a copy of the study from  CFA Institute review it and then cite it in her report  If she does not use any  interpretation of the report from the Financial Times and the newspaper does not  add value to the report itself the newspaper is merely a conduit of the original  information and does not need to be cited  If she does not obtain the report and  review the information Schneider runs the risk of relying on second hand  information that may misstate facts  If for example the Financial Times erroneously reported some information from the original CFA Institute study and  Schneider copied that erroneous information without acknowledging CFA Institute  she could be the object of complaints  Best practice would be either to obtain the  complete study from its original author and cite only that author or to use the  information provided by the intermediary and cite both sources

5,98,Comment  Ostrowski can rely on third party research that has a reasonable and  adequate basis but he cannot imply that he is the author of such research  If he  does Ostrowski is misrepresenting the extent of his work in a way that misleads  the firm s clients or prospective clients

7,98,Tom Stafford is part of a team within Appleton Investment Management responsible for  managing a pool of assets for Open Air Bank which distributes structured securities to offshore  clients  He becomes aware that Open Air is promoting the structured securities as a much less  risky investment than the investment management policy followed by him and the team to  manage the original pool of assets  Also Open Air has procured an independent rating for the  pool that significantly overstates the quality of the investments  Stafford communicates his  concerns to his supervisor who responds that Open Air owns the product and is responsible for  all marketing and distribution  Stafford s supervisor goes on to say that the product is outside of  the US regulatory regime that Appleton follows and that all risks of the product are disclosed at  the bottom of page     of the prospectus 
8,98,Comment  As a member of the investment team Stafford is qualified to recognize  the degree of accuracy of the materials that characterize the portfolio and he is  correct to be worried about Appleton s responsibility for a misrepresentation of the  risks  Thus he should continue to pursue the issue of Open Air s inaccurate  promotion of the portfolio according to the firm s policies and procedures

3,99,Example     Avoiding a Misrepresentation  
4,99,Trina Smith is a fixed income portfolio manager at a pension fund  She has observed that the  market for highly structured mortgages is the focus of salespeople she meets and that these  products represent a significant number of trading opportunities  In discussions about this topic  with her team Smith learns that calculating yields on changing cash flows within the deal  structure requires very specialized vendor software  After more research they find out that each  deal is unique and that deals can have more than a dozen layers and changing cash flow  priorities  Smith comes to the conclusion that because of the complexity of these securities the  team cannot effectively distinguish between potentially good and bad investment options  To  avoid misrepresenting their understanding the team decides that the highly structured mortgage  segment of the securitized market should not become part of the core of the fund s portfolio   they will allow some of the less complex securities to be part of the core 
5,99,Comment  Smith is in compliance with Standard I C  by not investing in securities  that she and her team cannot effectively understand  Because she is not able to  describe the risk and return profile of the securities to the pension fund  beneficiaries and trustees she appropriately limits the fund s exposure to this  sector 
6,99,Example     Misrepresenting Composite Construction  
7,99,Robert Palmer is head of performance for a fund manager  When asked to provide performance  numbers to fund rating agencies he avoids mentioning that the fund manager is quite liberal in  composite construction  The reason accounts are included excluded is not fully explained  The  performance values reported to the rating agencies for the composites although accurate for the  accounts shown each period may not present a true representation of the fund manager s  ability 
8,99,Comment   Cherry picking  accounts to include in either published reports or  information provided to rating agencies conflicts with Standard I C   Moving  accounts into or out of a composite to influence the overall performance results  materially misrepresents the reported values over time  Palmer should work with  his firm to strengthen its reporting practices concerning composite construction to  avoid misrepresenting the firm s track record or the quality of the information  being provided

2,100,Finch knows that some of the fact sheets are out of date  for example one long only fund  approved the use of significant leverage last quarter as a method to enhance returns  He  continues to provide the sheets to the sales team without updates because the bank has no  control over the marketing material released by the mutual fund firms 
3,100,Comment  Finch is violating Standard I C  by providing information that  misrepresents aspects of the funds  By not providing the sales team and ultimately  the clients with the updated information he is misrepresenting the potential risks  associated with the funds with outdated fact sheets  Finch can instruct the sales  team to clarify the deficiencies in the fact sheets with clients and ensure they have  the most recent fund prospectus document before accepting orders for investing in  any fund 
4,100,Example     Overemphasis of Firm Results  
5,100,Bob Anderson is chief compliance officer for Optima Asset Management Company a firm  currently offering eight funds to clients  Seven of the eight had    year returns below the  median for their respective sectors  Anderson approves a recent advertisement which includes  this statement   Optima Asset Management is achieving excellent returns for its investors  The  Optima Emerging Markets Equity fund for example has    year returns that exceed the sector  median by more than      
6,100,Comment  From the information provided it is difficult to determine whether a  violation has occurred as long as the sector outperformance is correct  Anderson  may be attempting to mislead potential clients by citing the performance of the sole  fund that achieved such results  Past performance is often used to demonstrate a  firm s skill and abilities in comparison to funds in the same sectors 
7,100,However if all the funds outperformed their respective benchmarks then  Anderson s assertion that the company  is achieving excellent returns  may be  factual  Funds may exhibit positive returns for investors exceed benchmarks and  yet have returns below the median in their sectors 
8,100,Members and candidates need to ensure that their marketing efforts do not include  statements that misrepresent their skills and abilities to remain compliant with  Standard I C   Unless the returns of a single fund reflect the performance of a firm  as a whole the use of a singular fund for performance comparisons should be  avoided

2,101,Guidance
3,101,Whereas Standard I A  addresses the obligation of members and candidates to comply with  applicable law that governs their professional activities Standard I D  addresses all conduct  that reflects poorly on the professional integrity good reputation or competence of members  and candidates  Any act that involves lying cheating stealing or other dishonest conduct is a  violation of this standard if the offense reflects adversely on a member s or candidate s  professional activities  Although CFA Institute discourages any sort of unethical behavior by  members and candidates the Code and Standards are primarily aimed at conduct and actions  related to a member s or candidate s professional life 
4,101,Conduct that damages trustworthiness or competence may include behavior that although not  illegal nevertheless negatively affects a member s or candidate s ability to perform his or her  responsibilities  For example abusing alcohol during business hours might constitute a  violation of this standard because it could have a detrimental effect on the member s or  candidate s ability to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities  Personal bankruptcy may  not reflect on the integrity or trustworthiness of the person declaring bankruptcy but if the  circumstances of the bankruptcy involve fraudulent or deceitful business conduct the  bankruptcy may be a violation of this standard 
5,101,In some cases the absence of appropriate conduct or the lack of sufficient effort may be a  violation of Standard I D   The integrity of the investment profession is built on trust  A  member or candidate whether an investment banker rating or research analyst or portfolio  manager is expected to conduct the necessary due diligence to properly understand the nature  and risks of an investment before making an investment recommendation  By not taking these  steps and instead relying on someone else in the process to perform them members or  candidates may violate the trust their clients have placed in them  This loss of trust may have a  significant impact on the reputation of the member or candidate and the operations of the  financial market as a whole 
6,101,Individuals may attempt to abuse the CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program by actively  seeking CFA Institute enforcement of the Code and Standards and Standard I D  in particular  as a method of settling personal political or other disputes unrelated to professional ethics   CFA Institute is aware of this issue and appropriate disciplinary policies procedures and  enforcement mechanisms are in place to address misuse of the Code and Standards and the  Professional Conduct Program in this way 
7,101,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
8,101,In addition to ensuring that their own behavior is consistent with Standard I D  to prevent  general misconduct members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt the  following policies and procedures to support the principles of Standard I D  
9,101,  Code of ethics  Develop and or adopt a code of ethics to which every employee must  subscribe and make clear that any personal behavior that reflects poorly on the individual  involved the institution as a whole or the investment industry will not be tolerated

6,102,Comment  Sasserman s excessive drinking at lunch and subsequent intoxication at  work constitute a violation of Standard I D  because this conduct has raised  questions about his professionalism and competence  His behavior reflects poorly  on him his employer and the investment industry

4,103,Comment  Generally Standard I D  is not meant to cover legal transgressions  resulting from acts of civil disobedience in support of personal beliefs because such  conduct does not reflect poorly on the member s or candidate s professional  reputation integrity or competence

6,103,Meredith Rasmussen works on a buy side trading desk of an investment management firm and  concentrates on in house trades for a hedge fund subsidiary managed by a team at the  investment management firm  The hedge fund has been very successful and is marketed  globally by the firm  From her experience as the trader for much of the activity of the fund  Rasmussen has become quite knowledgeable about the hedge fund s strategy tactics and  performance  When a distinct break in the market occurs and many of the securities involved in  the hedge fund s strategy decline markedly in value Rasmussen observes that the reported  performance of the hedge fund does not reflect this decline  In her experience the lack of effect  is a very unlikely occurrence  She approaches the head of trading about her concern and is told  that she should not ask any questions and that the fund is big and successful and is not her  concern  She is fairly sure something is not right so she contacts the compliance officer who  also tells her to stay away from the issue of the hedge fund s reporting 
7,103,Comment  Rasmussen has clearly come across an error in policies procedures and  compliance practices within the firm s operations  According to the firm s  procedures for reporting potentially unethical activity she should pursue the issue  by gathering some proof of her reason for doubt  Should all internal  communications within the firm not satisfy her concerns Rasmussen should  consider reporting the potential unethical activity to the appropriate regulator

11,104,Trading or inducing others to trade on material nonpublic information erodes confidence in  capital markets institutions and investment professionals by supporting the idea that those with  inside information and special access can take unfair advantage of the general investing public   Although trading on inside information may lead to short term profits in the long run  individuals and the profession as a whole suffer from such trading  These actions have caused  and will continue to cause investors to avoid capital markets because the markets are perceived  to be  rigged  in favor of the knowledgeable insider  When the investing public avoids capital  markets the markets and capital allocation become less efficient and less supportive of strong  and vibrant economies  Standard II A  promotes and maintains a high level of confidence in  market integrity which is one of the foundations of the investment profession 
12,104,The prohibition on using this information goes beyond the direct buying and selling of  individual securities or bonds  Members and candidates must not use material nonpublic  information to influence their investment actions related to derivatives  e g  swaps or option  contracts  mutual funds or other alternative investments  Any trading based on material  nonpublic information constitutes a violation of Standard II A   The expansion of financial  products and the increasing interconnectivity of financial markets globally have resulted in new  potential opportunities for trading on material nonpublic information 
13,104,What Is  Material  Information 
14,104,Information is  material  if its disclosure would probably have an impact on the price of a  security or if reasonable investors would want to know the information before making an  investment decision  In other words information is material if it would significantly alter the  total mix of information currently available about a security in such a way that the price of the  security would be affected

2,105,The specificity of the information the extent of its difference from public information its  nature and its reliability are key factors in determining whether a particular piece of  information fits the definition of material  For example material information may include but  is not limited to information on the following 
3,105,  earnings 
4,105,  mergers acquisitions tender offers or joint ventures 
5,105,  changes in assets or asset quality 
6,105,  innovative products processes or discoveries  e g  new product trials or research  efforts  
7,105,  new licenses patents registered trademarks or regulatory approval rejection of a  product 
8,105,  developments regarding customers or suppliers  e g  the acquisition or loss of a contract  
9,105,  changes in management 
10,105,  change in auditor notification or the fact that the issuer may no longer rely on an auditor s  report or qualified opinion 
11,105,  events regarding the issuer s securities  e g  defaults on senior securities calls of  securities for redemption repurchase plans stock splits changes in dividends changes to  the rights of security holders and public or private sales of additional securities  
12,105,  bankruptcies 
13,105,  significant legal disputes 
14,105,  government reports of economic trends  employment housing starts currency  information etc   
15,105,  orders for large trades before they are executed  and
16,105,  new or changing equity or debt ratings issued by a third party  e g  sell side  recommendations and credit ratings  
17,105,In addition to the substance and specificity of the information the source or relative reliability  of the information also determines materiality  The less reliable a source the less likely the  information provided would be considered material  For example factual information from a  corporate insider regarding a significant new contract for a company is likely to be material  whereas an assumption based on speculation by a competitor about the same contract is likely  to be less reliable and therefore not material  Additionally information about trials of a new  drug product or service under development from qualified personnel involved in the trials is  likely to be material whereas educated conjecture by subject experts not connected to the trials  is unlikely to be material 
18,105,Also the more ambiguous the effect of the information on price the less material that  information is considered  If it is unclear whether and to what extent the information will affect  the price of a security the information may not be considered material  The passage of time  may also render information that was once important immaterial

2,106,What Constitutes  Nonpublic  Information 
3,106,Information is  nonpublic  until it has been disseminated or is available to the marketplace in  general  as opposed to a select group of investors    Disseminated  can be defined as  made  known   For example a company report of profits that is posted on the internet and distributed  widely through a press release or accompanied by a filing has been effectively disseminated to  the marketplace  Members and candidates must have a reasonable expectation that people have  received the information before it can be considered public  It is not necessary however to wait  for the slowest method of delivery  Once the information is disseminated to the market it is  public information that is no longer covered by this standard 
4,106,Members and candidates must be particularly aware of information that is selectively disclosed  by corporations to a small group of investors analysts or other market participants  Information  that is made available to analysts remains nonpublic until it is made available to investors in  general  Corporations that disclose information on a limited basis create the potential for  insider trading violations 
5,106,Issues of selective disclosure often arise when a corporate insider provides material information  to analysts in a briefing or conference call before that information is released to the public   Analysts must be aware that a disclosure made to a room full of analysts does not necessarily  make the disclosed information  public   Analysts should also be alert to the possibility that  they are selectively receiving material nonpublic information when a company provides them  with guidance or interpretation of such publicly available information as financial statements or  regulatory filings 
6,106,A member or candidate may use insider information provided legitimately by the source  company for the specific purpose of conducting due diligence according to the business  agreement between the parties for such activities as mergers loan underwriting credit ratings  and offering engagements  In such instances the investment professional would not be  considered in violation of Standard II A  by using the material information  However the use of  insider information provided by the source company for other purposes especially to trade or  entice others to trade the securities of the firm conflicts with this standard 
7,106,Mosaic Theory
8,106,A financial analyst gathers and interprets large quantities of information from many sources   The analyst may use significant conclusions derived from the analysis of public and  nonmaterial nonpublic information as the basis for investment recommendations and decisions  even if those conclusions would have been material inside information had they been  communicated directly to the analyst by a company  Under the  mosaic theory  financial  analysts are free to act on this collection or mosaic of information without risking violation 
9,106,The practice of financial analysis depends on the free flow of information  For the fair and  efficient operation of the capital markets analysts and investors must have the greatest amount  of information possible to facilitate making well informed investment decisions about how and  where to invest capital  Accurate timely and intelligible communication is essential if analysts  and investors are to obtain the data needed to make informed decisions about how and where to  invest capital  These disclosures must go beyond the information mandated by the reporting  requirements of the securities laws and should include specific business information about items  used to guide a company s future growth such as new products capital projects and the  competitive environment  Analysts seek and use such information to compare and contrast  investment alternatives

2,107,Much of the information used by analysts comes directly from companies  Analysts often  receive such information through contacts with corporate insiders especially investor relations  staff and financial officers  Information may be disseminated in the form of press releases  through oral presentations by company executives in analysts  meetings or conference calls or  during analysts  visits to company premises  In seeking to develop the most accurate and  complete picture of a company analysts should also reach beyond contacts with companies  themselves and collect information from other sources such as customers contractors  suppliers and the companies  competitors 
3,107,Analysts are in the business of formulating opinions and insights that are not obvious to the  general investing public about the attractiveness of particular securities  In the course of their  work analysts actively seek out corporate information not generally known to the market for  the express purpose of analyzing that information forming an opinion on its significance and  informing their clients who can be expected to trade on the basis of the recommendation   Analysts  initiatives to discover and analyze information and communicate their findings to  their clients significantly enhance market efficiency thus benefiting all investors  see Dirks v   Securities and Exchange Commission   Accordingly violations of Standard II A  will not result  when a perceptive analyst reaches a conclusion about a corporate action or event through an  analysis of public information and items of nonmaterial nonpublic information 
4,107,Investment professionals should note however that although analysts are free to use mosaic  information in their research reports they should save and document all their research  see  Standard V C  Record Retention   Evidence of the analyst s knowledge of public and  nonmaterial nonpublic information about a corporation strengthens the assertion that the analyst  reached his or her conclusions solely through appropriate methods rather than through the use  of material nonpublic information 
5,107,Social Media
6,107,The continuing advancement in technology allows members candidates and the industry at  large to exchange information at rates not previously available  It is important for investment  professionals to understand the implications of using information from the internet and social  media platforms because all such information may not actually be considered public 
7,107,Some social media platforms require membership in specific groups in order to access the  published content  Members and candidates participating in groups with membership  limitations should verify that material information obtained from these sources can also be  accessed from a source that would be considered available to the public  e g  company filings  webpages and press releases  
8,107,Members and candidates may use social media platforms to communicate with clients or  investors without conflicting with this standard  As long as the information reaches all clients or  is open to the investing public the use of these platforms would be comparable with other  traditional forms of communications such as e mails and press releases  Members and  candidates as required by Standard I A  should also complete all appropriate regulatory filings  related to information distributed through social media platforms

2,108,Using Industry Experts
3,108,The increased demand for insights for understanding the complexities of some industries has  led to an expansion of engagement with outside experts  As the level of engagement increased  new businesses formed to connect analysts and investors with individuals who have specialized  knowledge of their industry  e g  technology or pharmaceuticals   These networks offer  investors the opportunity to reach beyond their usual business circles to speak with experts  regarding economic conditions industry trends and technical issues relating to specific  products and services 
4,108,Members and candidates may provide compensation to individuals for their insights without  violating this standard  However members and candidates are ultimately responsible for  ensuring that they are not requesting or acting on confidential information received from  external experts which is in violation of security regulations and laws or duties to others  As the  recent string of insider trading cases displayed some experts are willing to provide confidential  and protected information for the right incentive 
5,108,Firms connecting experts with members or candidates often require both parties to sign  agreements concerning the disclosure of material nonpublic information  Even with the  protections from such compliance practices if an expert provides material nonpublic  information members and candidates would be prohibited from taking investment actions on  the associated firm until the information became publicly known to the market 
6,108,Investment Research Reports
7,108,When a particularly well known or respected analyst issues a report or makes changes to his or  her recommendation that information alone may have an effect on the market and thus may be  considered material  Theoretically under Standard II A  such a report would have to be made  public at the time it was distributed to clients  The analyst is not a company insider however  and does not have access to inside information  Presumably the analyst created the report from  information available to the public  mosaic theory  and by using his or her expertise to interpret  the information  The analyst s hard work paid for by the client generated the conclusions 
8,108,Simply because the public in general would find the conclusions material does not require that  the analyst make his or her work public  Investors who are not clients of the analyst can either  do the work themselves or become clients of the analyst to gain access to the analyst s  expertise 
9,108,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
10,108,Achieve Public Dissemination
11,108,If a member or candidate determines that information is material the member or candidate  should make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information  These  efforts usually entail encouraging the issuing company to make the information public  If public  dissemination is not possible the member or candidate must communicate the information only  to the designated supervisory and compliance personnel within the member s or candidate s  firm and must not take investment action or alter current investment recommendations on the  basis of the information  Moreover members and candidates must not knowingly engage in any  conduct that may induce company insiders to privately disclose material nonpublic information

2,109,Adopt Compliance Procedures
3,109,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to adopt compliance procedures to  prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information  Particularly important is improving  compliance in such areas as the review of employee and proprietary trading the review of  investment recommendations documentation of firm procedures and the supervision of  interdepartmental communications in multiservice firms  Compliance procedures should suit the  particular characteristics of a firm including its size and the nature of its business 
4,109,Members and candidates are encouraged to inform their supervisor and compliance personnel of  suspected inappropriate use of material nonpublic information as the basis for security trading  activities or recommendations being made within their firm 
5,109,Adopt Disclosure Procedures
6,109,Members and candidates should encourage their firms to develop and follow disclosure policies  designed to ensure that information is disseminated to the marketplace in an equitable manner   For example analysts from small firms should receive the same information and attention from  a company as analysts from large firms receive  Similarly companies should not provide  certain information to buy side analysts but not to sell side analysts or vice versa  Furthermore  a company should not discriminate among analysts in the provision of information or   blackball  particular analysts who have given negative reports on the company in the past 
7,109,Within investment and research firms members and candidates should encourage the  development of and compliance with procedures for distributing new and updated investment  opinions to clients  Recommendations of this nature may represent material market moving  information that needs to be communicated to all clients fairly 
8,109,Issue Press Releases
9,109,Companies should consider issuing press releases prior to analyst meetings and conference calls  and scripting those meetings and calls to decrease the chance that further information will be  disclosed  If material nonpublic information is disclosed for the first time in an analyst meeting  or call the company should promptly issue a press release or otherwise make the information  publicly available 
10,109,Firewall Elements
11,109,An information barrier commonly referred to as a  firewall  is the most widely used approach  for preventing the communication of material nonpublic information within firms  It restricts  the flow of confidential information to those who need to know the information to perform their  jobs effectively  The minimum elements of such a system include but are not limited to the  following 
12,109,  substantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications preferably through a  clearance area within the firm in either the compliance or legal department 
13,109,  review of employee trading through the maintenance of  watch   restricted  and   rumor  lists

2,110,  documentation of the procedures designed to limit the flow of information between  departments and of the actions taken to enforce those procedures  and
3,110,  heightened review or restriction of proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of  material nonpublic information 
4,110,Appropriate Interdepartmental Communications
5,110,Although documentation requirements must for practical reasons take into account the  differences between the activities of small firms and those of large multiservice firms firms of  all sizes and types benefit by improving the documentation of their internal enforcement of  firewall procedures  Therefore even at small firms procedures concerning interdepartmental  communication the review of trading activity and the investigation of possible violations  should be compiled and formalized 
6,110,Physical Separation of Departments
7,110,As a practical matter to the greatest extent possible firms should consider the physical  separation of departments and files to prevent the communication of sensitive information that  should not be shared  For example the investment banking and corporate finance areas of a  brokerage firm should be separated from the sales and research departments and a bank s  commercial lending department should be segregated from its trust and research departments 
8,110,Prevention of Personnel Overlap
9,110,There should be no overlap of personnel between the investment banking and corporate finance  areas of a brokerage firm and the sales and research departments or between a bank s  commercial lending department and its trust and research departments  For a firewall to be  effective in a multiservice firm an employee should be on only one side of the firewall at any  time  Inside knowledge may not be limited to information about a specific offering or the  current financial condition of a company  Analysts may be exposed to much information about  the company including new product developments or future budget projections that clearly  constitute inside knowledge and thus preclude the analyst from returning to his or her research  function  For example an analyst who follows a particular company may provide limited  assistance to the investment bankers under carefully controlled circumstances when the firm s  investment banking department is involved in a deal with the company  That analyst must then  be treated as though he or she were an investment banker  the analyst must remain on the  investment banking side of the wall until any information he or she learns is publicly disclosed   In short the analyst cannot use any information learned in the course of the project for research  purposes and cannot share that information with colleagues in the research department

2,111,A Reporting System
3,111,A primary objective of an effective firewall procedure is to establish a reporting system in  which authorized people review and approve communications between departments  If an  employee behind a firewall believes that he or she needs to share confidential information with  someone on the other side of the wall the employee should consult a designated compliance  officer to determine whether sharing the information is necessary and how much information  should be shared  If the sharing is necessary the compliance officer should coordinate the  process of  looking over the wall  so that the necessary information will be shared and the  integrity of the procedure will be maintained 
4,111,A single supervisor or compliance officer should have the specific authority and responsibility  of deciding whether information is material and whether it is sufficiently public to be used as  the basis for investment decisions  Ideally the supervisor or compliance officer responsible for  communicating information to a firm s research or brokerage area would not be a member of  that area 
5,111,Personal Trading Limitations
6,111,Firms should consider restrictions or prohibitions on personal trading by employees and should  carefully monitor both proprietary trading and personal trading by employees  Firms should  require employees to make periodic reports  to the extent that such reporting is not already  required by securities laws  of their own transactions and transactions made for the benefit of  family members  Securities should be placed on a restricted list when a firm has or may have  material nonpublic information  The broad distribution of a restricted list often triggers the sort  of trading the list was developed to avoid  Therefore a watch list shown to only the few people  responsible for compliance should be used to monitor transactions in specified securities  The  use of a watch list in combination with a restricted list is an increasingly common means of  ensuring effective control of personal trading 
7,111,Record Maintenance
8,111,Multiservice firms should maintain written records of the communications between various  departments  Firms should place a high priority on training and should consider instituting  comprehensive training programs particularly for employees in sensitive areas

2,112,Proprietary Trading Procedures
3,112,Procedures concerning the restriction or review of a firm s proprietary trading while the firm  possesses material nonpublic information will necessarily depend on the types of proprietary  trading in which the firm may engage  A prohibition on all types of proprietary activity when a  firm comes into possession of material nonpublic information is not appropriate  For example  when a firm acts as a market maker a prohibition on proprietary trading may be  counterproductive to the goals of maintaining the confidentiality of information and market  liquidity  This concern is particularly important in the relationships between small regional  broker dealers and small issuers  In many situations a firm will take a small issuer public with  the understanding that the firm will continue to be a market maker in the stock  In such  instances a withdrawal by the firm from market making activities would be a clear tip to  outsiders  Firms that continue market making activity while in the possession of material  nonpublic information should however instruct their market makers to remain passive with  respect to the market that is to take only the contra side of unsolicited customer trades 
4,112,In risk arbitrage trading the case for a trading prohibition is more compelling than it is in the  case of market making  The impetus for arbitrage trading is neither passive nor reactive and the  potential for illegal profits is greater than in market making  The most prudent course for firms  is to suspend arbitrage activity when a security is placed on the watch list  Those firms that  continue arbitrage activity face a high hurdle in proving the adequacy of their internal  procedures for preventing trading on material nonpublic information and must demonstrate a  stringent review and documentation of firm trades 
5,112,Communication to All Employees
6,112,Members and candidates should encourage their employers to circulate written compliance  policies and guidelines to all employees  Policies and guidelines should be used in conjunction  with training programs aimed at enabling employees to recognize material nonpublic  information  Such information is not always clearly identifiable 
7,112,Employees must be given sufficient training to either make an informed decision or to realize  they need to consult a supervisor or compliance officer before engaging in questionable  transactions  Appropriate policies reinforce that using material nonpublic information is illegal  in many countries  Such trading activities based on material nonpublic information undermine  the integrity of the individual the firm and the capital markets

4,113,Samuel Peter an analyst with Scotland and Pierce Incorporated is assisting his firm with a  secondary offering for Bright Ideas Lamp Company  Peter participates via telephone  conference call in a meeting with Scotland and Pierce investment banking employees and  Bright Ideas  CEO  Peter is advised that the company s earnings projections for the next year  have significantly dropped  Throughout the telephone conference call several Scotland and  Pierce salespeople and portfolio managers walk in and out of Peter s office where the  telephone call is taking place  As a result they are aware of the drop in projected earnings for  Bright Ideas  Before the conference call is concluded the salespeople trade the stock of the  company on behalf of the firm s clients and other firm personnel trade the stock in a firm  proprietary account and in employees  personal accounts 
5,113,Comment  Peter has violated Standard II A  because he failed to prevent the  transfer and misuse of material nonpublic information to others in his firm  Peter s  firm should have adopted information barriers to prevent the communication of  nonpublic information between departments of the firm  The salespeople and  portfolio managers who traded on the information have also violated Standard II  A  by trading on inside information

8,113,Comment  Levenson must first determine whether the material information is  public  According to Standard II A  if the company has not made this information  public  a small group forum does not qualify as a method of public dissemination   she cannot use the information

2,114,Comment  Although information on an expected takeover bid may be of the type  that is generally material and nonpublic in this case the source of information is  unreliable so the information cannot be considered material  Therefore Fechtman  is not prohibited from trading the stock on the basis of this information 
3,114,Example    Applying the Mosaic Theory  
4,114,Jagdish Teja is a buy side analyst covering the furniture industry  Looking for an attractive  company to recommend as a buy he analyzes several furniture makers by studying their  financial reports and visiting their operations  He also talks to some designers and retailers to  find out which furniture styles are trendy and popular  Although none of the companies that he  analyzes are a clear buy he discovers that one of them Swan Furniture Company  SFC  may  be in financial trouble  SFC s extravagant new designs have been introduced at substantial cost   Even though these designs initially attracted attention the public is now buying more  conservative furniture from other makers  Based on this information and on a profit and loss  analysis Teja believes that SFC s next quarter earnings will drop substantially  He issues a sell  recommendation for SFC  Immediately after receiving that recommendation investment  managers start reducing the SFC stock in their portfolios 
5,114,Comment  Information on quarterly earnings data is material and nonpublic  Teja  arrived at his conclusion about the earnings drop on the basis of public information  and on pieces of nonmaterial nonpublic information  such as opinions of designers  and retailers   Therefore trading based on Teja s correct conclusion is not  prohibited by Standard II A

7,114,Roger Clement is a senior financial analyst who specializes in the European automobile sector  at Rivoli Capital  Because he has been repeatedly nominated by many leading industry  magazines and newsletters as a  best analyst  for the automobile industry he is widely regarded  as an authority on the sector  After speaking with representatives of Turgot Chariots a  European auto manufacturer with sales primarily in South Korea and after conducting  interviews with salespeople labor leaders his firm s Korean currency analysts and banking  officials Clement analyzed Turgot Chariots and concluded that     its newly introduced model  will probably not meet sales expectations     its corporate restructuring strategy may well face  serious opposition from unions     the depreciation of the Korean won should lead to pressure  on margins for the industry in general and Turgot s market segment in particular and     banks  could take a tougher than expected stance in the upcoming round of credit renegotiations with  the company  For these reasons he changes his conclusion about the company from  market  outperform  to  market underperform   Clement retains the support material used to reach his  conclusion in case questions later arise 
8,114,Comment  To reach a conclusion about the value of the company Clement has  pieced together a number of nonmaterial or public bits of information that affect  Turgot Chariots  Therefore under the mosaic theory Clement has not violated  Standard II A  in drafting the report

4,115,Comment  When Zito receives advance notice of Clement s change of opinion she  knows it will have a material impact on the stock price even if she is not totally  aware of Clement s underlying reasoning  She is not a client of Clement but obtains  early access to the material nonpublic information prior to publication  Her trades  are thus based on material nonpublic information and violate Standard II A  
5,115,Zito further violates the Standard by relaying the information to her father  It would  not matter if he or any other family member traded  the act of providing the  information violates Standard II A   The fact that the information is provided to a  family member does not absolve someone of the prohibition of using or  communicating material nonpublic information

8,115,Comment  Even though Kellogg believes that Mayfield would not break the law by  disclosing inside information and money was lost on the purchase Kellogg should  not have purchased additional shares of National  It is the member s or candidate s  responsibility to make sure before executing investment actions that comments  about earnings are not material nonpublic information  Kellogg has violated  Standard II A

4,116,Comment  Doll s conversation with the senior executive is part of the mosaic of  information used in recommending Boyce  When holding discussions with a firm  executive Doll would need to guard against soliciting or obtaining material  nonpublic information  Before issuing the report the executive s statement about  the continuing development of the product would need to be weighed against the  other known public facts to determine whether it would be considered material

7,116,Comment  There are often rumors and whisper numbers before a release of any  kind  The text message from the other trader would most likely be considered  market noise  Unless Nadler knew that the trader had an ongoing business  relationship with the public firm he had no reason to suspect he was receiving  material nonpublic information that would prevent him from completing the trading  request of the portfolio manager

5,117,Comment  Watson has violated Standard II A  by passing along material nonpublic  information concerning the ongoing product tests which the fund used to trade in  the securities and options of the related company  Watson cannot simply rely on the  agreements signed by individuals who participate in expert networks that state that  he has not received information that would prohibit his trading activity  He must  make his own determination whether information he received through these  arrangements reaches a materiality threshold that would affect his trading abilities

12,117,Standard II B  requires that members and candidates uphold market integrity by prohibiting  market manipulation  Market manipulation includes practices that distort security prices or  trading volume with the intent to deceive people or entities that rely on information in the  market  Market manipulation damages the interests of all investors by disrupting the smooth  functioning of financial markets and lowering investor confidence

2,118,Market manipulation may lead to a lack of trust in the fairness of the capital markets resulting  in higher risk premiums and reduced investor participation  A reduction in the efficiency of a  local capital market may negatively affect the growth and economic health of the country and  may also influence the operations of the globally interconnected capital markets  Although  market manipulation may be less likely to occur in mature financial markets than in emerging  markets cross border investing increasingly exposes all global investors to the potential for  such practices 
3,118,Market manipulation includes     the dissemination of false or misleading information and      transactions that deceive or would be likely to mislead market participants by distorting the  price setting mechanism of financial instruments  The development of new products and  technologies increases the incentives means and opportunities for market manipulation   Additionally the increasing complexity and sophistication of the technologies used for  communicating with market participants have created new avenues for manipulation 
4,118,Information Based Manipulation
5,118,Information based manipulation includes but is not limited to spreading false rumors to induce  trading by others  For example members and candidates must refrain from  pumping up  the  price of an investment by issuing misleading positive information or overly optimistic  projections of a security s worth only to later  dump  the investment  i e  sell it  once the price  fueled by the misleading information s effect on other market participants reaches an  artificially high level 
6,118,Transaction Based Manipulation
7,118,Transaction based manipulation involves instances where a member or candidate knew or  should have known that his or her actions could affect the pricing of a security  This type of  manipulation includes but is not limited to the following 
8,118,  transactions that artificially affect prices or volume to give the impression of activity or  price movement in a financial instrument which represent a diversion from the  expectations of a fair and efficient market and
9,118,  securing a controlling dominant position in a financial instrument to exploit and  manipulate the price of a related derivative and or the underlying asset 
10,118,Standard II B  is not intended to preclude transactions undertaken on legitimate trading  strategies based on perceived market inefficiencies  The intent of the action is critical to  determining whether it is a violation of this standard

2,119,Example    Independent Analysis and Company Promotion  
3,119,The principal owner of Financial Information Services  FIS  entered into an agreement with  two microcap companies to promote the companies  stock in exchange for stock and cash  compensation  The principal owner caused FIS to disseminate e mails design and maintain  several websites and distribute an online investment newsletter all of which recommended  investment in the two companies  The systematic publication of purportedly independent  analyses and recommendations containing inaccurate and highly promotional and speculative  statements increased public investment in the companies and led to dramatically higher stock  prices 
4,119,Comment  The principal owner of FIS violated Standard II B  by using inaccurate  reporting and misleading information under the guise of independent analysis to  artificially increase the stock price of the companies  Furthermore the principal  owner violated Standard V A  Diligence and Reasonable Basis by not having a  reasonable and adequate basis for recommending the two companies and violated  Standard VI A  Disclosure of Conflicts by not disclosing to investors the  compensation agreements  which constituted a conflict of interest

6,119,John Gray is a private investor in Belgium who bought a large position several years ago in  Fame Pharmaceuticals a German small cap security with limited average trading volume  He  has now decided to significantly reduce his holdings owing to the poor price performance  Gray  is worried that the low trading volume for the stock may cause the price to decline further as he  attempts to sell his large position 
7,119,Gray devises a plan to divide his holdings into multiple accounts in different brokerage firms  and private banks in the names of family members friends and even a private religious  institution  He then creates a rumor campaign on various blogs and social media outlets  promoting the company 
8,119,Gray begins to buy and sell the stock using the accounts in hopes of raising the trading volume  and the price  He conducts the trades through multiple brokers selling slightly larger positions  than he bought on a tactical schedule and over time he is able to reduce his holding as desired  without negatively affecting the sale price 
9,119,Comment  John violated Standard II B  by fraudulently creating the appearance  that there was a greater investor interest in the stock through the online rumors   Additionally through his trading strategy he created the appearance that there was  greater liquidity in the stock than actually existed  He was able to manipulate the  price through both misinformation and trading practices

4,120,  Wirewolf s highly respected chief financial officer may be about to join another  company 
5,120,Knowing that Wirewolf has already entered its declared quarter end  quiet period  before  reporting earnings  and thus would be reluctant to respond to rumors  Murphy times the release  of his research report specifically to sensationalize the negative aspects of the message in order  to create significant downward pressure on Wirewolf s stock to the distinct advantage of  Divisadero s hedge fund clients  The report s conclusions are based on speculation not on fact   The next day the research report is broadcast to all of Divisadero s clients and to the usual  newswire services 
6,120,Before Wirewolf s investor relations department can assess the damage on the final trading day  of the quarter and refute Murphy s report its stock opens trading sharply lower allowing  Divisadero s clients to cover their short positions at substantial gains

10,120,Comment  Sekar s plan would be beneficial for his funds  participants but is based  on artificial distortion of both trading volume and the price of the DD stock and  thus constitutes a violation of Standard II B

2,121,Comment  The formal liquidity of a market is determined by the obligations set on  market makers but the actual liquidity of a market is better estimated by the actual  trading volume and bid ask spreads  Attempts to mislead participants about the  actual liquidity of the market constitute a violation of Standard II B   In this  example investors have been intentionally misled to believe they chose the most  liquid instrument for some specific purpose but they could eventually see the  actual liquidity of the contract significantly reduced after the term of the agreement  expires  If the ACME Futures Exchange fully discloses its agreement with  members to boost transactions over some initial launch period it will not violate  Standard II B   ACME s intent is not to harm investors but on the contrary to give  them a better service  For that purpose it may engage in a liquidity pumping  strategy but the strategy must be disclosed

4,121,Emily Gordon an analyst of household products companies is employed by a research  boutique Picador   Co  Based on information that she has gathered during a trip through Latin  America she believes that Hygene Inc  a major marketer of personal care products has  generated better than expected sales from its new product initiatives in South America  After  modestly boosting her projections for revenue and for gross profit margin in her worksheet  models for Hygene Gordon estimates that her earnings projection of US      per diluted share  for the current year may be as much as    too low  She contacts the chief financial officer   CFO  of Hygene to try to gain confirmation of her findings from her trip and to get some  feedback regarding her revised models  The CFO declines to comment and reiterates  management s most recent guidance of US      US      for the year 
5,121,Gordon decides to try to force a comment from the company by telling Picador   Co  clients  who follow a momentum investment style that consensus earnings projections for Hygene are  much too low  she explains that she is considering raising her published estimate by an  ambitious US      to US      per share  She believes that when word of an unrealistically  high earnings projection filters back to Hygene s investor relations department the company  will feel compelled to update its earnings guidance  Meanwhile Gordon hopes that she is at  least correct with respect to the earnings direction and that she will help clients who act on her  insights to profit from a quick gain by trading on her advice 
6,121,Comment  By exaggerating her earnings projections in order to try to fuel a quick  gain in Hygene s stock price Gordon is in violation of Standard II B    Furthermore by virtue of previewing her intentions of revising upward her  earnings projections to only a select group of clients she is in violation of Standard  III B  Fair Dealing  However it would have been acceptable for Gordon to write a  report that
7,121,  framed her earnings projection in a range of possible outcomes
8,121,  outlined clearly the assumptions used in her Hygene models that took into  consideration the findings from her trip through Latin America and

5,122,Example    Manipulating Model Inputs  
6,122,Bill Mandeville supervises a structured financing team for Superior Investment Bank  His  responsibilities include packaging new structured investment products and managing Superior s  relationship with relevant rating agencies  To achieve the best rating possible Mandeville uses  mostly positive scenarios as model inputs scenarios that reflect minimal downside risk in the  assets underlying the structured products  The resulting output statistics in the rating request and  underwriting prospectus support the idea that the new structured products have minimal  potential downside risk  Additionally Mandeville s compensation from Superior is partially  based on both the level of the rating assigned and the successful sale of new structured  investment products but does not have a link to the long term performance of the instruments 
7,122,Mandeville is extremely successful and leads Superior as the top originator of structured  investment products for the next two years  In the third year the economy experiences  difficulties and the values of the assets underlying structured products significantly decline  The  subsequent defaults lead to major turmoil in the capital markets the demise of Superior  Investment Bank and the loss of Mandeville s employment 
8,122,Comment  Mandeville manipulates the inputs of a model to minimize associated  risk to achieve higher ratings  His understanding of structured products allows him  to skillfully decide which inputs to include in support of the desired rating and  price  This information manipulation for short term gain which is in violation of  Standard II B  ultimately causes significant damage to many parties and the capital  markets as a whole  Mandeville should have realized that promoting a rating and  price with inaccurate information could cause not only a loss of price confidence in  the particular structured product but also a loss of investor trust in the system  Such  loss of confidence affects the ability of the capital markets to operate efficiently

13,123,Standard III A  clarifies that client interests are paramount  A member s or candidate s  responsibility to a client includes a duty of loyalty and a duty to exercise reasonable care   Investment actions must be carried out for the sole benefit of the client and in a manner the  member or candidate believes given the known facts and circumstances to be in the best  interest of the client  Members and candidates must exercise the same level of prudence  judgment and care that they would apply in the management and disposition of their own  interests in similar circumstances

2,124,Prudence requires caution and discretion  The exercise of prudence by investment professionals  requires that they act with the care skill and diligence that a reasonable person acting in a like  capacity and familiar with such matters would use  In the context of managing a client s  portfolio prudence requires following the investment parameters set forth by the client and  balancing risk and return  Acting with care requires members and candidates to act in a prudent  and judicious manner in avoiding harm to clients 
3,124,Standard III A  sets minimum expectations for members and candidates when fulfilling their  responsibilities to their clients  Regulatory and legal requirements for such duties can vary  across the investment industry depending on a variety of factors including job function of the  investment professional the existence of an adviser client relationship and the nature of the  recommendations being offered  From the perspective of the end user of financial services  these different standards can be arcane and confusing leaving investors unsure of what level of  service to expect from investment professionals they employ  The single standard of conduct  described in Standard III A  benefits investors by establishing a benchmark for the duties of  loyalty prudence and care and clarifies that all CFA Institute members and candidates  regardless of job title local laws or cultural differences are required to comply with these  fundamental responsibilities  Investors hiring members or candidates who must adhere to the  duty of loyalty prudence and care set forth in this standard can be confident that these  responsibilities are a requirement regardless of any legally imposed fiduciary duties 
4,124,Standard III A  however is not a substitute for a member s or candidate s legal or regulatory  obligations  As stated in Standard I A  members and candidates must abide by the most strict  requirements imposed on them by regulators or the Code and Standards including any legally  imposed fiduciary duty  Members and candidates must also be aware of whether they have   custody  or effective control of client assets  If so a heightened level of responsibility arises   Members and candidates are considered to have custody if they have any direct or indirect  access to client funds  Members and candidates must manage any pool of assets in their control  in accordance with the terms of the governing documents  such as trust documents and  investment management agreements  which are the primary determinant of the manager s  powers and duties  Whenever their actions are contrary to provisions of those instruments or  applicable law members and candidates are at risk of violating Standard III A  
5,124,Understanding the Application of Loyalty Prudence and Care
6,124,Standard III A  establishes a minimum benchmark for the duties of loyalty prudence and care  that are required of all members and candidates regardless of whether a legal fiduciary duty  applies  Although fiduciary duty often encompasses the principles of loyalty prudence and  care Standard III A  does not render all members and candidates fiduciaries  The  responsibilities of members and candidates for fulfilling their obligations under this standard  depend greatly on the nature of their professional responsibilities and the relationships they  have with clients  The conduct of members and candidates may or may not rise to the level of  being a fiduciary depending on the type of client whether the member or candidate is giving  investment advice and the many facts and circumstances surrounding a particular transaction or  client relationship

2,125,Fiduciary duties are often imposed by law or regulation when an individual or institution is  charged with the duty of acting for the benefit of another party such as managing investment  assets  The duty required in fiduciary relationships exceeds what is acceptable in many other  business relationships because a fiduciary is in an enhanced position of trust  Although  members and candidates must comply with any legally imposed fiduciary duty the Code and  Standards neither impose such a legal responsibility nor require all members or candidates to  act as fiduciaries  However Standard III A  requires members and candidates to work in the  client s best interest no matter what the job function 
3,125,A member or candidate who does not provide advisory services to a client but who acts only as  a trade execution professional must prudently work in the client s interest when completing  requested trades  Acting in the client s best interest requires these professionals to use their  skills and diligence to execute trades in the most favorable terms that can be achieved  Members  and candidates operating in such positions must use care to operate within the parameters set by  the client s trading instructions 
4,125,Members and candidates may also operate in a blended environment where they execute client  trades and offer advice on a limited set of investment options  The extent of the advisory  arrangement and limitations should be outlined in the agreement with the client at the outset of  the relationship  For instance members and candidates should inform clients that the advice  provided will be limited to the propriety products of the firm and not include other products  available on the market  Clients who want access to a wider range of investment products would  have the information necessary to decide not to engage with members or candidates working  under these restrictions 
5,125,Members and candidates operating in this blended context would comply with their obligations  by recommending the allowable products that are consistent with the client s objectives and risk  tolerance  They would exercise care through diligently aligning the client s needs with the  attributes of the products being recommended  Members and candidates should place the  client s interests first by disregarding any firm or personal interest in motivating a  recommended transaction 
6,125,There is a large variety of professional relationships that members and candidates have with  their clients  Standard III A  requires them to fulfill the obligations outlined explicitly or  implicitly in the client agreements to the best of their abilities and with loyalty prudence and  care  Whether a member or candidate is structuring a new securitization transaction completing  a credit rating analysis or leading a public company he or she must work with prudence and  care in delivering the agreed on services 
7,125,Identifying the Actual Investment Client
8,125,The first step for members and candidates in fulfilling their duty of loyalty to clients is to  determine the identity of the  client  to whom the duty of loyalty is owed  In the context of an  investment manager managing the personal assets of an individual the client is easily  identified  When the manager is responsible for the portfolios of pension plans or trusts  however the client is not the person or entity who hires the manager but rather the  beneficiaries of the plan or trust  The duty of loyalty is owed to the ultimate beneficiaries

2,126,In some situations an actual client or group of beneficiaries may not exist  Members and  candidates managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate owe the duty of loyalty  prudence and care to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate  The decisions of a  fund s manager although benefiting all fund investors do not have to be based on an individual  investor s requirements and risk profile  Client loyalty and care for those investing in the fund  are the responsibility of members and candidates who have an advisory relationship with those  individuals 
3,126,Situations involving potential conflicts of interest with respect to responsibilities to clients may  be extremely complex because they may involve a number of competing interests  The duty of  loyalty prudence and care applies to a large number of persons in varying capacities but the  exact duties may differ in many respects in accord with the relationship with each client or each  type of account in which the assets are managed  Members and candidates must not only put  their obligations to clients first in all dealings but also endeavor to avoid all real or potential  conflicts of interest 
4,126,Members and candidates with positions whose responsibilities do not include direct investment  management also have  clients  that must be considered  Just as there are various types of  advisory relationships members and candidates must look at their roles and responsibilities  when making a determination of who their clients are  Sometimes the client is easily  identifiable  such is the case in the relationship between a company executive and the firm s  public shareholders  At other times the client may be the investing public as a whole in which  case the goals of independence and objectivity of research surpass the goal of loyalty to a single  organization 
5,126,Developing the Client s Portfolio
6,126,The duty of loyalty prudence and care owed to the individual client is especially important  because the professional investment manager typically possesses greater knowledge in the  investment arena than the client does  This disparity places the individual client in a vulnerable  position  the client must trust the manager  The manager in these situations should ensure that  the client s objectives and expectations for the performance of the account are realistic and  suitable to the client s circumstances and that the risks involved are appropriate  In most  circumstances recommended investment strategies should relate to the long term objectives  and circumstances of the client 
7,126,Particular care must be taken to detect whether the goals of the investment manager or the firm  in conducting business selling products and executing security transactions potentially conflict  with the best interests and objectives of the client  When members and candidates cannot avoid  potential conflicts between their firm and clients  interests they must provide clear and factual  disclosures of the circumstances to the clients 
8,126,Members and candidates must follow any guidelines set by their clients for the management of  their assets  Some clients such as charitable organizations and pension plans have strict  investment policies that limit investment options to certain types or classes of investment or  prohibit investment in certain securities  Other organizations have aggressive policies that do  not prohibit investments by type but instead set criteria on the basis of the portfolio s total risk  and return

2,127,Investment decisions must be judged in the context of the total portfolio rather than by  individual investment within the portfolio  The member s or candidate s duty is satisfied with  respect to a particular investment if the individual has thoroughly considered the investment s  place in the overall portfolio the risk of loss and opportunity for gains tax implications and the  diversification liquidity cash flow and overall return requirements of the assets or the portion  of the assets for which the manager is responsible 
3,127,Soft Commission Policies
4,127,An investment manager often has discretion over the selection of brokers executing  transactions  Conflicts may arise when an investment manager uses client brokerage to purchase  research services a practice commonly called  soft dollars  or  soft commissions   A member  or candidate who pays a higher brokerage commission than he or she would normally pay to  allow for the purchase of goods or services without corresponding benefit to the client violates  the duty of loyalty to the client 
5,127,From time to time a client will direct a manager to use the client s brokerage to purchase goods  or services for the client a practice that is commonly called  directed brokerage   Because  brokerage commission is an asset of the client and is used to benefit that client not the  manager such a practice does not violate any duty of loyalty  However a member or candidate  is obligated to seek  best price  and  best execution  and be assured by the client that the goods  or services purchased from the brokerage will benefit the account beneficiaries   Best  execution  refers to a trading process that seeks to maximize the value of the client s portfolio  within the client s stated investment objectives and constraints  In addition the member or  candidate should disclose to the client that the client may not be getting best execution from the  directed brokerage 
6,127,Proxy Voting Policies
7,127,The duty of loyalty prudence and care may apply in a number of situations facing the  investment professional besides those related directly to investing assets 
8,127,Part of a member s or candidate s duty of loyalty includes voting proxies in an informed and  responsible manner  Proxies have economic value to a client and members and candidates must  ensure that they properly safeguard and maximize this value  An investment manager who fails  to vote casts a vote without considering the impact of the question or votes blindly with  management on nonroutine governance issues  e g  a change in company capitalization  may  violate this standard  Voting of proxies is an integral part of the management of investments 
9,127,A cost benefit analysis may show that voting all proxies may not benefit the client so voting  proxies may not be necessary in all instances  Members and candidates should disclose to  clients their proxy voting policies

11,128,  Diversify  Members and candidates should diversify investments to reduce the risk of  loss unless diversification is not consistent with plan guidelines or is contrary to the  account objectives

2,129,  Vote proxies  In most cases members and candidates should determine who is authorized  to vote shares and vote proxies in the best interests of the clients and ultimate  beneficiaries 
3,129,  Maintain confidentiality  Members and candidates must preserve the confidentiality of  client information 
4,129,  Seek best execution  Unless directed by the client as ultimate beneficiary members and  candidates must seek best execution for their clients   Best execution is defined in the  preceding text  
5,129,  Place client interests first  Members and candidates must serve the best interests of  clients 
6,129,Application of the Standard
7,129,Example    Identifying the Client Plan Participants  
8,129,First Country Bank serves as trustee for the Miller Company s pension plan  Miller is the target  of a hostile takeover attempt by Newton Inc  In attempting to ward off Newton Miller s  managers persuade Julian Wiley an investment manager at First Country Bank to purchase  Miller common stock in the open market for the employee pension plan  Miller s officials  indicate that such action would be favorably received and would probably result in other  accounts being placed with the bank  Although Wiley believes the stock is overvalued and  would not ordinarily buy it he purchases the stock to support Miller s managers to maintain  Miller s good favor toward the bank and to realize additional new business  The heavy stock  purchases cause Miller s market price to rise to such a level that Newton retracts its takeover  bid 
9,129,Comment  Standard III A  requires that a member or candidate in evaluating a  takeover bid act prudently and solely in the interests of plan participants and  beneficiaries  To meet this requirement a member or candidate must carefully  evaluate the long term prospects of the company against the short term prospects  presented by the takeover offer and by the ability to invest elsewhere  In this  instance Wiley acting on behalf of his employer which was the trustee for a  pension plan clearly violated Standard III A   He used the pension plan to  perpetuate existing management perhaps to the detriment of plan participants and  the company s shareholders and to benefit himself  Wiley s responsibilities to the  plan participants and beneficiaries should have taken precedence over any ties of  his bank to corporate managers and over his self interest  Wiley had a duty to  examine the takeover offer on its own merits and to make an independent decision   The guiding principle is the appropriateness of the investment decision to the  pension plan not whether the decision benefited Wiley or the company that hired  him

2,130,Example    Client Commission Practices  
3,130,JNI a successful investment counseling firm serves as investment manager for the pension  plans of several large regionally based companies  Its trading activities generate a significant  amount of commission related business  JNI uses the brokerage and research services of many  firms but most of its trading activity is handled through a large brokerage company Thompson  Inc  because the executives of the two firms have a close friendship  Thompson s commission  structure is high in comparison with charges for similar brokerage services from other firms   JNI considers Thompson s research services and execution capabilities average  In exchange for  JNI directing its brokerage to Thompson Thompson absorbs a number of JNI overhead  expenses including those for rent 
4,130,Comment  JNI executives are breaching their responsibilities by using client  brokerage for services that do not benefit JNI clients and by not obtaining best  price and best execution for their clients  Because JNI executives are not upholding  their duty of loyalty they are violating Standard III A  
5,130,Example    Brokerage Arrangements  
6,130,Charlotte Everett a struggling independent investment adviser serves as investment manager  for the pension plans of several companies  One of her brokers Scott Company is close to  consummating management agreements with prospective new clients whereby Everett would  manage the new client accounts and trade the accounts exclusively through Scott  One of  Everett s existing clients Crayton Corporation has directed Everett to place securities  transactions for Crayton s account exclusively through Scott  But to induce Scott to exert efforts  to send more new accounts to her Everett also directs transactions to Scott from other clients  without their knowledge 
7,130,Comment  Everett has an obligation at all times to seek best price and best  execution on all trades  Everett may direct new client trades exclusively through  Scott Company as long as Everett receives best price and execution on the trades or  receives a written statement from new clients that she is not to seek best price and  execution and that they are aware of the consequence for their accounts  Everett  may trade other accounts through Scott as a reward for directing clients to Everett  only if the accounts receive best price and execution and the practice is disclosed to  the accounts  Because Everett does not disclose the directed trading Everett has  violated Standard III A

9,130,Emilie Rome is a trust officer for Paget Trust Company  Rome s supervisor is responsible for  reviewing Rome s trust account transactions and her monthly reports of personal stock  transactions  Rome has been using Nathan Gray a broker almost exclusively for trust account  brokerage transactions  When Gray makes a market in stocks he has been giving Rome a lower  price for personal purchases and a higher price for sales than he gives to Rome s trust accounts  and other investors 
10,130,Comment  Rome is violating her duty of loyalty to the bank s trust accounts by  using Gray for brokerage transactions simply because Gray trades Rome s personal  account on favorable terms  Rome is placing her own interests before those of her  clients

2,131,Example    Client Commission Practices  
3,131,Lauren Parker an analyst with Provo Advisors covers South American equities for her firm   She likes to travel to the markets for which she is responsible and decides to go on a trip to  Chile Argentina and Brazil  The trip is sponsored by SouthAM Inc  a research firm with a  small broker dealer affiliate that uses the clearing facilities of a larger New York brokerage  house  SouthAM specializes in arranging South American trips for analysts during which they  can meet with central bank officials government ministers local economists and senior  executives of corporations  SouthAM accepts commission dollars at a ratio of   to   against the  hard dollar costs of the research fee for the trip  Parker is not sure that SouthAM s execution is  competitive but without informing her supervisor she directs the trading desk at Provo to start  giving commission business to SouthAM so she can take the trip  SouthAM has conveniently  timed the briefing trip to coincide with the beginning of Carnival season so Parker also decides  to spend five days of vacation in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the trip  Parker uses commission  dollars to pay for the five days of hotel expenses 
4,131,Comment  Parker is violating Standard III A  by not exercising her duty of loyalty  to her clients  She should have determined whether the commissions charged by  SouthAM are reasonable in relation to the benefit of the research provided by the  trip  She also should have determined whether best execution and prices could be  received from SouthAM  In addition the five extra days are not part of the research  effort because they do not assist in the investment decision making  Thus the hotel  expenses for the five days should not be paid for with client assets 
5,131,Example    Excessive Trading  
6,131,Vida Knauss manages the portfolios of a number of high net worth individuals  A major part of  her investment management fee is based on trading commissions  Knauss engages in extensive  trading for each of her clients to ensure that she attains the minimum commission level set by  her firm  Although the securities purchased and sold for the clients are appropriate and fall  within the acceptable asset classes for the clients the amount of trading for each account  exceeds what is necessary to accomplish the client s investment objectives 
7,131,Comment  Knauss has violated Standard III A  because she is using the assets of  her clients to benefit her firm and herself 
8,131,Example    Managing Family Accounts  
9,131,Adam Dill recently joined New Investments Asset Managers  To assist Dill in building a book  of clients both his father and brother opened new fee paying accounts  Dill followed all the  firm s procedures in noting his relationships with these clients and in developing their  investment policy statements 
10,131,After several years the number of Dill s clients has grown but he still manages the original  accounts of his family members  An IPO is coming to market that is a suitable investment for  many of his clients including his brother  Dill does not receive the amount of stock he  requested so to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest he does not allocate any shares to  his brother s account

2,132,Comment  Dill has violated Standard III A  because he is not acting for the benefit  of his brother s account as well as his other accounts  The brother s account is a  regular fee paying account comparable to the accounts of his other clients  By not  allocating the shares proportionately across all accounts for which he thought the  IPO was suitable Dill is disadvantaging specific clients 
3,132,Dill would have been correct in not allocating shares to his brother s account if that  account was being managed outside the normal fee structure of the firm

5,132,Donna Hensley has been hired by a law firm to testify as an expert witness  Although the  testimony is intended to represent impartial advice she is concerned that her work may have  negative consequences for the law firm  If the law firm is Hensley s client how does she ensure  that her testimony will not violate the required duty of loyalty prudence and care to one s  client 
6,132,Comment  In this situation the law firm represents Hensley s employer and the  aspect of  who is the client  is not well defined  When acting as an expert witness  Hensley is bound by the standard of independence and objectivity in the same  manner as an independent research analyst would be bound  Hensley must not let  the law firm influence the testimony she provides in the legal proceedings 
7,132,Example    Identifying the Client  
8,132,Jon Miller is a mutual fund portfolio manager  The fund is focused on the global financial  services sector  Wanda Spears is a private wealth manager in the same city as Miller and is a  friend of Miller  At a local CFA Institute society meeting Spears mentions to Miller that her  new client is an investor in Miller s fund  She states that the two of them now share a  responsibility to this client 
9,132,Comment  Spears  statement is not totally correct  Because she provides the  advisory services to her new client she alone is bound by the duty of loyalty to this  client  Miller s responsibility is to manage the fund according to the investment  policy statement of the fund  His actions should not be influenced by the needs of  any particular fund investor

11,132,After providing client account investment performance to the external facing departments but  prior to it being finalized for release to clients Teresa Nguyen an investment performance  analyst notices the reporting system missed a trade  Correcting the omission resulted in a large  loss for a client that had previously placed the firm on  watch  for potential termination owing  to underperformance in prior periods  Nguyen knows this news is unpleasant but informs the  appropriate individuals that the report needs to be updated before releasing it to the client 
12,132,Comment  Nguyen s actions align with the requirements of Standard III A   Even  though the correction may lead to the firm s termination by the client withholding  information on errors would not be in the best interest of the client

3,133,Baftija Sulejman recently became a candidate in the CFA Program  He is a broker who executes  client directed trades for several high net worth individuals  Sulejman does not provide any  investment advice and only executes the trading decisions made by clients  He is concerned that  the Code and Standards impose a fiduciary duty on him in his dealing with clients and sends an  e mail to the CFA Ethics Helpdesk  ethics cfainstitute org  to seek guidance on this issue 
4,133,Comment  In this instance Sulejman serves in an execution only capacity and his  duty of loyalty prudence and care is centered on the skill and diligence used when  executing trades namely by seeking best execution and making trades within the  parameters set by the clients  instructions on quantity price timing etc    Acting in  the best interests of the client dictates that trades are executed on the most  favorable terms that can be achieved for the client  Given this job function the  requirements of the Code and Standards for loyalty prudence and care clearly do  not impose a fiduciary duty

8,133,Highlights 
9,133,  Investment Recommendations
10,133,  Investment Action
11,133,Standard III B  requires members and candidates to treat all clients fairly when disseminating  investment recommendations or making material changes to prior investment recommendations  or when taking investment action with regard to general purchases new issues or secondary  offerings  Only through the fair treatment of all parties can the investment management  profession maintain the confidence of the investing public 
12,133,When an investment adviser has multiple clients the potential exists for the adviser to favor one  client over another  This favoritism may take various forms from the quality and timing of  services provided to the allocation of investment opportunities

2,134,The term  fairly  implies that the member or candidate must take care not to discriminate  against any clients when disseminating investment recommendations or taking investment  action  Standard III B  does not state  equally  because members and candidates could not  possibly reach all clients at exactly the same time whether by printed mail telephone   including text messaging  computer  including internet updates and e mail distribution   facsimile  fax  or wire  Each client has unique needs investment criteria and investment  objectives so not all investment opportunities are suitable for all clients  In addition members  and candidates may provide more personal specialized or in depth service to clients who are  willing to pay for premium services through higher management fees or higher levels of  brokerage  Members and candidates may differentiate their services to clients but different  levels of service must not disadvantage or negatively affect clients  In addition the different  service levels should be disclosed to clients and prospective clients and should be available to  everyone  i e  different service levels should not be offered selectively  
3,134,Standard III B  covers conduct in two broadly defined categories investment  recommendations and investment action 
4,134,Investment Recommendations
5,134,The first category of conduct involves members and candidates whose primary function is the  preparation of investment recommendations to be disseminated either to the public or within a  firm for the use of others in making investment decisions  This group includes members and  candidates employed by investment counseling advisory or consulting firms as well as banks  brokerage firms and insurance companies  The criterion is that the member s or candidate s  primary responsibility is the preparation of recommendations to be acted on by others including  those in the member s or candidate s organization 
6,134,An investment recommendation is any opinion expressed by a member or candidate in regard to  purchasing selling or holding a given security or other investment  The opinion may be  disseminated to customers or clients through an initial detailed research report through a brief  update report by addition to or deletion from a list of recommended securities or simply by  oral communication  A recommendation that is distributed to anyone outside the organization is  considered a communication for general distribution under Standard III B  
7,134,Standard III B  addresses the manner in which investment recommendations or changes in prior  recommendations are disseminated to clients  Each member or candidate is obligated to ensure  that information is disseminated in such a manner that all clients have a fair opportunity to act  on every recommendation  Communicating with all clients on a uniform basis presents practical  problems for members and candidates because of differences in timing and methods of  communication with various types of customers and clients  Members and candidates should  encourage their firms to design an equitable system to prevent selective or discriminatory  disclosure and should inform clients about what kind of communications they will receive 
8,134,The duty to clients imposed by Standard III B  may be more critical when members or  candidates change their recommendations than when they make initial recommendations   Material changes in a member s or candidate s prior investment recommendations because of  subsequent research should be communicated to all current clients  particular care should be  taken that the information reaches those clients who the member or candidate knows have acted  on or been affected by the earlier advice  Clients who do not know that the member or candidate  has changed a recommendation and who therefore place orders contrary to a current  recommendation should be advised of the changed recommendation before the order is  accepted

2,135,Investment Action
3,135,The second category of conduct includes those members and candidates whose primary  function is taking investment action  portfolio management  on the basis of recommendations  prepared internally or received from external sources  Investment action like investment  recommendations can affect market value  Consequently Standard III B  requires that  members or candidates treat all clients fairly in light of their investment objectives and  circumstances  For example when making investments in new offerings or in secondary  financings members and candidates should distribute the issues to all customers for whom the  investments are appropriate in a manner consistent with the policies of the firm for allocating  blocks of stock  If the issue is oversubscribed then the issue should be prorated to all  subscribers  This action should be taken on a round lot basis to avoid odd lot distributions  In  addition if the issue is oversubscribed members and candidates should forgo any sales to  themselves or their immediate families in order to free up additional shares for clients  If the  investment professional s family member accounts are managed similarly to the accounts of  other clients of the firm however the family member accounts should not be excluded from  buying such shares 
4,135,Members and candidates must make every effort to treat all individual and institutional clients  in a fair and impartial manner  A member or candidate may have multiple relationships with an  institution  for example the member or candidate may be a corporate trustee pension fund  manager manager of funds for individuals employed by the customer loan originator or  creditor  A member or candidate must exercise care to treat all clients fairly 
5,135,Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients the documented  allocation procedures they or their firms have in place and how the procedures would affect the  client or prospect  The disclosure should be clear and complete so that the client can make an  informed investment decision  Even when complete disclosure is made however members and  candidates must put client interests ahead of their own  A member s or candidate s duty of  fairness and loyalty to clients can never be overridden by client consent to patently unfair  allocation procedures 
6,135,Treating clients fairly also means that members and candidates should not take advantage of  their position in the industry to the detriment of clients  For instance in the context of IPOs  members and candidates must make bona fide public distributions of  hot issue  securities   defined as securities of a public offering that are trading at a premium in the secondary market  whenever such trading commences because of the great demand for the securities   Members  and candidates are prohibited from withholding such securities for their own benefit and must  not use such securities as a reward or incentive to gain benefit

2,136,Develop Firm Policies
3,136,Although Standard III B  refers to a member s or candidate s responsibility to deal fairly and  objectively with clients members and candidates should also encourage their firms to establish  compliance procedures requiring all employees who disseminate investment recommendations  or take investment actions to treat customers and clients fairly  At the very least a member or  candidate should recommend appropriate procedures to management if none are in place  And  the member or candidate should make management aware of possible violations of fair dealing  practices within the firm when they come to the attention of the member or candidate 
4,136,The extent of the formality and complexity of such compliance procedures depends on the  nature and size of the organization and the type of securities involved  An investment adviser  who is a sole proprietor and handles only discretionary accounts might not disseminate  recommendations to the public but that adviser should have formal written procedures to  ensure that all clients receive fair investment action 
5,136,Good business practice dictates that initial recommendations be made available to all customers  who indicate an interest  Although a member or candidate need not communicate a  recommendation to all customers the selection process by which customers receive information  should be based on suitability and known interest not on any preferred or favored status  A  common practice to assure fair dealing is to communicate recommendations simultaneously  within the firm and to customers 
6,136,Members and candidates should consider the following points when establishing fair dealing  compliance procedures 
7,136,  Limit the number of people involved  Members and candidates should make reasonable  efforts to limit the number of people who are privy to the fact that a recommendation is  going to be disseminated 
8,136,  Shorten the time frame between decision and dissemination  Members and candidates  should make reasonable efforts to limit the amount of time that elapses between the  decision to make an investment recommendation and the time the actual recommendation  is disseminated  If a detailed institutional recommendation that might take two or three  weeks to publish is in preparation a short summary report including the conclusion might  be published in advance  In an organization where both a research committee and an  investment policy committee must approve a recommendation the meetings should be  held on the same day if possible  The process of reviewing reports and printing and  mailing them faxing them or distributing them by e mail necessarily involves the  passage of time sometimes long periods of time  In large firms with extensive review  processes the time factor is usually not within the control of the analyst who prepares the  report  Thus many firms and their analysts communicate to customers and firm personnel  the new or changed recommendations by an update or  flash  report  The communication  technique might be fax e mail wire or short written report 
9,136,  Publish guidelines for pre dissemination behavior  Members and candidates should  encourage firms to develop guidelines that prohibit personnel who have prior knowledge  of an investment recommendation from discussing or taking any action on the pending  recommendation

2,137,  Simultaneous dissemination  Members and candidates should establish procedures for the  timing of dissemination of investment recommendations so that all clients are treated  fairly that is are informed at approximately the same time  For example if a firm is  going to announce a new recommendation supervisory personnel should time the  announcement to avoid placing any client or group of clients at an unfair advantage  relative to other clients  A communication to all branch offices should be sent at the time  of the general announcement   When appropriate the firm should accompany the  announcement of a new recommendation with a statement that trading restrictions for the  firm s employees are now in effect  The trading restrictions should stay in effect until the  recommendation is widely distributed to all relevant clients   Once this distribution has  occurred the member or candidate may follow up separately with individual clients but  members and candidates should not give favored clients advance information when such  advance notification may disadvantage other clients 
3,137,  Maintain a list of clients and their holdings  Members and candidates should maintain a  list of all clients and the securities or other investments each client holds in order to  facilitate notification of customers or clients of a change in an investment  recommendation  If a particular security or other investment is to be sold such a list can  be used to ensure that all holders are treated fairly in the liquidation of that particular  investment 
4,137,  Develop and document trade allocation procedures  When formulating procedures for  allocating trades members and candidates should develop a set of guiding principles that  ensure
5,137,  fairness to advisory clients both in priority of execution of orders and in the  allocation of the price obtained in execution of block orders or trades
6,137,  timeliness and efficiency in the execution of orders and
7,137,  accuracy of the member s or candidate s records as to trade orders and client  account positions 
8,137,With these principles in mind members and candidates should develop or encourage their firm  to develop written allocation procedures with particular attention to procedures for block trades  and new issues  Procedures to consider are as follows 
9,137,  requiring orders and modifications or cancellations of orders to be documented and time  stamped 
10,137,  processing and executing orders on a first in first out basis with consideration of  bundling orders for efficiency as appropriate for the asset class or the security 
11,137,  developing a policy to address such issues as calculating execution prices and  partial  fills  when trades are grouped or in a block for efficiency 
12,137,  giving all client accounts participating in a block trade the same execution price and  charging the same commission 
13,137,  when the full amount of the block order is not executed allocating partially executed  orders among the participating client accounts pro rata on the basis of order size while not  going below an established minimum lot size for some securities  e g  bonds   and

2,138,  when allocating trades for new issues obtaining advance indications of interest  allocating securities by client  rather than portfolio manager  and providing a method for  calculating allocations 
3,138,Disclose Trade Allocation Procedures
4,138,Members and candidates should disclose to clients and prospective clients how they select  accounts to participate in an order and how they determine the amount of securities each  account will buy or sell  Trade allocation procedures must be fair and equitable and disclosure  of inequitable allocation methods does not relieve the member or candidate of this obligation 
5,138,Establish Systematic Account Review
6,138,Member and candidate supervisors should review each account on a regular basis to ensure that  no client or customer is being given preferential treatment and that the investment actions taken  for each account are suitable for each account s objectives  Because investments should be  based on individual needs and circumstances an investment manager may have good reasons  for placing a given security or other investment in one account while selling it from another  account and should fully document the reasons behind both sides of the transaction  Members  and candidates should encourage firms to establish review procedures however to detect  whether trading in one account is being used to benefit a favored client 
7,138,Disclose Levels of Service
8,138,Members and candidates should disclose to all clients whether the organization offers different  levels of service to clients for the same fee or different fees  Different levels of service should  not be offered to clients selectively

11,138,Bradley Ames a well known and respected analyst follows the computer industry  In the  course of his research he finds that a small relatively unknown company whose shares are  traded over the counter has just signed significant contracts with some of the companies he  follows  After a considerable amount of investigation Ames decides to write a research report  on the small company and recommend purchase of its shares  While the report is being  reviewed by the company for factual accuracy Ames schedules a luncheon with several of his  best clients to discuss the company  At the luncheon he mentions the purchase recommendation  scheduled to be sent early the following week to all the firm s clients 
12,138,Comment  Ames has violated Standard III B  by disseminating the purchase  recommendation to the clients with whom he has lunch a week before the  recommendation is sent to all clients

2,139,Example    Fair Dealing between Funds  
3,139,Spencer Rivers president of XYZ Corporation moves his company s growth oriented pension  fund to a particular bank primarily because of the excellent investment performance achieved  by the bank s commingled fund for the prior five year period  Later Rivers compares the  results of his pension fund with those of the bank s commingled fund  He is startled to learn  that even though the two accounts have the same investment objectives and similar portfolios  his company s pension fund has significantly underperformed the bank s commingled fund   Questioning this result at his next meeting with the pension fund s manager Rivers is told that  as a matter of policy when a new security is placed on the recommended list Morgan Jackson  the pension fund manager first purchases the security for the commingled account and then  purchases it on a pro rata basis for all other pension fund accounts  Similarly when a sale is  recommended the security is sold first from the commingled account and then sold on a pro  rata basis from all other accounts  Rivers also learns that if the bank cannot get enough shares   especially of hot issues  to be meaningful to all the accounts its policy is to place the new  issues only in the commingled account 
4,139,Seeing that Rivers is neither satisfied nor pleased by the explanation Jackson quickly adds that  nondiscretionary pension accounts and personal trust accounts have a lower priority on  purchase and sale recommendations than discretionary pension fund accounts  Furthermore  Jackson states the company s pension fund had the opportunity to invest up to    in the  commingled fund 
5,139,Comment  The bank s policy does not treat all customers fairly and Jackson has  violated her duty to her clients by giving priority to the growth oriented  commingled fund over all other funds and to discretionary accounts over  nondiscretionary accounts  Jackson must execute orders on a systematic basis that  is fair to all clients  In addition trade allocation procedures should be disclosed to  all clients when they become clients  Of course in this case disclosure of the  bank s policy would not change the fact that the policy is unfair

7,139,Dominic Morris works for a small regional securities firm  His work consists of corporate  finance activities and investing for institutional clients  Arena Ltd  is planning to go public   The partners have secured rights to buy an arena football league franchise and are planning to  use the funds from the issue to complete the purchase  Because arena football is the current  rage Morris believes he has a hot issue on his hands  He has quietly negotiated some options  for himself for helping convince Arena to do the financing through his securities firm  When he  seeks expressions of interest the institutional buyers oversubscribe the issue  Morris assuming  that the institutions have the financial clout to drive the stock up then fills all orders  including  his own  and decreases the institutional blocks 
8,139,Comment  Morris has violated Standard III B  by not treating all customers fairly   He should not have taken any shares himself and should have prorated the shares  offered among all clients  In addition he should have disclosed to his firm and to  his clients that he received options as part of the deal  see Standard VI A   Disclosure of Conflicts

4,140,Comment  Preston has violated Standard III B  by failing to deal fairly with her  clients in taking these investment actions  Preston should have allocated the trades  prior to executing the orders or she should have had a systematic approach to  allocating the trades such as pro rata as soon as practical after they were executed   Among other things Preston must disclose to the client that the adviser may act as  broker for receive commissions from and have a potential conflict of interest  regarding both parties in agency cross transactions  After the disclosure she should  obtain from the client consent authorizing such transactions in advance

3,141,Lynn Hampton is a well respected private wealth manager in her community with a diversified  client base  She determines that a new    year bond being offered by Healthy Pharmaceuticals  is appropriate for five of her clients  Three clients request to purchase US       each and the  other two request US       each  The minimum lot size is established at US      and the  issue is oversubscribed at the time of placement  Her firm s policy is that odd lot allocations  especially those below the minimum should be avoided because they may affect the liquidity of  the security at the time of sale 
4,141,Hampton is informed she will receive only US       of the offering for all accounts  Hampton  distributes the bond investments as follows  The three accounts that requested US       are  allocated US      each and the two accounts that requested US       are allocated  US       each 
5,141,Comment  Hampton has not violated Standard III B  even though the distribution  is not on a completely pro rata basis because of the required minimum lot size   With the total allocation being significantly below the amount requested Hampton  ensured that each client received at least the minimum lot size of the issue  This  approach allowed the clients to efficiently sell the bond later if necessary

7,141,Ling Chan manages the accounts for many pension plans including the plan of his father s  employer  Chan developed similar but not identical investment policies for each client so the  investment portfolios are rarely the same  To minimize the cost to his father s pension plan he  intentionally trades more frequently in the accounts of other clients to ensure the required  brokerage is incurred to continue receiving free research for use by all the pensions 
8,141,Comment  Chan is violating Standard III B  because his trading actions are  disadvantaging his clients to enhance a relationship with a preferred client  All  clients are benefiting from the research being provided and should incur their fair  portion of the costs  This does not mean that additional trading should occur if a  client has not paid an equal portion of the commission  trading should occur only as  required by the strategy

6,142,Paul Rove performance analyst for Alpha Beta Investment Management is describing to the  firm s chief investment officer  CIO  two new reports he would like to develop to assist the  firm in meeting its obligations to treat clients fairly  Because many of the firm s clients have  similar investment objectives and portfolios Rove suggests a report detailing securities owned  across several clients and the percentage of the portfolio the security represents  The second  report would compare the monthly performance of portfolios with similar strategies  The  outliers within each report would be submitted to the CIO for review 
7,142,Comment  As a performance analyst Rove likely has little direct contact with  clients and thus has limited opportunity to treat clients differently  The  recommended reports comply with Standard III B  while helping the firm conduct  after the fact reviews of how effectively the firm s advisers are dealing with their  clients  portfolios  Reports that monitor the fair treatment of clients are an  important oversight tool to ensure that clients are treated fairly

10,143,  Managing to an Index or Mandate
11,143,Standard III C  requires that members and candidates who are in an investment advisory  relationship with clients consider carefully the needs circumstances and objectives of the  clients when determining the appropriateness and suitability of a given investment or course of  investment action  An appropriate suitability determination will not however prevent some  investments or investment actions from losing value 
12,143,In judging the suitability of a potential investment the member or candidate should review  many aspects of the client s knowledge experience related to investing and financial situation   These aspects include but are not limited to the risk profile of the investment as compared with  the constraints of the client the impact of the investment on the diversity of the portfolio and  whether the client has the means or net worth to assume the associated risk  The investment  professional s determination of suitability should reflect only the investment recommendations  or actions that a prudent person would be willing to undertake  Not every investment  opportunity will be suitable for every portfolio regardless of the potential return being offered 
13,143,The responsibilities of members and candidates to gather information and make a suitability  analysis prior to making a recommendation or taking investment action fall on those members  and candidates who provide investment advice in the course of an advisory relationship with a  client  Other members and candidates may be simply executing specific instructions for retail  clients when buying or selling securities such as shares in mutual funds  These members and  candidates and some others such as sell side analysts may not have the opportunity to judge  the suitability of a particular investment for the ultimate client

2,144,Developing an Investment Policy
3,144,When an advisory relationship exists members and candidates must gather client information at  the inception of the relationship  Such information includes the client s financial circumstances  personal data  such as age and occupation  that are relevant to investment decisions attitudes  toward risk and objectives in investing  This information should be incorporated into a written  investment policy statement  IPS  that addresses the client s risk tolerance return requirements  and all investment constraints  including time horizon liquidity needs tax concerns legal and  regulatory factors and unique circumstances   Without identifying such client factors members  and candidates cannot judge whether a particular investment or strategy is suitable for a  particular client  The IPS also should identify and describe the roles and responsibilities of the  parties to the advisory relationship and investment process as well as schedules for review and  evaluation of the IPS  After formulating long term capital market expectations members and  candidates can assist in developing an appropriate strategic asset allocation and investment  program for the client whether these are presented in separate documents or incorporated in the  IPS or in appendices to the IPS 
4,144,Understanding the Client s Risk Profile
5,144,One of the most important factors to be considered in matching appropriateness and suitability  of an investment with a client s needs and circumstances is measuring that client s tolerance for  risk  The investment professional must consider the possibilities of rapidly changing investment  environments and their likely impact on a client s holdings both individual securities and the  collective portfolio  The risk of many investment strategies can and should be analyzed and  quantified in advance 
6,144,The use of synthetic investment vehicles and derivative investment products has introduced  particular issues of risk  Members and candidates should pay careful attention to the leverage  inherent in many of these vehicles or products when considering them for use in a client s  investment program  Such leverage and limited liquidity depending on the degree to which  they are hedged bear directly on the issue of suitability for the client 
7,144,Updating an Investment Policy
8,144,Updating the IPS should be repeated at least annually and also prior to material changes to any  specific investment recommendations or decisions on behalf of the client  The effort to  determine the needs and circumstances of each client is not a one time occurrence  Investment  recommendations or decisions are usually part of an ongoing process that takes into account the  diversity and changing nature of portfolio and client characteristics  The passage of time is  bound to produce changes that are important with respect to investment objectives 
9,144,For an individual client important changes might include the number of dependents personal  tax status health liquidity needs risk tolerance amount of wealth beyond that represented in  the portfolio and extent to which compensation and other income provide for current income  needs  With respect to an institutional client such changes might relate to the magnitude of  unfunded liabilities in a pension fund the withdrawal privileges in an employee savings plan or  the distribution requirements of a charitable foundation  Without efforts to update information  concerning client factors one or more factors could change without the investment manager s  knowledge

2,145,Suitability review can be done most effectively when the client fully discloses his or her  complete financial portfolio including those portions not managed by the member or candidate   If clients withhold information about their financial portfolios the suitability analysis conducted  by members and candidates cannot be expected to be complete  it must be based on the  information provided 
3,145,The Need for Diversification
4,145,The investment profession has long recognized that combining several different investments is  likely to provide a more acceptable level of risk exposure than having all assets in a single  investment  The unique characteristics  or risks  of an individual investment may become  partially or entirely neutralized when it is combined with other individual investments within a  portfolio  Some reasonable amount of diversification is thus the norm for many portfolios  especially those managed by individuals or institutions that have some degree of legal fiduciary  responsibility 
5,145,An investment with high relative risk on its own may be a suitable investment in the context of  the entire portfolio or when the client s stated objectives contemplate speculative or risky  investments  The manager may be responsible for only a portion of the client s total portfolio  or the client may not have provided a full financial picture  Members and candidates can be  responsible for assessing the suitability of an investment only on the basis of the information  and criteria actually provided by the client 
6,145,Addressing Unsolicited Trading Requests
7,145,Members and candidates may receive requests from a client for trades that do not properly align  with the risk and return objectives outlined in the client s investment policy statement  These  transaction requests may be based on the client s individual biases or professional experience   Members and candidates will need to make reasonable efforts to balance their clients  trading  requests with their responsibilities to follow the agreed on investment policy statement 
8,145,In cases of unsolicited trade requests that a member or candidate knows are unsuitable for a  client the member or candidate should refrain from making the trade until he or she discusses  the concerns with the client  The discussions and resulting actions may encompass a variety of  scenarios depending on how the requested unsuitable investment relates to the client s full  portfolio 
9,145,Many times an unsolicited request may be expected to have only a minimum impact on the  entire portfolio because the size of the requested trade is small or the trade would result in a  limited change to the portfolio s risk profile  In discussing the trade the member or candidate  should focus on educating the investor on how the request deviates from the current policy  statement  Following the discussion the member or candidate may follow his or her firm s  policies regarding the necessary client approval for executing unsuitable trades  At a minimum  the client should acknowledge the discussion and accept the conditions that make the  recommendation unsuitable 
10,145,Should the unsolicited request be expected to have a material impact on the portfolio the  member or candidate should use this opportunity to update the investment policy statement   Doing so would allow the client to fully understand the potential effect of the requested trade on  his or her current goals or risk levels

2,146,Members and candidates may have some clients who decline to modify their policy statements  while insisting an unsolicited trade be made  In such instances members or candidates will need  to evaluate the effectiveness of their services to the client  The options available to the members  or candidates will depend on the services provided by their employer  Some firms may allow  for the trade to be executed in a new unmanaged account  If alternative options are not  available members and candidates ultimately will need to determine whether they should  continue the advisory arrangement with the client 
3,146,Managing to an Index or Mandate
4,146,Some members and candidates do not manage money for individuals but are responsible for  managing a fund to an index or an expected mandate  The responsibility of these members and  candidates is to invest in a manner consistent with the stated mandate  For example a member  or candidate who serves as the fund manager for a large cap income fund would not be  following the fund mandate by investing heavily in small cap or start up companies whose  stock is speculative in nature  Members and candidates who manage pooled assets to a specific  mandate are not responsible for determining the suitability of the fund as an investment for  investors who may be purchasing shares in the fund  The responsibility for determining the  suitability of an investment for clients can be conferred only on members and candidates who  have an advisory relationship with clients 
5,146,Recommended Procedures for Compliance
6,146,Investment Policy Statement
7,146,To fulfill the basic provisions of Standard III C  a member or candidate should put the needs  and circumstances of each client and the client s investment objectives into a written investment  policy statement  In formulating an investment policy for the client the member or candidate  should take the following into consideration 
8,146,  client identification     type and nature of client     the existence of separate  beneficiaries and     approximate portion of total client assets that the member or  candidate is managing 
9,146,  investor objectives     return objectives  income growth in principal maintenance of  purchasing power  and     risk tolerance  suitability stability of values  
10,146,  investor constraints     liquidity needs     expected cash flows  patterns of additions  and or withdrawals      investable funds  assets and liabilities or other commitments       time horizon     tax considerations     regulatory and legal circumstances      investor preferences prohibitions circumstances and unique needs and     proxy voting  responsibilities and guidance  and

2,147,Regular Updates
3,147,The investor s objectives and constraints should be maintained and reviewed periodically to  reflect any changes in the client s circumstances  Members and candidates should regularly  compare client constraints with capital market expectations to arrive at an appropriate asset  allocation  Changes in either factor may result in a fundamental change in asset allocation   Annual review is reasonable unless business or other reasons such as a major change in market  conditions dictate more frequent review  Members and candidates should document attempts to  carry out such a review if circumstances prevent it 
4,147,Suitability Test Policies
5,147,With the increase in regulatory required suitability tests members and candidates should  encourage their firms to develop related policies and procedures  The procedures will differ  according to the size of the firm and the scope of the services offered to its clients 
6,147,The test procedures should require the investment professional to look beyond the potential  return of the investment and include the following 
7,147,  an analysis of the impact on the portfolio s diversification
8,147,  a comparison of the investment risks with the client s assessed risk tolerance and
9,147,  the fit of the investment with the required investment strategy 
10,147,Application of the Standard
11,147,Example    Investment Suitability Risk Profile  
12,147,Caleb Smith an investment adviser has two clients  Larry Robertson    years old and Gabriel  Lanai    years old  Both clients earn roughly the same salary but Robertson has a much higher  risk tolerance because he has a large asset base  Robertson is willing to invest part of his assets  very aggressively  Lanai wants only to achieve a steady rate of return with low volatility to pay  for his children s education  Smith recommends investing     of both portfolios in zero yield  small cap high technology equity issues 
13,147,Comment  In Robertson s case the investment may be appropriate because of his  financial circumstances and aggressive investment position but this investment is  not suitable for Lanai  Smith is violating Standard III C  by applying Robertson s  investment strategy to Lanai because the two clients  financial circumstances and  objectives differ

2,148,Example    Investment Suitability Entire Portfolio  
3,148,Jessica McDowell an investment adviser suggests to Brian Crosby a risk averse client that  covered call options be used in his equity portfolio  The purpose would be to enhance Crosby s  income and partially offset any untimely depreciation in the portfolio s value should the stock  market or other circumstances affect his holdings unfavorably  McDowell educates Crosby  about all possible outcomes including the risk of incurring an added tax liability if a stock rises  in price and is called away and conversely the risk of his holdings losing protection on the  downside if prices drop sharply 
4,148,Comment  When determining suitability of an investment the primary focus should  be the characteristics of the client s entire portfolio not the characteristics of single  securities on an issue by issue basis  The basic characteristics of the entire portfolio  will largely determine whether investment recommendations are taking client  factors into account  Therefore the most important aspects of a particular  investment are those that will affect the characteristics of the total portfolio  In this  case McDowell properly considers the investment in the context of the entire  portfolio and thoroughly explains the investment to the client 
5,148,Example    IPS Updating  
6,148,In a regular meeting with client Seth Jones the portfolio managers at Blue Chip Investment  Advisors are careful to allow some time to review his current needs and circumstances  In doing  so they learn that some significant changes have recently taken place in his life  A wealthy  uncle left Jones an inheritance that increased his net worth fourfold to US   million 
7,148,Comment  The inheritance has significantly increased Jones s ability  and possibly  his willingness  to assume risk and has diminished the average yield required to  meet his current income needs  Jones s financial circumstances have definitely  changed so Blue Chip managers must update Jones s investment policy statement  to reflect how his investment objectives have changed  Accordingly the Blue Chip  portfolio managers should consider a somewhat higher equity ratio for his portfolio  than was called for by the previous circumstances and the managers  specific  common stock recommendations might be heavily tilted toward low yield growth  oriented issues 
8,148,Example    Following an Investment Mandate  
9,148,Louis Perkowski manages a high income mutual fund  He purchases zero dividend stock in a  financial services company because he believes the stock is undervalued and is in a potential  growth industry which makes it an attractive investment 
10,148,Comment  A zero dividend stock does not seem to fit the mandate of the fund that  Perkowski is managing  Unless Perkowski s investment fits within the mandate or  is within the realm of allowable investments the fund has made clear in its  disclosures Perkowski has violated Standard III C
